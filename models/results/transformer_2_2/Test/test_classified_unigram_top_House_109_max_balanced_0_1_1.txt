those loud clear voices on behalf of limited federal government limited federal expenditures and i am proud that he has come out tonight to help us with this let me flush out what he was talking about in terms of increased federal receipts back in january of this year the cbo estimated that fiscal year 2005s tax receipts federal receipts would be about 2 045 trillion cbo is an organization that gets paid to try to estimate these things they generally do a really good job when we finished out the year i was looking at the same treasury report that my colleague made reference to awhile ago and for fiscal year 2005 which ended september 30 2005 receipts were 2 153 trillion over 100 billion more in federal tax receipts than we had estimated just 9 months previously so the numbers we have been talking about tonight the 50 billion in tax cuts the 56 billion and the impact extending the current tax law will have on tax revenues pale against over 108 to 109 billion of increased federal revenues that has come about as a result of the progrowth projob creation tax policy that was put in collectively in 2001 to 2003 in addition to that good news at the end of last week the gdp growth for the third quarter of calendar year 2005 was 4 3 percent that is a good growth rate on any economy a developing economy or whatever it is but let us make sure that we understand this is on the single largest economy in the world it grew 4 3 percent in the third quarter and that is staggering growth under any conclusion fl 2215 the unemployment rate was mentioned earlier as being as low as 5 percent that is full unemployment in reckoning of many economists and is certainly lower than the averages of unemployment of the previous 3 decades the decade of the 1970s which you remember we had a big depression then and as a result of a runup in oil and gas prices we had lower than in the 1980s when those of us in the oil business experienced a significant downturn in 1986 and later and then lower than the boom years of the 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as anybody thought it would ever be the current unemployment rate is actually lower than that statistics are full of all kind of odd and important indexes that statisticians and economists use to try to make projections as to where the economy is going one of those that you do not hear a lot about is the consumer confidence index and that is supposed to be a measure of how consumers feel about themselves are they going to go spend money do they feel comfortable with their job and those kinds of things it jumped from an 85 2 percent rating in october to a 98 9 percent rating in november a 1month jump of over 13 points in consumer confidence what that tells us is that retailers for the christmas season ought to do very well one of my colleagues today said go try to find a parking spot in the mall these days and for all of the doom and gloom that is out there in the media it is not being reflected in americans going to the malls and working on christmas gifts and charity gifts for other folks that do not have it so the consumer confidence is up another statistic that gets talked about a little bit is that sales of new homes jumped 13 percent in october the largest 1 month percentage gain in 12 years and new singlefamily homes also climbed to an alltime record high of 1 42 million units more people again as we have said several times tonight more people owning a home in america than have ever owned a home now 1 month does not make a trend but continuing to talk about federal tax receipts and revenues the first month of fiscal year 2006 was the month of october of 2005 and during that first month federal tax receipts were about 149 billion and a year ago the equivalent month in october of fiscal 2005 which was october of 2004 federal tax receipts was 137 billion so a 12 billion gain in just 1 month against previous years months now you have got to be careful that may or may not be a trend but it is hard to say it is bad news thai the tax receipts for october of this year are greater than tax receipts for october of last year i think that is good news i would also like to point out a couple of tax provisions that are included in the extension that we will do later on this week that are important and one of those would continue the tax deduction for state and local sales taxes for states that do not have a state income tax states like yours and mine and my former colleague texas does not have a state income tax and so this provision would allow texans to deduct rather than the state income taxes to deduct state and local taxes which are used to fund many of the exact same programs that states who have income taxes use those taxes to provide goods and services to their citizens another deduction that is extended is the abovetheline deduction for higher education expenses now trying not to bore everyone with tax returnese or speak abovetheline deductions means that you get to detect that without having to itemize your deductions so higher education expenses the deduction for that is continued as well as an important expenditure for many teachers who find the school budgets do not provide some of the extras and maybe even sometimes some of the essentials that a teacher needs in providing a good classroom experience for her students teachers get to deduct their outofpocket expenses above the line which means they dont have to itemize deductions to get to deduct those personal expenses that the teacher may pay one that i came across tonight or an example of one i came across tonight is the tax incentive to revitalize the district of columbia included in the code of the past two tax cuts has been a 5 000 tax credit for anyone any new first time home purchaser here in the district of columbia well one of the folks on my staff who as you know staff are legendarily overworked and way underpaid one of the folks on my staff 2 years ago took advantage of this provision and bought his first home and has begun to build equity in that home over the past 2 years and would not have been able to do that were this tax provision not in place when you sell a home you have bought it from somebody who previously owned it hopefully and in all likelihood that person is going to go invest that money in another home so it is important that we have firsttime buyers to work into the market work into the housing market because as we stated earlier for many families the ownership of a home is the single largest asset that they have in their portfolio and this gentleman now has a home that he is paying a mortgage on of course but is building equity in that home building equity in his personal wealth and he is going to be better off as a result of having done that let me talk about something that we probably should have talked about right off the bat and that is the federal government does not grow this economy a lot of times the federal government gets a lot more credit for good economic news than it deserves and in all likelihood sometimes a lot more of the blame for bad economies than it deserves but the truth of the matter is a growing economy that we have right now is not created by a federal government it was created by hundreds of thousands of hard working americans employees who go to work every day and work for their employer to try to provide a good or a service that that employer can sell and make money on selfemployed individuals who have gone out there and taken the business risk of leaving that paycheck leaving the security of a check every 2 weeks to try to make it on their own those are the folks who are building this growing economy who are adding people to their payrolls who are hiring new people or setting up additional businesses to take advantage of opportunities that we are having in this growing economy so we cannot overstate the value of the hard working american in growing this economy but we do have some risks a lot of times of overstating the impact the federal government has in my view the role of the federal government is to get out of the way of these hardworking americans and let them continue to grow this economy pay their fair share of taxes of course but let us not do things that puts the government in the way of creating jobs gets in the way of furthering homeownership gets in the way of growing this economy and providing new opportunities for men and women in this country i participated in back in the early 1990s in a needs assessment for midland texas this was an attempt to survey on a statistically valid basis throughout midland county what were the needs of people within midland what were the needs of your family what were the needs in your neighborhood what were the needs within the overall community and we got all of this information together and began to sort them into like items and pared the list down to 10 so that we had in fact 10 top needs that the people in midland texas told us they were having in their homes their families their neighborhoods and the community and as you look down that list nine of those needs would have been positively impacted by a family that had a job it has been my experience that jobs cure an awful lot of ills within every community when families are working the family itself is better off communities are better off the strains on the social network that is the united way that is all those social charities that we have in place to create that safety net that is so vital in every single one of our communities is less strained when more people have jobs it is also better supported when more people have jobs so it is important that we give credit where credit is due with respect to this growing economy the gentleman from texas mentioned one of his or three actually of his constituents that are good examples of why these pro growth pro job creation tax policies are in effect now and that we ought to continue them in effect i want to talk about calvin fryar calvin is a good friend of mine from brownwood texas he and his partners own a company that distributes gasoline they also have convenience stores they hire people to work and he told me the other day at dinner that because we were talking about extension of these current tax cuts he said that the one that was the most important to him as a small business owner was the section 179 deduction section 179 provides for the immediate writeoff of certain equipment that is purchased by businesses and put into use each year and i think it is about 100 000 calvin told me that when that came into effect i think it was 2003 that it helped him make a decision to invest additional money into the businesses that he was trying to create and not only did he invest the amount of money that qualified him to immediately deduct that amount he also invested a lot of money on top of that and in doing so created jobs and not only did he create jobs for the people who built whatever it is he bought but he also created additional jobs for his company because he was expanding his opportunities within the gasoline distribution area as well as convenience stores so he was adding jobs to his business as a result of that one specific tax code that is expiring and under the tax law that we will pass hopefully pass on thursday will be continued another one of those that is very important and my colleagues earlier in the previous hour mentioned it and that is the tax rate on capital gains and dividends if you were to listen to the colleagues on the other side it is as if the federal government has some innate claim to some portion of your capital gains some portion of your dividends and i would argue that that is not logical where is it stated anywhere that the federal government has a claim on selling property that you have held selling property that you have invested in selling a business that you built from scratch why is it that the federal government has a claim to a certain amount of that and right now under the current tax law the federal government has a claim on 15 percent of that capital gain or 15 percent of those dividends that may or may not be correct it is the law of the land but certainly increasing that number you would have to answer the question is all right why does the federal government have a claim on or does it own in some way the capital gain that i get when i sell stocks and bonds or when i sell a business why is it that the other side believes that a higher tax rate on capital gains is somehow some right of the federal government that is not if we were to let those current tax provisions expire capital gains would get thrown back up to the previously high percentage rates everything is going to get thrown back in with ordinary income the taxable income rates and we will be right back into a circumstance where we are raising taxes the wrong way raising taxes by raising rates as opposed to raising taxes by having an economy that is growing at a staggering rate providing new jobs to workers in this country so i would argue against that as we close out this hour if you look at the reporting we are talking about the economy tonight and if you look at reporting of economic news it is i guess an attempt to be balanced balance is rarely neutral though you will hear somebody talk about well you know this economic statistic is looking up and looking better but if that path continues it will drive us into higher interest rates or if we have got increased job growth or jobs going to be created at too fast a rate then that is going to drive up inflation so it is rare that you ever have good economic news simply presented as good economic news and maybe we will never get to a point where that happens hopefully on the nights that we get to come in here and talk about the economy get to brag on the economy actually we will be able to help set the record straight as i mentioned earlier my good colleague mr hensarling has said often that we are all entitled to our own opinion but we are only entitled to one set of facts not our own set of facts just the set of facts as are out there hopefully we can be responsible for what we say in front of these microphones be held accountable for what we say the other side made a lot tonight about accountability and all those kinds of things i would argue that that same accountability ought to go to things that are said from behind these microphones if i have said something that is incorrect if i have made an insinuation or made some sort of a comment that was intended to mislead that i am called to account for that and i would hope the other side would ascribe to that same kind of philosophy that the folks in the chamber tonight who are listening to this debate or listening to these arguments not really debate since we are not going back and forth but listening to the three of us put out information that we believe is important for the american people to hear and to understandand to understand how we are coming to the conclusions that we are coming too that we be held to a very high standard of what we say and that we are able to back up each and everything that we do say with facts that are verifiable so i want to thank you tonight for being able to lead this hour and i want to thank my colleague from texas mr hensarling for his role in our talk tonight and i want to also thank my freshman colleague from georgia mr price for his helping nie out tonight as well so the message i would leave with the american people is this that we have got a growing economy we have got an economy that is well grounded and is going to sustain this growth but that what we do not need to do is to increase taxes tax rates on that economy but that we continue the pro growth pro job creation tax rates that have been in effect since 2001 and 2003 e 2230"], [0.0007036575116217136,

amazed at news reports at home when i go home and i watch television news and i read the newspaper and see what is being portrayed as usual for the american public if you just followed those stories you would not believe that there was anything that was good or positive going on in our nation you would not believe that the economy for example was doing very very well so one of the things that i try to do and i know others try to do as well is to try to assist and bring about some truth in reporting so tonight what we would like to do is spend a little time talking about the economy for the american people know better than what they see on the nightly news and what they read in the newspapers in fact so many of the folks that i talk to at home are really tired of the gloom and doom that gets reported on the news and frankly gets stated over and over and over here in congress by some members they are tired of congressmen and women who put politics and partisanship over good policy and i hear so often back home that folks say why cant you just get something done on behalf of the american people well a lot of good things are getting done and we are going to spend a little time tonight talking about our economy and some things that congress is doing and has done to assist the american people to help american families to help american children to help american communities it is important that we do that because there is good news to tell so what we would like to do is spend a little time tonight and review so many of the positive things that have been done to create really an economy that is on the move i would like to begin by just sharing a number of different charts that demonstrate clearly that the economy is growing this is a chart here that i think really crystallizes so many of the good stories that we have to tell this chart begins in the first quarter of 2001 and along this axis here is the annual change in gdp or gross domestic product that is how well is the economy doing as you see for the first number of quarters of 2001 and 2002 it is kind of going along kind of bumping up and down and then there is a remarkable change that occurs in early 2003 from then on from the second quarter of 2003 on what we see is a gross domestic product growth in every quarter 10 quarters in a row of a growth of greater than 3 percent and oftentimes greater than 4 percent in faqt the most recent quarter grew at a rate of 4 3 percent the individual who wants to know how to continue that kind of growth and who is excited about policies that encourage growth would say well what happened what happened at that point to bring that kind of growth about as most people know what happened was that the tax cuts the tax relief that congress enacted on behalf of the hardworking american taxpayers went into effect and that has resulted in this incredible incredible growth in the economy that continues that continues unabated and what congress has an opportunity to do this week is to continue and extend that tax relief hopefully to be able to continue the lines that we have seen grow in the economy this is another chart that demonstrates the kind of response that the american economy has to that kind of activity this talks about the creation of new jobs in our country in fact since the spring of 2003 there have been 4 46 million new jobs that have come about and this chart shows the percent increase each month from early 2002 through the current time you see again there is that remarkable change that occurs in the early part and midparet of 2003 where the growth in the number of jobs is remarkable again the inquiring individual would want to know well what changed there what made it so that we did not have negative growth in jobs we had positive growth in jobs as everybody well knows now that change was the tax relief the tax relief that congress enacted that took place in early 2003 just to put those numbers all together this chart which is a little busy shows two very clearly distinct lines one is the green line down here that is the number of jobs that increase in our nation each month the red line is the level of unemployment and as you see at the beginning of 2003 the unemployment rate was taken up here somewhere around 6 percent and the number of jobs began to increase at this point when the tax relief package went into effect we see that continued increase and in fact right now the unemployment rate is down at 5 percent which is lower than the average for the decades of the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s some economists will tell you that 5 percent unemployment rate is full employment because you have got a number of folks who are between jobs or are working to find other places of employment that is their design so 5 percent is basically full employment the number of new jobs that was created last month 215 000 new jobs so there is good news to tell i have been joined tonight by many of my colleagues and many of them will share some of the same kinds of goodnews stories with you first i would like to yield the time to congresswoman blackburn from tennessee she has been such an incredible leader in this congress in the area of tax relief and in making certain that we enact the kinds of policies here that result in smaller government lower taxes and more opportunity for americans with that let me yield to congresswoman blackburn"], [0.0007684438023716211, 0.0007684438023716211, 0, "i rise in support of increased exploration drilling and production of natural gas off our intercontinental shelf this is an important issue for all of th country but especially true among ms 3 farmers and ranchers in kansas i am one who supports renewable fuels and ethanol and soy diesel pro 1 vide a great opportunity for economi u opportunity in kansas fot kansa farmers and for american agricultur f and for our country we must becom u much more independent from the en s ergy sources abroad but for our farmers and ranchers to remain in business to survive into the future they have got to have access to natural gas and at prices that are affordable natural gas is the primary feed stock the ingredient for the production of many agricultural components but especially for nitrogen fertilizer that is so important and if we are going to produce ethanol in this country if we are going to produce soy diesel we are going to have to have the fertilizer at an affordable price that will allow our farmers to raise the corn and grain sorghum to produce the ethanol to raise the soy beans to produce the soy diesel our farmers are struggling across the country input costs are dramatically on the rise nearly 40 percent of the nitrogen capacity fertilizer capacity has been shut down in this country since 1999 six years ago approximately 15 percent of our fertilizer needs were met in the united states from abroad today 50 percent is imported prices have increased dramatically 250 a ton for nitrogen fertilizer in 2002 today 416 one of my farmers who farms in southwest kansas 30 years ago when he started farming natural gas was 19 cents today it is 9 we are seeing double triple and even fourfold prices that donny young talks about in trying to stay in business with these increasing input costs while the price of corn has stayed the same we in the united states need to become independent if we are going to produce the ethanol and it is important that we remember that natural gas is necessary to make that nitrogen fertilizer i encourage the adoption of this proposal a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture agricultures ability to produce an affordable food supply will continue to face huge obstacles if our nation does not come to grips with its desire to have limitless resources like natural gas for production and not realize that these resources have to come from somewhere our natural gas crisis has two solutionsincrease supply and reduce demand h r 4761 addresses one aspect of this crisis as it will increase the supply of natural gas from the outer continental shelf this additional supply will do two things it will send a strong signal to natural gas markets and could increase the elasticity in north american natural gas markets it indicates to these futures markets that the united states is committed to lifting the moratoria in the outer continental shelf to provide consumers with an additional supply of natural gas this message should ease the volatility in natural gas prices that all of us have seen since 1999 and the additional supply should help ease the natural gas prices over time why does agriculture care so much about this natural gas crisis simply put agriculture is a very large consumer of natural gas farm3 ers use significant amounts of natural gas for food processing irrigation crop drying heating farm buildings and homes and for the pro duction of crop protection chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers natural gas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers manufactured in the untied states natural gas is not just an energy source it is the raw material for producing the fertilizer today in the case of the nitrogen fertilizer anhydrous ammonia natural gas accounts for over 90 percent of the total cash cost of production just like kansas wheat and wisconsin milk fertilizer is a commodity bought and sold worldwide and subject to basic global supply and demand economic principles as the unitedstates domestic nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing sector declines due to high natural gas prices kansas farmers and other unitedstates food producers will be subject to global supply demand forces on the fertilizer products they buy even more so than today the climb in natural gas prices since 2q00 has forced unitedstates fertilizer production costs to unprecedented levels over this period of high prices and intense volatility the unitedstates fertilizer industry began to shut down production nearly 40 percent of the industrys nitrogen capacity permanently shut down between 1999 and today this has and will continue to make unitedstates farmers dependent on offshore production from the major suppliers such as saudi arabia venezuela and russia this rise in natural gas prices and the permanent closure of so much unitedstates fertilizer production has dramatically impacted fertilizer prices throughout the marketing chain and in particular at the farm level according to usda unitedstates prices to farmers for ammonia climbed from 250 per ton in 2002 to 416 per ton in 2005 that is almost a doubling of the price of ammonia to farmers this continued loss of production from the unitedstates nitrogen fertilizer industry would force farmers to rely on a highly uncertain and highly volatile world market with no assurance that they will be able to obtain enough product to meet their full demand this is particularly important when considering the importance of nitrogen to farmers thirty to 50 percent of corn yields are directly attributed to nitrogen fertilizer passing h r 4761 represents a direct positive action to increase our nations domestic natural gas supply to help relieve the high prices pressuring american farmers fertilizer producers and homeowners allowing exploration and development of the outer continental shelf is an essential commitment that our nation must make these natural resources belong to all americans and should be developed for the benefit of the entire nation a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture please support passage of h r 4761"], [0.0008329460979439318, 0.0008329460979439318, 0, "i received an announcement this morning from the department of the army it is a casualty announcement that unfortunately we all receive from time to time and it says the united states army announces the loss of private aaron m hudson 20 of highland village texas who died on april 16 2005 in taji iraq in support of operation iraqi freedom according to initial reports private hudson died from injuries sustained on april 15 2005 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his patrol private hudson was assigned to the 401st military police company the 720th military police battalion out of fort hood texas private hudsons family resides in highland village texas the army extends heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his family who have suffered this loss well i thought i should do something to perhaps fill in a little bit more about the life of private hudson and although i did not know private hudson we did reside in the same city for a while private hudson was a 2002 graduate of marcus high school in flower mound texas he joined the army a year ago and left for iraq in january and he was serving at the 401st military police company the majority of the information that i am going to tell the house tonight came from a newspaper article in the dallas morning news from monday april 18 2005 and i will insert that into the record at the conclusion of my remarks private hudson was traveling in a convoy between baghdad and camp taji on friday performing a routine patrol delivering mail mr hudson his fathpr said he was the gunner in his military police team and was charged with security at the rear of the convoy when a roadside bomb exploded a large piece of shrapnel shot through his body armor and struck him in the chest private hudson was born may 17 1984 in dallas he played baseball soccer and basketball growing up but his main high school sport was golf i received a phone call from a highland village policeman chuck barr who was a nextdoor neighbor of private hudson chuck being a policeman you might imagine is somewhat circumspect about young men as they grow up but he had no such reservations about aaron hudson he told me that he trusted aaron completely he and his wife dawn frequently used aaron as a babysitter for their young children and the photograph provided to me by chuck barr the policeman in highland village shows him and mr barrs son sitting at their home in highland village officer barr related that aaron had fun but he never got into trouble he said he and his wife dawn used to always know when aaron arrived home at night because his truck was a little bit loud as it pulled into the driveway next door i cannot even imagine the pain that mark hudson and angela hudson aarons parents are going through this evening and this week i called mark hudson today and even though he was suffering enormously he did take the time to talk to me a little bit about his son and his sons life i told him that i would be speaking on the floor of the house tonight about his son and he said i want you to tell the other members of congress that his son aaron was proud to be a soldier he said as a father i could not ask for more than for my child to go and help people halfway across the world people he had never met before to go and help them and to give his life in trying to extricate themfrom tyranny mr hudson wanted this body to know how much he supported the other young men and women over in iraq this evening how much he supported them in their effort to provide freedom for theiraqi people mr hudson told me that aaron loved to be called a soldier mr hudson reminded me that tonight in the hudson household the casualty rate is at 100 percent but still he wanted me to convey that he and his family harbored no ill will against the iraqi people it was clear in mr hudsons mind his son had been murdered by criminals by a criminal element in the country of iraq and not the iraqi people that his son had gone to help mr hudson also asked me to say a special note of thanks to a gentleman and unfortunately mr hudson did not know this gentlemans first name or his rank but he was with aaron in the 401st military police division the mans name is robertson he went through basic training with aaron and they deployed together in iraq and it was robertson who got young aaron onto the medivac helicopter and probably it was mr robertson who heard aarons last words mr hudson said that the letters he got back from his son were always upbeat he never complained about things like the food he never complained about his life in iraq he loved the camaraderie and the structure of being around his fellow soldiers mr hudson said in the newspaper article lets face it he would rather have been home but he knew why he was there and he knew his being there was important well mark hudson angela hudson i want you to know that just as we heard the gentlewoman from florida ileana roslehtinen say when she was speaking of her stepson that was going to be deployed on behalf of a grateful nation we say thank you as aaron comes home this week i again would say thank you"], [0.0008702874183654785, 0.9991297125816345, 1, "i just want to make sure mr ryan that the american people understand what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their

you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and

sacrament the sacrament of penance which they call reconciliation it is a time when you revisit your own life to take a close look at how your daily actions square with what you believe as a catholic looking at this budget i cannot square the moral values of our country opportunity equality and justice with the practical impact that this budget proposal will have on the lives of working american families this year thanks to president bushs taxcutting progtam the unitedstates government will deliver up to 106 billion to the multiple bank accounts of some of the wealthiest americans this government program to help wealthy americans spend more money now forces a false crunch on our resources a 50 billion cut that republicans believe should come from medicaid food stamps and student loans who will feel the impact of these cuts well almost 60percent of all people in nursing homes who are on medicaid and onethird of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans that strive to even the playing field for all american families eight weeks ago across the united states americans saw the faces of other americans staring up at them from television screens scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it poverty is on the rise in our country 37 million americans are now in poverty i a family of two in povertya single mother with her child is living on 1 069 a month about 14 million americans are living on half of poverty a single mother with her child living at half of poverty is trying to survive on 535 a month that is two people living on 123 37 a week and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other americans we will be judged by how we take care of the least of our people we will be judged by our decision to turn our backs on those americans who were driven to cry out helpwe are your neighbors your grandmothers your children i urge my colleagues to vote no on this shortsighted fiscally irresponsible and immoral

budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0009413361549377441, 0.9990586638450623, 1, "it is an honor to come before the house we would like to thank not only democratic leader ms pelosi but the entire democratic leadership mr hoyer mr menendez and mr clyburn our vice chair of the democratic caucus as you know the 30something working group comes to the floor to share not only with members but also with the american people about what is happening good here in the capitol and also what is happening bad here in the capitol and hopefully through a bipartisan effort we can move towards positive change here in the capitol it saddens me to report the fact that this congress need it be whatever poll you look at the american people by 33 percent think that we are doing a good job thirtythree percent of the american people feel that this congress is doing a good job i would tell you that if it was a grade system i would assume that and members i would assume that that would be a failing grade i have two children that attend school and if their grades were based on a 33 percent performance i do not think that they would be moving to the next grade and i think it is important members of congress as we start to look at our responsibilities to the american people not just to our constituents in our districts but to the american people because by them sending us to congress they federalized us to come up here and run this country in the way that it should be i also want to remind the members that this is the peoples house it is not my house it is not mr ryans house it is not ms wasserman schultzs house all due respect it is not your house it is the peoples house in the senate i must add and we must let all of the members we must remind them in the senate someone can be appointed to the senate of course they have elections but in a time let us just say like in new jersey the governor of new jersey the new governor of new jersey has the opportunity who was a unitedstates senator to appoint someone to be the new unitedstates senator from the state of new jersey but in the house with a seat being vacated let us just say someone from new jersey is appointed to be the senator he cannot appoint someone here to the house of representatives he would have to set a special election for that seat to be filled constitutionally so this is the peoples house and so when we start talking about the people of the united states of america we are closer to them than any other i think than any other branch of government i would like to say that on the heels of president bushs speech today on iraqs economy i could not help and mr ryan and i just returned from iraq we visited three cities in iraq and we went to the infamous green zone and baghdad visiting our troops many of them were members of the army soldiers some on their third deployment to iraq i could not help but pay attention and i got a copy of the presidents h11199 speech and he released a 35page 32 pages if you look at glossy cover and all 35 pages of his strategy for victory there in iraq but he talked about the economy today in iraq but i cannot help but say and to the members that it would have been good if the president could have talked about our unitedstates economy i think the reason why he did not talk about the unitedstates economy is the fact that we have record deficits some 3 5 trillion over the next 10 years deficits that is not the kendrick meek report that is not the tim ryan report that is not the congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz report that is reality we are recordbreaking as it relates to borrowing money members from foreign countries this president along with this republican majority here in the house and in the senate has achieved 4 5 trillion in borrowing money from foreign nations more than 42 presidents before him they were only able to among all of those presidents i mean all of them i am talking about since we became a country 4 1 trillion that have been achieved and i want to correct myself i am sorry i have so many numbers here i want to correct myself i am glad mr ryan brought this over 1 05 trillion by this president i said four and i will correct myself right now because in the 30something working group we believe in thirdparty validators and sharing with the american people and the members the truth about what is happening here in the capitol so maybe 4 05 might have sounded a little better but we believe in making sure that we give good information 1 05 trillion this president the last 4 years 2001 to 2005 and he is not done yet 1 01 trillion 42 presidents in the history of this country republican democrat and in their lifetime for some of them very early on were members of the whig party from 1776 to 2000 224 years and this is from the unitedstates department of treasury this is not from the national democratic party or anything like that we just want to make sure mr ryan that we have our thirdparty validators here maybe the president mr ryan could have talked abouit the fact that health care costs increased over 60 percent for small businesses over the last 5 years major companies are cutting jobs and not only their pension plan that they promised but they are following our lead here under this republican majority mr ryan by the fact that we are not only increasing copayments and the wait for our veterans once they leave the military they are following our lead companies like gm delphi merck verizon and now ford are now reprioritizing that means cutting jobs that means cutting back on promises that they promised their employees from the beginning the average family right now in the united states as relates to natural gas are paying three times more than they paid in 2001 the president could have talked about that but he did not he wanted to talk about iraq because he needs to explain himself republican majority they need to explain themselves sixty percent of americans if we like it or not do not believe that our leadership as relates to leading our effort in iraq has a sound plan in getting us out of there so we are going to talk about some of these things tonight we are going to also talk about this ongoing culture of corruption andc cronyism and incompetence this is not the kendrick meek report this is just todays papers this is just today that is outlining a culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence so when historians look back on the 109th congress and the contributions that we made they are also going to look at the void in leadership and leading this country in the way that they should lead we used to give speeches here on the floor mr ryan and you know full well about putting burden on future generations fl 2015 well i can tell the members right now and this is not me speaking they can check with any of the federal agencies that do the reports or the auditor generals that put out reports on an annual basis we are putting this generation in the present in jeopardy so i am so glad that we have the opportunity tonight to come to the floor and i am so glad that the gentleman from ohio is here and i am glad that we have a level of consistency for the american people to come to the floor and share this information i yield to the gentleman from ohio"], [0.000947415828704834,

remarks the fact that she also is a member who has one of the largest constituencies in not only the state of california of our asian pacific american community but as ms pelosi was making her statement i recalled also her predecessor someone whom i have had the highest admiration and respect for a giant of a man not only in his ways but as an example with a real great sensitivity and compassion for the needs of the asian pacific american community people none other than the late congressman phil burton i would also like to commend my colleagues congresswoman juanita millendermcdonald and congressman al green for their outstanding remarks this evening in this special order i rise today in celebration of the asian pacific american heritage month to acknowledge the contributions of our asian pacific american individuals and communities to the success of our great nation i commend my colleagues who founded this celebration in 1977 by introducing a resolution calling upon the president to proclaim the first 10 days in may asian pacific heritage week former representatives norm mineta and frank horton and senators daniel k inouye and senator spark matsunaga i think we need to also understand the dynamics those of us who are americans and we are very very proud of being americans but whose roots are from the asian pacific region and the dynamics of why the asian pacific region is so important it is in our national interests not only our national security the economics just about every phase of what is really critically important in our nation in dealing with this region of the world which by the way twothirds of the worlds population is the asian pacific region six of the 10 largest armies in the world are in the asian pacific region our trade with the asian pacific region is four times greater than any other region in the world including especially that of europe i am reminded a couple of years ago what senator inouye said for every one 747 that flies between the atlantic and the united states four 747s fly between the asian pacific region and our country the asian pacific american community is vibrant and growing with an estimated 14 million asian american residents and another 975 000 pacific americans i am proud to be a member of this asian pacific american community a community that has produced so many inspiring individuals in government in the military in the sciences sports entertainment business you name it we have it in government for example especially from the great state of hawaii among the first i guess you might say unitedstates senator hiram fong senator daniel inouye senator daniel akaka the first elected asian american governor of any state governor george ariyoshi our first native hawaiian governor governor john waihee our first filipino american governor governor ben cayetano we also have mayor neal blaisdell and the newly elected mayor of the city and county of honolulu mufi hannemann we also have lieutenant governors jimmy kealoha and duke ainoa norm mineta a good friend of mine who is not only partly responsible for initiating this heritage month but was always the first asian pacific american mayor of a major unitedstates city like san jose he was also the first asian pacific american to be a member of a presidential cabinet when he was appointed as secretary of commerce in the year 2000 by former president clinton and now is unitedstates secretary of transportation appointed by president bush elaine chao another first secretary chao is the first female asian american cabinet member appointed secretary of labor by president bush gary locke first asian american governor on the mainland united states elected governor of the state of washington in 1996 and i could never forget and my deepest respect to the late congresswoman patsy mink first asian american female elected to the unitedstates congress since 1964 then our late colleague and friend my dear friend the late congressman bob matsui who inspired me and mentored me throughout our time here together as a senior member of the house committee on ways and means as a vietnam veteran it would be ludicrous for me not to say something to honor the hundreds of thousands of asian pacific americans who have and continue to serve in all the branches of the armed services of our nation i would like to share with you the contributions of tens of thousands of japanese american soldiers who volunteered to fight our nations enemies in europe during world war ii we are all aware of the fact that after the surprise attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 by the imperial army of japan there was such an outrage and cry for an allout war against japan in days afterwards our president and the congress formally declared war but caught in this crossfire were hundreds of thousands of americans mind you americans who happened to be of japanese ancestry our national government immediately implemented a policy whereby over 100 000 americans of japanese ancestry were forced to live in what were called supposedly relocation camps i call them concentration camps their lands their homes and their properties were confiscated without dueprocess of law it was also a time in our nations history that there was so much hatred and bigotry and racism against our japanese american community and yet despite all of this leaving their wives their parents their brothers and sisters behind barbedwire fences in these prison camps the white house accepted the requests from tens of thousands of japanese americans who volunteered to join the army and as a result two combat units were organized one was called the 100th battalion and the other was known as the 442nd infantry combat group both were sent to europe to fight and i might say that i am very very proud to have been associated and been a former member of the 100th battalion 442nd infantry combat group out of the state of hawaii in my humble opinion history speaks for itself in documenting that none have shed their blood more valiantly for our nation than the japanese american solders who served in those two combat units while fighting enemy forces in europe during world war h the military records of the 100th battalion and the 442nd infantry are without equal those japanese american units suffered an unprecedented casualty rate of 314 percent and received over 18 000 individual decorations many awarded posthumously for bravery and courage in the field of battle for your information 52 distinguished service crosses 560 silver stars and 9 480 purple hearts were awarded to the japanese american soldiers of the 100th battalion and 442nd infantry group i find it unusual however that only one medal of honor was given nonetheless the 442nd combat group emerged as the most decorated combat unit of its size in the history of the united states army president truman was so moved by their bravery in the field of battle as well as the tremendous sacrifices of the african american soldiers in world war ii that he issued an executive order to finally desegregate all of the branches of the armed services senator inouye lost his arm while engaged in battle against two german machine gun posts and he was awarded the distinguished service cross after a congressional mandate to review again the military records of these two combat units some 5 years ago i was privileged to attend a white house ceremony where president clinton presented 19 19 congressional medals of honor to the japanese american soldiers who were members of the 100th battalion and 442nd combat infantry senator inouye was one of those recipients of the congressional medal of honor i submit these japanese americans paid their dues in blood to protect our nation from its enemies it is a shameful mark on the history of our country that when the patriotic survivors of the 100th battalion and the 442nd infantry returned to the united states to be reunited with their families who were locked up behind barbed wire fences living in prison camps and could not even get a haircut in downtown san francisco simply because they looked japanese they were japanese and for that reason alone even with their uniforms on they were not given the privilege of getting a haircut my former colleague and now unitedstates secretary of transportation norm mineta and the fate congressman bob matsui from sacramento both spent some of the early years of their lives in these prison camps secretary mineta told me one of the interesting features of these prison camps was posting of machine gun nests all around the camp and everyone was told that these machine guns were posted to protect them against rioters but then secretary mineta observed if these machine guns were posted to guard us why is it that they are all directed inside the prison camp rather than outside it i submit ladies and gentlemen my good friends my colleagues the wholesale and arbitrary abolishment of the constitutional rights of these loyal japanese americans should forever serve as a reminder and testament that this must never be allowed to occur again when this miscarriage of justice unfolded during world war ii americans of german and italian ancestry were not similarly jailed en masse some declared the incident as an outright example of racism and bigotry in its ugliest form after viewing the holocaust museum in washington i understand better why the genocide of some 6 million jews has prompted the cry never again neveragain likewise i sincerely hope that mass internments on the basis of race alone will never again darken the pages of the history of this great nation now to those who say well that happened decades ago we must say that we have to continue to be on our guard for this kind of thing to happen again i remember years ago the case of bruce yamashita the japanese american born and raised in the state of hawaii who was discharged from the marine corps after a training program as an officer candidate and an ugly display of racial discrimination the marine corps superiors taunted yamashita with ethnic slurs and told him we do not want your kind around here go back to your own country the situation was made worse when a leading officer of the marine corps made a statement on the 60 minutes program who said marine officers who are minorities do not shoot swim or use compasses as well as white officers the commandant later apologized for his remarks but it was a little too late and i am really happy to know that after all of the investigations that the secretary of the navy finally awarded mr yamashita his commission as an officer and a captain in the united states marine corps the tradition continues today of the thousands of asian pacific americans who served in the armed services retired general eric shinseki was the first asian pacific american fourstar general who served as unitedstates army chief of staff our asian american pacific island soldiers are fighting for freedom in iraq even as i speak just this past weekend i was privileged to witness in germany the swearing in of a samoan soldier by the name of command sergeant major iuniasolua savusa as the command sergeant major for unitedstates army europe and the 7th army i am very proud of command sergeant major savusa for his accomplishments he is an inspiration and a great role model for our youth and other asian pacific americans who currently serve in the military i think at this point i want to defer to my good friend the gentleman from california the manager of this special order this evening and i am sure that he may want to continue portions of his statement as well"], [0.0009551644325256348, 0.9990448355674744, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman from washington for yielding me the customary 30 minutes i yield myself 5 minutes democrats have been saying again and again and again and again the american people want and deserve a clean upordown vote on raising the minimum wage and this rule does not provide for such a vote minimumwage workers want and deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that today so i urge my colleagues to reject this rule i reserve the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9985476136207581, 0.9985476136207581, 0, "advocates for more

little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these people are goingto qualify for assistance i yield to the gentleman from florida"],

developing a strategic plan and framework for use of funding infrastructure tools and other resources eliminating cancer suffering and death is a true possibility americans have already received the

detected early including cervix breast colon and prostrate cancer and today 3 out of 4 children with cancer are cured the resolution that we are discussing today expresses congresss support of ending

tothe bill in the senate as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i cannot support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans i believe that the second amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majority in the senate i regret that under the guise of helping gun owners the house of representatives is today considering imposing new

united states of america under the stockholm or pops convention the rotterdam or pic convention and the aarhus pops protocol to the geneva lrtap convention this is solid public policy that i urge my colleagues to support because it reasonably implements the pops and pic conventions and the lrtap protocol w v pso 4 years and evcn as recently as a few months ago i have heard people ask ssional record extensions many questions about this bill why is it necessary for this legislation to become law if the united states is already attending these meetings isnt that enoughwhy do we need to move on this bill what does being a full partner mean to these agreements and what does it give the united states government and its people in terms of rights and opportunities that we do not already have these are all good questions but persistent repetition of these inquiries shows a fatal misunderstanding of these agreements and exactly why it is in the interest of the united states to become a party with full rights under these accords at a minimum the failure of congress to pass implementing legislationthus securing senate ratification of these treatiesleaves the united states government in the position of defending its interests and sharing its expertise only when other countries welcome it not when we wish and need for our own national purposes to offer it the unitedstates environmental protection agency has testified before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on environment and hazardous materials that it has been forced to wait long periods of time to be recognized because the leaders of the treatyrelated meetings did not consider our delegation important enough to be recognized sooner this situation presents a radical departure from the leadership role our country took in building the consensus for these pacts to exist our delegations should not be welcomed at the receptions for these international meetings but barred from being integral players in the technological discussions and final decisionmaking processes in these treaties failure to support this legislation is a clear signal that congress misunderstands the sophistication of our nations chemical knowledge base and regulatory experience and instead wishes the united states to cede its traditional leadership role in international toxic chemicals management in 2001 the bush administration pledged the commitment of the united states of america to join the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants that date marked the culmination of 10 years of bipartisan cooperation and leadership concerning global protection of the environment and public health these efforts included not just pops but the aarhus protocol on long range transboundary air pollution lrtap of pops and the rotterdam convention on prior informed consent pic these were not the triumphs of republican or democrat white houses they were the victories premised on the various needs and hopes of all americans sadly the benefits of these agreements have not been actualized because of the policy and political agendas of the interested stakeholders as they relate to chemical management it is unacceptable that those private parties that are subsets of the interests in our country whether they are businesses or nonprofits have as much if not more input than our own government officials at these meetings we must put these matters behind us and focus solely on making the unitedstates a full partner before i go into the specifics of this legislation and address some of its broader themes i want to briefly further explain why this legislation is being introduced and why it is different from my bill h r 4591 which also wold totally implement and make the united states a full partner in these agreements of remarks december 8 2006 first this bill is being introduced as a consensus position of the majority of stakeholders who have testified before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on environment and hazardous materials that they want the united states to pass implementing legislation second this legislation is different from h r 4591 as introduced because it represents a goodfaith compromise among members of congress who actively sought to sit down with me and work out mutually acceptable provisions i have always been willing to work with any member of congress on compromise provisions despite the fact that some members delay in getting back to me on whether they wanted to work out a compromise made enactment of this legislation nearly impossible finally this legislation is a collaborative work of elected officials with input from others some people think that this kind of legislation needs to be delegated to interest groups to forge not only am i dubious about punting our constitutional responsibility to legislate to unelected persons but history has shown that the same people who have called for a consensus stakeholder process have twice killed the resulting bills regarding the specifics of this bill first this bill is a targeted legislative fix that fills the existing legal gaps and only does what is important for us to become a full partner in these agreements it does not repeal any part of federal environmental law but rather adds a new section to the toxic substances control act to ban the manufacture processing distribution in commerce use and disposal of agreed upon pops and lrtap pops chemical substances and mixtures this new section also grants separate new authority for the united states to enact new regulations for future additions of pops chemical substances or mixtures to the stockholm convention or lrtap pops protocol because there has been concern from a number of persons about the difficulty existing tsca provisions present in the way of regulating existing chemicals this bill creates a distinct and different process within tsca that couples similary rigorous and sound scientific analyses but with a more deferential regulatory standard and the elimination of procedural hurdles that many argue have hindered epa from taking action regarding chemical protection this is not the tsca overhaul that many critics of the chemical manufacturing world have wanted but it is a solid middle ground that relies on science rather than emotion to address these very insidious chemicals while also keeping these treaties out of governing american manufacturing processes and decisions in addition while many political opponents of past pops legislative efforts have argued that the language in this legislation makes regulation of pops more difficult and places profits of chemical companies over the protection of human health a reading of the plain language of this legislation would prove how wrong and intentionally inflammatory they are to insist on this interpretation specifically this legislation sets its regulatory standard at protecting human health and the environment and intends that while exercising this legal authority the epa administrator in choosing the means to provide that protection is to balance costs and benefits in other words costs and benefits are to be taken into consideration in determining how to regulate a substance not whether to regulate a substance december 8 2006 congre lastly on this point and to further buttress the point that this bill is a deliberately different way of handling chemicals than the way they are now treated under existing federal environmental law the sponsors of this bill and i recognize that implementation legislation for these international agreements is a distinct context in which to amend unitedstates law recognizing that the underlying statutes being amended address the very broad and p9werful reach of the federal government into unitedstates manufacturing this legislation is solely intended to allow the united states to be able to participate fully in these agreements to the extent that it wishes the sponsors and i do not intend for the regulatory standards outlined in this bill whether singularly or as a package to be a blanket precedent for other environmental legislation future congresses should be very careful in assessing the environmental public health and other social and economic needs of the country before copying this standard because of the unique circumstances and purposes to which this legislation is tied second consistent with the structures and rules of the pops convention ihis legislation places unitedstates officials laws and standardsnot those of an unelected and unaccountable international bodyin charge of determining what specific control measures the united states should take treatiesjust like allieschange and it is hard to predict their future as the newly elected vice president of the nato parliamentary assembly i see countries use environmental and safety laws as nontariff trade barriers in fact we need not look any further than the world trade organization case involving genetically modified organisms or gmo crops for an example of how the european union tried to use its laws to bar market access for our farmers i believe it is reasonable to suggest that in the same way that environmental and labor groups argued that added environment and labor considerations must not be divorced from trade agreements such as nafta and gatt you also cannot ignore that economic and labor issues need to play a role when countries enact environmental laws a minority of stakeholders in this country are unhappy with the chemicals policy of the present administration and support using a legal standard in this country that flows straight from these treaties and has the control measures also directed by the international treaty parties not the united states this type of effort not only removes the executive branch from involvementthe state department has testified in opposition to this type of regimebut also the legislative branch from the process of considering the impact on unitedstates interests and laws ultimately in this construct the judicial branch becomes the sole arbiter of rights and interpreter of obligations under these agreementsa place the framers of the unitedstates constitution never intended in addition these same persons want to use a judicial review standard that merely ratifies rather than questions the regulatory decisions of the executive branch this circular argument on their part not only diminishes judicial reviewwhich their proposals pose as the supreme avenue to set and resolve policybut further reinforces a desire to have unitedstates environmental and manufacturing policy set in foreign capitals the legislation i am introducing today rightfully recognizes that these agreements will ssional record extensions of remarks be law long after the current president is out of office and congress should not and cannot pass reactionary legislation simply to hem in one leader it is our obligation to pass the best legislation that will serve our country and its interests under every leader this bill does that third the public should be fully informed about actions being taken under these agreements and congress should be informed when conflicts with existing environmental statutes occur neither the public nor congress should be prevented from providing input to our government about structures that are going to affect our lives simply because it is inconvenient history will show that cooperation between parties has allowed our treaties to function more successfully than when either congress or the public is cut out this contains public notice and comment throughout th6 entire treaty process including the regulation of chemicals as part or our countrys desire to optin fourth this legislation preserves the existing public petition process under the administrative procedure act and provides certainty to all americans as to what rights and obligations they would have we must not forget that we have both a mature chemical industry and a wellestablished set of legal nghts and responsibilities that are the envy of most countries this bill draws onnot adds tothe wellfounded petition processes in all environmental laws and maintainsunamendedthe current federalstate dynamic in all environmental laws most importantly nothing in this bill affects any other environmental statute or state delegated programs under those other statutes or any other environmental board constituted outside of tsca fifth sound objective peerreviewed science should be at the core of any decisions made by the united states under these treaties i believe we need to focus our finite resources on the most pressing problems not disproportionately or fully on every problem we face without regard to context currently an assessment of risks and effects is called for in other environmental statutes and is not unprecedented in addition the legislation being introduced today amends a provision contained in section 2 of h r 4591 that created a new tsca section 503 e 4 that relied on a determination by the epa administrator of the weight of the evidence when making a regulatory determination regarding restrictions on newly added pops chemicals it requires the epa administrator to use sound and objective scientific practices the best available science and to describe in the rulemaking record the quality of the scientific information on which the administrator based a decision to take action against a pops or lratp pops chemical substance or mixture sixth this legislation alters no existing rights and responsibilities of the states under federal chemicals laws first every right obligation and opportunity of the states that exists under tsca are still available to the states some including several democrat state attorneys general who were up for reelection have argued that states would be precluded from legislating or litigating around the federal government in a way that they can do now nothing could be further from the truth second even if one were to accept the argument that states should be able to act any way they e2205 want we should not forget that this is a treaty and that states should not unwittingly put the united states out of compliance with its obligations under these agreements through their own enactments and the state department has written to me that we should not allow that to happen finally to clarify concerns raised about potential preemotion possibilities in the face of longstanding state department practicethat the united states not agree to new treaty obligations unless our country has the legal authorities in place to comply with those obligations section 6 e of this legislation provides that any federal preemption of state laws cannot occur unless a rule or order implementing our obligation has been issued under this act and has gone final or become effective concurrently section 2 of this bill requires in new tsca section 506 that no regulation issued under this authority can become effective unless the united states consents to be bound to a treaty obligation regarding that chemical substance or mixture seventh and finally while this legislation is careful to ensure that only unitedstates officials are the drivers of decisions affecting our nation and its citizensa feature expressly guaranteed by these treatiesi also want to point out that this legislation also recognizes the global nature of this treaty and the important contributions that other countries may make to inform our decisions section 2 of this legislation establishes a new tsca section 503 e 2 b that allows the epa administrator to use internationally generated information or scientific studies so long as they meet the scientific soundness and objectivity criteria in this legislation in assessing the statutory considerations regarding the domestic regulation of a new pops or lrtap pops chemical substance or mixture furthermore new tsca section 503 e 2 v of section 2 requires domestic consideration of national ahd international consequences that are likely to arise as a result of domestic regulatory action including the possible consequences of using alternative products or processes in doing so this provisions use of the word consequences is not meant to automatically imply negative connotations but rather that the epa administrator is to look at the national and international positive and negative benefits that would flow from domestic regulatory action that being said the inclusion of this provision is in no way meant to give new legal rights or standing to foreignbased entities in unitedstates courts regarding unitedstates domestic regulatory actions under this legislation or the international environmental accords that this legislation implements this legislation is a true compromise that represents the middle ground on treaty implementation legislation and a place where most americans believe our policy should be if the united states is to remain a leader in the global environmental debate it must have legislation that fully implements these treaties the time has come for us to make a difference in global environmental protection from the most toxic of chemical substances and mixtures i urge congress to pass this legislation as soon as is practicable and make a strong statement of our national resolve to tackle these matters rather than place mere words behind our commitments"], [0.996398706221953, 0.0036012937780469656, 1, "fornia i

political association and 118 citizens signed a manifesto on democracy and freedom for vietnam but the government crackdown began almost immediately with raids detainments harassment and abuse those who signed these documents placed themselves and their families and their friends at a great risk for a greater good what a compelling reminder that while the freedoms we enjoy are not universal the

parents know we have an enormous obligation not only to ensure that our children receive an education which will enable them to function in this century but that their education include an important quotient of understanding other religions and other cultures and an education that resists the temptation to demonize those that we do not understand the government of saudi arabia has singularly failed to accomplish this important task the extremist wahhabi religious education which is present in saudi schools encourages and promotes extremism viciously antiamerican antiwestern and antisemitic attitudes it fosters hatred and intolerance it is no surprise that 15 of the 19 hijackers on september 11 were saudi nationals the vile hatred filling the minds of so many young saudis in

memorialize the 6 million jews who were murdered by the nazis during world war ii the world is still feeling the holocausts effects in 1933 there were over 9 million european jews by 1945 nearly two of every three had been killed as part of the nazis final solution european cities have never recovered the diversity and way of life they had prior to the war the jewish people killed were teachers lawyers doctors musicians parents and children and were killed only because they were jewish and targeted for no other reason we must also remember the others who were murdered gypsies the handicapped and poles were also targeted for destruction or decimation for racial ethnic or national reasons millions more including homosexuals jehovahs witnesses soviet prisoners of war and political dissidents also suffered grievous oppression and death under nazi tyranny for no specific reason except they were different than their captors as time moves forward there are few holocaust survivors still with us and it is important for them to share thei stories and educate people about their experiences nearly 60 years have passed since the holocaust but antisemitism still exists however i believe passing on the lessons learned from this horrible time from generation to generation will someday destroy the hateful attitudes and ignorance that resulted in the evil of the holocaust the holocaust was not an accident it was a planned attempted extermination individuals organizations and governments made choices that not 6nly legalized discrimination but also allowed prejudice hatred and ultimately mass murder to occur the human race must constantly be reminded of the holocaust and how the world stood idly by for too long we must remember these painful events in order to prevent another holocaust

the support of both the chairmen and the ranking members and staff of the resources committee and the subcommittee i rise in support of this legislation that i have offered on behalf of the city of austin in addressing the growing water needs that we have in central texas in a fiscally and environmentally responsible way this particular project deals with the design planning and construction of a project to use wastewater and reclaim it in our community the bureau of reclamation was originally authorized to get involved with such projects in 1992 and this bill adds austin to the list of eligible projects under what is known as title 16 the bill will help the city with federal funds to supplement what austin is already doing locally to expand our water reclamation facilities under title 16 federal participation is limited and the city will remain responsible for at least threefourths of the cost of the project reclaimed water or treated wastewater is generally used when highquality drinkable water is not required such as for irrigation industrial cooling towers and for various manufacturing purposes for more than 20 years the city of austin has operated its own water reclamation project for irrigation and to supply the composting operations at the hornsby bend plant on the colorado river in texas although we have some mighty powerful rivers we also have a mighty thirsty state i believe that by conserving the many resources with which we have been blessed in central texas we can ensure an ample water supply for the indefinite future this reclamation initiative will reduce the demand on austins existing water supply and conserve highquality water from the colorado river for human consumption austins existing reclaimed water system consists of 16 miles of pipe 1 5 million gallons of storage in 2 tanks 3 pump stations and 2 pressure zones we envision a muchexpanded system under the master plan we will reclaim water through 123 miles of pipe 17 million gallons of storage and multiple pump statio s and pressure zones for the system o grow from its existing limited capacity to its ultimate size will take about 200 million in additional infrastructure over the coming years when completed the expanded system authorized by this bill could eventually save as much as 9 billion gallons of water every year austin is already a national leader in planning for a sustainable future that improves our quality of life boosts economic development and protects the environment water conservation is a key part of that plan and a critical issue for a growing economy in an environmentallyminded city even with active water conservation programs the maximum daily demand for water in austin increased by 43 percent during the 1990s austin recognizes that aggressive conservation efforts can meet about half of our future shortfall but expanding our reclamation capabilities can get us the rest of the way there ben franklin once said when the well is dry we know the worth of water well this bill demonstrates that austinites know the worth of water before our source ot water goes dry and we are taking steps toensure water for our future the city and the bureau of reclamation have already advanced the project by completing a favorable appraisal report and beginning a feasibility study the appraisal report concluded that the citys projected water shortage can be eliminated by more aggressive water reclamation and that there is a federal interest in pursuing water reclamation and reuse investigations in austin in 1907 theodore roosevelt said the conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem unless we solve that problem it will avail us little to solve all others with your help the capital of the lone star state can make even more significant strides in managing its water resources i urge approval of this legislation"]]}
