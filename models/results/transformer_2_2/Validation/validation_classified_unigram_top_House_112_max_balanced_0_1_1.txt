from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american value i urge my colleagues to reject this ruse to reject the reconciliation process and to work toward a comprehensive and responsible and bipartisan deficit agreement reflective of our nations values"],

to the republicans well whats your plan your plan just seems to be saying to grandma and grandpa that theyre taking too much that they reallytheyre taking america for a ride and we have to cut medicare their health care is too good and grandma and grandpa they didnt do enough for america so the democrats we turn around and say hey how about looking at it this way how about before you go after grandma and her medicare card and how about you say to warren buffet hey how about not taking those extra tax breaks and the republicans say we cant take away any tax breaks from warren buffet and all of the other multimultimillionaires and billionaires because theyve contributed so much to america we dont want to touch their money even though that would give us hundreds of billions of dollars and then we say to them well how about prescription drugs how about we negotiate the price for prescription drugs for medicare the way we do with the va that would save about a quarter of a trillion dollars over a 10year period they say that would be unfair to the drug companies we cant touch them either then we say to them well you know the war in iraq the war in afghanistan its winding down now maybe we could look into the defense budget and save a few billion dollars there before we ask grandma to sacrifice on the health care that she gets from medicare and the republicans say we cant do that either we cant look at any cuts in the defense budget that would be much too hard on those defense contractors so then we say to them how about the oil industry at least the oil industry the 40 billion in tax breaks which theyre going to get over the next 10 years i mean does anyone in america really believe that they need tax breaks in order to have an incentive to go out and drill for oil when people are paying 3 3 50 4 a gallon at the pump but the republicans say no you cant touch the oil companies either youve got to give big tax breaks to the oil industry as well even as theyre tipping grandma and grandpa upside down at the pump when theyre coming in to put in their unleaded 4 a gallon gasolineselfserve by the wayat the pump so what do they do instead what they do is they put an oil rig on top of the medicare card so that the oil industry can drill into grandmas medicare and pull out the funding in order to provide the tax breaks for big oil for warren buffet for the prescription drug industry for the wars in iraq and afghanistan its all off of grandma shes the one weve targeted the person responsible for all of the wasteful spending in the united states its all grandmas fault lets cut medicare she didnt do enough to build our country through the 1930s the 1940s the 1950s and the 1960s its all on grandma so this drill rig that they are building into the pocketbooks of grandma in order to find that funding thats what their plan is all about its an oil pipeline into the pocketbooks of the seniors they want to cut checkups for grandma while they cut checks for the oil companies they want to cut health care to grandma and give wealth care to big oil companies and to billionaires and to prescription drug companies their plan is big tax breaks for big oil and tough breaks for grandma and for the seniors in our country and the ceo of chevron he says its unamerican to think about increasing taxes on the oil industry you know what i say to him its unbelievable that you could make that argument but even more unbelievable that the republican party would accept that argument and cut medicare for grandma to privatize it to hand it over to the insurance industry to increase the cost by 6 000 per year for their costs even as they say to warren buffet the oil companies the big drug companies the arms contractors dont worry were going to protect your programs its just grandma thats on the cutting block so ladies and gentlemen this is a debate of historical dimensions and until the republicans come forward with a planwhich they dont have in order to make medicare solventby raising the revenues out of these other areas from millionaires from the oil industry and from others do not expect us to say to grandma its her fault its not her fault she built this country she deserves this benefit and we should not be cutting it this republican plan to end medicare is just something that wants to turn it over to the insurance industry

amendment and work with those of us who are interested in healthy food my amendment would fund and seek to have the secretary of agriculture focus on the healthy food funding initiative this initiative would increase the availability of affordable healthy foods in underserved urban and rural areas and as well particularly through the development or equipping of grocery stores and other healthy food retailers we call these food deserts and the reason why i am standing next to this tragic picture of the disasters that have hit the american public is to emphasize what americans go through in this instance we see a disaster of unbelievable proportion from missouri to alabama to the flooding that occurred up and down the mississippi i can assure you that these individuals are suffering from the lack of access to healthy food weve got to get them back on their feet this idea of food deserts impacts rural and urban areas but it also impacts the millions of americans thousands upon thousands of americans who have recently been impacted by disaster everything is gone and although they are now probably experiencing the distribution of food from food centers sponsored by fema and volunteers they will come back to a food desert particularly in the african american and hispanic communities for example food comes from fast foods and convenience stores and as i indicated before those fast foods come from if you will the places where the expiration dates are sometimes way over the time of expiration according to the centers for disease control and prevention 80 percent of black women and 67 percent of black men are overweight african american children from lowincome families are at a much higher risk for obesity why because there is no access or limited access to good food the cdc also estimates that african american and mexican american adolescents ages 12 to 19 are more likely to be overweight at 21 percent and 23 percent respectively this amount of money will allow us to focus on the importance of correcting food deserts the unitedstates department of agriculture identified 92 food desert census tracks in harris county alone and that is in the 18th congressional district these areas are subdivisions of a county with between 1 000 to 8 000 lowincome residents with 33 percent of the people living more than a mile from a grocery store according to the kaiser family foundation 32 percent of all children in texas are overweight or obese these statistics underscore the staggering effect food deserts have i am asking that we look at the idea of ensuring healthy food targeting federal financial assistance to food desert areas through the healthy food finance initiative will provide more healthy food to affected areas we can create jobs we can help farmers and we can bolster the development in distressed areas it is an easy fix and the fix is to find a way to cooperate collaboratenot do a handout not dole outto make sure that we provide the incentives to come into our areas to ensure that we have a healthy child this is a healthy child we hope getting access to health care but i can assure you that their health is based upon not only health care but the food that this little one will eat i can tell you that i represent communities that have the inability to access good food this initiative will increase the availability of healthy food alternatives to the 23 5 million people living in food deserts nationwide we must be reducing the deficit i agree but cutting programs that provide healthy foodand create jobs because it would certainly create jobs by adding access to healthy food and sites for healthy food meaning grocery stores farmers markets all of those will be part of this initiative and it would assist the many many census tracks in houston alone that are now suffering from the lack of access to good food just a picture of green vegetables inspires us to support this amendment i would ask my colleagues to support this amendment i thank the chairman for this opportunity to explain my amendment to h r 2122 which allocates an additional 25 million to the budget of the office of the secretary in order to fund president obamas healthy food funding initiative hffi funding hffi will increase the availability of affordable healthy foods in underserved urban and rural communities particularly through the development or equipping of grocery stores and other healthy food retailers these food deserts communities in which residents do not have access to affordable and healthy food options disproportionally affect african american and hispanic communities fast food restaurants and convenience stores line the blocks of low income neighborhoods offering few if any healthy options many of my colleagues across the aisle have made arguments about the economic climate and the need for budgetary cuts and i agree that we must work to reduce the deficit we cannot however continue to make irresponsible cuts to programs for the underserved lower income families and minorities since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children and obesity is a grave health concern for all americans however food deserts have taken a toll on low income and minority communities and exacerbated growing obesity rates and health problems according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 80 percent of black women and 67 percent of black men are overweight or obese african american children from low income families have a much higher risk for obesity than those in higher income families the cdc also estimates african american and mexican american adolescents ages 1219 are more likely to be overweight at 21 percent and 23 percent respectively than nonhispanic white adolescents who are 14 percent overweight in children 611 years old 22 percent of mexican american children are overweight compared to 20 percent of african american children and 14 percent of nonhispanic white children food deserts have greatly impacted my constituents in the 18th congressional district and citizens throughout the state of texas texas has fewer grocery stores per capita than any other state the unitedstates department of agriculture usda identified 92 food desert census tracts in harris county alone these areas are subdivisions of the county with between 1 000 to 8 000 lowincome residents with 33 percent of people living more than a mile from a grocery store according to the kaiser family foundation 32 percent of all children in texas are overweight or obese these statistics underscore the staggering effect food deserts have on the health of lowincome and minority communities in houston and other cities across the country local programs have proved that well targeted funding and assistance can create viable business outcomes and increase access to healthy food targeting federal financial assistance to food desert areas through the healthy food funding initiative will provide more healthy food to affected neighborhoods open new markets for farmers create jobs and bolster development in distressed communities the healthy food funding initiative is not a handout or a crutch funding through this program is intended to provide financial and technical assistance in support of market planning promotion efforts infrastructure and operational improvements and increase availability of locally and regionally produced foods this initiative will increase the availability of healthy food

democratic side of the budget committee to talk about choices you know government is all about choosing it is setting priorities and it is choosing what we are going to spend the peoples money for how much we are going to ask the people to pay to the government and how we are going to spend those dollars it is all about choosing it is also about values this week this issue of choices is playing itself out in two arenas in government one in the continuing resolution battle that took place on this floor this afternoon the idea that we have to figure out how to fund the government for the rest of this fiscal year ending september 30 and whether or not we are willing to let the government shut down tomorrow night because of the choices that we either make or refuse to make and it is also playing itself out now in the development of the budget for the following fiscal year yesterday in the budget committee we considered the budget proposal offered by chairman ryan and the republicans that offered some very stark choices for the american people they are similar to the choices that we have been debating week after week after week for the last couple of months about how we are going to fund the government for the rest of the year from the democratic perspective at least i know from my perspective the reason i have not been willing to support the republican versions of the continuing resolutions that have come to this floor is that they make choices which dont seem very fair to me they dont seem to represent the values that this country has always embraced the values of fairness and justice and the idea that we are all in this great journey together and that we are trying to create a country that works for everybody and not just for a very few today the republicans brought to the floor a continuing resolution to fund the government for one more week these are the choices they made as to what we should cut in order to avoid shutting the government down they wanted to eliminate 143 million for school lunch assistance programs 187 million for education for the disadvantaged programs school improvement funds education innovative improvement programs and adult education it cuts the wic program nutrition for lowincome families women and their children the office of national drug control policy they want to cut 495 million from femas first responder program all these things they wanted to cut and yet when you ask them whether they want to have other people the wealthiest people the big corporations the people who have done very well in this country over the last couple of decades if you ask them why dont we make them share some of the burden of balancing this budget they say oh no we cant do that we cant do that let me just illustrate with this chart one of the choices that they made in the 2012 budget proposal they chose to include refused to eliminate 800 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans and instead cut 771 billion from medicaid over the next 10 years this was a choice do we want to make sure that our senior citizens have access to nursing homes that our disabled population has access to assisted living facilities and home care our young lowincome poor families do we want to make sure that they have health care or do we want to make sure that the wealthiest 2 percent of americans continue to have their cake and eat it too their choice in the budget and in the continuing resolution is to let those wealthiest americans have their cake and eat it too and let the most vulnerable segments of society pay the price of helping to balance the budget i am a big fan of political cartoons and todays cartoon in the washington post i think said it all because one of the other proposals that the republicans made in their 2012 budget proposal was not just to maintain the tax breaks for the wealthiest americans but to increase them they want to cut the maximum tax rate from 35 percent which was the rate that it was cut to by the bush administration they wanted to cut it even further to 25 percent in other words a 10 percent additional tax cut for the wealthiest americans as a matter of fact i offered an amendment in the hearing to rescind the bush tax cut for only those people making over 1 million a year only those people making over 1 million a year they voted it down unanimously but here is the cartoon by tom toles in the washington post it has and i wont name him but a republican member of the budget committee offering a platter that says more tax cuts for wealthy and the truly rich guy says stop i cant eat another bite and the republican says sorry everybody has to share the pain this is one of the choices we have it is stark again tax cuts for the wealthiest americans or health care education nutrition for the other 90 percent of the american people who have not done so well so as we move through this process of choosing both how we are going to fund the government until september 30 and how were going to fund it into the future the american people need to know whose side the republican majority is on and whose side the democrats are on with that i yield to my

emergencies and 75 percent of these bankruptcies are of people who had health insurance but health insurance that proved inadequate to cover an expensive disease like cancer by preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions and by eliminating the annual and lifetime caps on coverage found in most current policies the affordable care act will guarantee that middle

doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of poverty no segment of the population is immune from this painful absurd republican planexcept maybe millionaires billionaires and wealthy corporations the republican proposal cuts meals on wheels and reduces food assistance for almost 2 million needy people one of the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and in addition to what i have already mentioned this thing that they are taking up in the house today cuts off almost 300 000 children from free school lunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops said the republican plan fails a basic moral test this budget sets very clear priorities the problem is what they are taking up in the house sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people a nation does not have to be cruel to be tough so republicans would do well to remember our nation is judged not only by the strength of its military but also by the strength of its values so says general eisenhower and president roosevelt"], [0.9939242005348206, 0.9939242005348206, 0, "i appreciate the gentlelady from texas offering this amendment and i want to restate what it attempts to do it will prohibit outsourcing of dod functions until the secretary of defense conducts an outreach program to benefit women and minorityowned small businesses well in fact it is a duplication of what is already in the law it duplicates section 891 of the fiscal year 2011 national defense authorization act which requires the establishment of an outreach program to firms near dod installations this act simply delays allowing for outsourcing to come back in and be part of the benefits that it provides to this nation reducing cost streamlining the process so again this is already in law as i said this is nothing more than a delay tactic to stop outsourcing we need to use outsourcing where it makes sense to utilize the benefits of reducing cost which has the potential to help our small businesses which i think we all support whether they are womenowned or minorityowned businesses small businesses are important and i think outsourcing does that in fact in my district letterkenny army depot has publicprivate partnerships today through outsourcing with small businesses and large alike the heritage foundation did a study commending what is going on at letterkenny army depot utilizing dod civilians as well as the private sector coming together where it makes sense where we can have a tremendously positive impact on the work that goes there so there is a model out there and outsourcing is important again i urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment because again it already is established in last years defense authorization bill exactly what

should we leave afghanistan i think the answer is very clear and its not complicated of course we should as soon as we can this suggests that we can leave by the end of the year if we dont well be there for another decade would be my prediction the american people are now with us a group of us here in the congress a bipartisan group for nearly a decade have been talking about this arguing not to expand the war not to be over there not to be in nation building and the american people didnt pay much attention now they are the large majority of the american people now say its time to get out of afghanistan its a fruitless venture too much has been lost the chance of winning since we dont even know what we are going to win doesnt exist so they are tired of it financially theres a good reason to come home as well some argue we have to be there because if we leave under these circumstances well lose face it will look embarrassing to leave so how many more men and women have to die how many more dollars have to be spent to save face that is one of the worst arguments possible we are not there under legal conditions this is a war who says it isnt a war everybody talks about the afghan war was the war declared of course not it wasnt declared there was a resolution passed that said that the president at that time under the emergency of 9 11 could go and deal with al qaeda those who brought upon the 9 11 bombings but al qaeda is not there anymore so we are fighting the taliban the taliban used to be our allies at one time when the soviets were there the talibans main goal is to keep the foreign occupation out they want foreigners out of their country they are not al qaeda yet most americansmaybe less so now but the argument here on the floor is we have got to go after al qaeda this is not a war against al qaeda if anything it gives the incentive for al qaeda to grow in numbers rather than dealing with them the money issue we are talking about a lot of money how much do we spend a year probably about 130 billion up to 1 trillion now in this past decade later on in the day we are going to have two votes we are going to have a vote on doing something sensible making sense out of our foreign policy bringing our troops home and saving hundreds of billions of dollars then we also will have a vote against npr to cut the funding of npr there is a serious question about whether that will even cut one penny but at least the fiscal conservatives are going to be overwhelmingly in support of slashing npr and then go home and brag about how they are such great fiscal conservatives and the very most they might save is 10 million and thats their claim to fame for slashing the budget at the same time they wont consider for a minute cutting a real significant amount of money all empires end for fiscal reasons because they spread themselves too far around the world and thats what we are facing we are in the midst of a military conflict that is contributing to this inevitable crisis and its financial and you would think there would be a message there how did the soviets come down by doing the very same thing that were doing perpetual occupation of a country we dont need to be occupying afghanistan or any other country we dont even need to be considering going into libya or anywhere else fortunately i guess for those of us who would like to see less of this killing we will have to quit because we wont be able to afford it the process that we are going through is following the war powers resolution this is a proper procedure it calls attention to how we slip into these wars i have always claimed that its the way we get into the wars that is the problem if we would be precise and only go to war with a declaration of war with the people behind us knowing who the enemy is and fight win and get it over with that would be more legitimate they dont do it now because the american people wouldnt support it nobody is going to declare war against afghanistan or iraq or libya we now have been so careless for the past 50 or 60 years that as a congress and especially as a house we have reneged on our responsibilities we have avoided our prerogatives of saying that we have the control we have control of the purse we have control of when we are supposed to go to war yet the wars continue they never stop and we are

today seeks to limit funding for the surface transportation inspection program at a hearing held by the transportation security subcommittee of homeland security of which i am a member industry witnesses raised serious concerns about the efficacy of the surface transportation inspection program here are some of the concerns raised at the hearing most surface inspectors have no surface transportation experience or surface security background whatsoever many surface inspectors were promoted from screening passengers at airports these inspectors report to the federal security directors at local airports who commonly also do not possess any surface transportation experience at least one local tsa official indicated he is always looking for things for his inspectors to do to occupy their time most surface inspectors have two things to look for in a typical day whether a transit system is reporting incidents to the tsa and a box is checked on their clipboard and whether there is a security person on duty another box to be checked on a clipboard the work of these inspectors is redundant performed by employees of other agencies such as the department of transportation osha or epa and on and on what they do is ultimately slow down commerce on our nations rails and highways since 2008 tsa has more than doubled the size of the transportation inspection workforce and quadrupled the programs budget yet according to the majority of stakeholders we heard from there has been almost no tangible improvement in security as a result of these investments last year tsas entire surface transportation security budget was 126 million of this amount surface inspectors cost taxpayers 54 million which does not even include headquarters administration oversight and staff associated with the program this means that the surface transportation inspection program which has been labeled as ineffective by a number of freight rail passenger service bus and mass transit agencies is consuming more than 40 percent of the entire surface transportation security budget millions of americans rely on surface transportation every day more than 8 million people use public transportation in new york city alone despite this need less than 2 percent of the tsas nearly 8 billion budget goes toward securing our nations surface transportation systems and a large portion of that limited budget is being squandered on this ineffective inspection program surface transportation security is too important to our national economy and receives too small a portion of homeland security funding to waste a single dollar opponents of this amendment may argue that it will result in federal inspectors being put out of work it will not we are transferring money to implement more productive security measures within tsa the question is simply why should taxpayers especially those who rely on surface transportation every day have to fund a program that has no proven ability to enhance security my amendment today seeks to limit the inspector program budget to 20 million which would substantially reduce its size and allow the saved money to be put forward in other more effective surface programs such as canine detection units particularly at bus and rail stations this amendment strengthens security it addresses concerns raised by the very transit systems the program is designed to protect today i ask you to join me in supporting this measure i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9891898715868592, 0.010810128413140774, 1, "staff was and appreciate the fact that they took me and part of my staff down there to see the way it is in arizona but here is a map of arizona and the portions of arizona where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans and thats just the way it is"], [0.9888982437551022, 0.011101756244897842, 1, "well again the rules committee found and i believe the parliamentarian advised that the

previous years and i know that he understands that this is not a republican or a democratic problem because the regulatory burdens on small businesses increased by 30 billion from the years 20012008 and federal regulations now cost americans 1 75 trillion each year which is up 50 percent from the 1 1 trillion in annual costs just in 2005 and last year the federal register contained 80 000 pages

real estate procedures at hud environmental regulations at the epa and on it goes so the reality is weve already done as a committee what this resolution calls for and i will include in the record the 112th congress small business committees oversight of federal regulatory and paperwork burdens administrative plan what the committee has already passed so my question for the gentleman from missouri to answer during the course of the debate is what exactly does this resolution do for small businesses that were not already doing is there anything in this thats not already being done now does it actually reduce any real regulatory burden on small businesses does it reduce paperwork does it limit government requirements on the small business community i would submit that this particular resolution does not it sets up a bureaucratic process here in the congress with a goal of inventory of regulations a long list of inventory regulations but this list will be submitted as part of an administrative reporting process it does nothing for small businesses so i would suggest in closing that instead of approving this bookkeeping resolution what congress really needs to do is strengthen the tools it already has available to reduce regulatory burdens this includes the regulatory flexibility act which mandates that federal agencies consider the potential economic impact of federal regulations strengthening the requirements and increasing agency reviews and regulations regulatory relief that we passed here in the congress during the 110th congress reported out by the small business committee related to bipartisan regulatory reductions and as we continue to revisit these issues here in the 112th congress we must remember that small businesses are who were trying to help so in closing im concerned that what this legislation does is add an unnecessary step to getting down to the business that we can all agree on which is actually reducing the regulations that we all agree are a problem"]], "top_unsure": [[0.000303804874420166, 0.5003038048744202, 0, "i rise today in support of h r 514 an extension of these provisions the most important job of the federal government is to protect our country and to protect its people my most important job in congress is to ensure that i am giving the law enforcement community within the bounds of the constitution the tools that they need to make sure that we stay secure to make sure that we stay protected that is what i consider the utmost call in members of congress and the utmost call in members in the military and the law enforcement community you are going to hear throughout this debate and you have already heard from so many people that have used these tools in the practice and in implementation in taking out terrorists and taking out organized crime units let me just say im an air force pilot i have been overseas and i understand the enemy that we face and the determination that they have to bring what we saw on 9 11 to bring that back to the shores of the united states i also understand that the only thing standing between another 9 11 and a peaceful country like we have been feeling for about the last 10 years is our law enforcement community and our united states military that makes it essential to listen to those individuals and understand what we need to ensure that we are bringing down terrorist cells where they exist in the united states and we are continuing to protect ourselves from infiltration overseas on the tragic day on 9 11 americans were united in our understanding that we must work together as a nation to defeat those who would destroy our way of life now it is essential that even though we havent been attacked that we understand that sometimes in the quiet lies the biggest threat and we never forget that this threat is very very real so i ask my colleagues to rise and join me i ask my colleagues to ask themselves which side do they want to be on do they want to be on the side that doesnt necessarily understand and recognize that we are going to continue to be assaulted for generations from a group overseas that wants to destroy and harm our way of life so i

amendment offered by my colleagues rep mccollum and rep kingston and let me say that while i wholeheartedly agree to the notion that this body must take the lead in putting our nation back on the path towards fiscal responsibility the move to prohibit our military services from advancing recruitment and retention goals through various athletic sponsorships is unwise at a time when the men and women of our armed forces are undertaking operations around the world we must not move to end the successful platforms used by the department of defense to recruit able men and women into their ranks contrary to popular belief these sponsorships also go far beyond driver appearances commercials and decals on race cars in fact the national guards sponsorship of the panther racing indycar team has not only been successful in raising the guards profile and getting it in front of potential recruits but also technology transfers between these entities will allow for our service members to be better protected when downrange j r hildebrand who drives the national guard indycar wears ear sensors that measure the gforces he experiences during a crash on the racetrack those sensors known as an integrated blast effects sensor system are now worn by troops in harms way the information gathered can be very useful to neurosurgeons who treat soldiers suffering from traumatic brain injury often the result of roadside bomb attacks understanding the nature and effects of traumatic brain injury advances the ways in which we protect and treat our fighting men and women and those same sensors worn by j r hildebrand have a direct benefit to our troops in afghanistan furthermore helmet technologies developed in indycar and the national football league have been adapted for military use and these represent just a few of the results from the militarys sponsorships or partnerships with professional sports as our service members return to civilian life they are often faced with a continuing unemployment crisis in partnership with the national guard panther racing continues to work with the employer support of the national guard esgr program an agency within the department of defense designed to connect citizen soldiers with employers panther racing continues to work with the chamber of commerce to support the hiring our heroes program at race events across the country the national guard partnership with panther racing brings military members and their spouses together with ceos of local businesses and ultimately helping get our nations veterans back to work utilizing military partnerships with professional sports can be a vital tool in improving the lives and care of our service men and women the results of these programs speak for themselves amendments similar to

giving me this time i thank my colleagues for listening and for joining me in a few minutes but i am also very sorry to be here in a certain respect im sorry because i stand here tonight to talk about threats to the right of american citizens in states across this great country to go to the polls and cast a ballot in our elections the single most fundamental aspect of our democracyor any democracyis the right to vote and that right is under attack there is no right mentioned more often in the constitution than the right to vote in the past 207 years we have amended the constitution 15 times seven of those amendmentsalmost half of the amendmentsover the last two centuries are about protecting in the words of the 14th amendment the right to vote minorities women adults over 18 years of age poor citizens and of course citizens of our nations capitalat least if only for the presidential electionall of these groups right to vote has been enshrined in our constitution thats why it is so troubling to see dozens of states passing laws that will make it harder for citizens of the united states to vote whether by denying them the opportunity to vote after church on sunday before the election dayperhaps because they cannot take time off work on election dayor requiring them to spend time and money to procure a birth certificate and a photo id the only thing that these laws will do is to weaken our democracy they are just plain wrong hopefully i will be joined by some of my colleagues but i do want to spend a little bit of time explaining to the american public and to my colleagues what this is all about and im going to start off by the photo id voter requirement which is being passed obviously out of the legislature in the state of texas and to be enacted for the 2012 election what is it exactly well people will say you mean you just have to have a photo id it is not just any photo id it has to be one that meets all the requirements of a particular states laws so you would say well how onerous could that possibly be as ive said it is not just any government issued photo id that will be accepted on election day it has certain requirements so much to my surprise i recently found out that basically my identification and my voting card that all members of congress use would not be sufficient would not meet the requirements in the great state of texas but it should not come as any surprise because if you are a veteran and you have a photo id that allows you to go to the audie murphy memorial veterans hospital in san antonio texas in my district that photo id will not suffice under texas law if youre a student in one of our statesupported institutions that has your photo on there has your name all that information that is not going to meet the requirements in the state of texas so you would ask why would we pass these laws what is the need what is the requirement because we all know whether youre in the state legislature or in this great house of representatives at the federal level we dont pass unnecessary laws so there must be a purpose behind these photo id laws as well as other laws that are restricting the rights of individuals to exercise the right to vote it is to stop fraud the photo id its whole purpose is to stop people from impersonating an eligible voter now you would say so that must be happening across this great country and thats why we need this law people are impersonating other people people that shouldnt be voting might be impersonating an eligible voter so lets discuss that the reason for the photo id in these many states im going to give you the example of the state of kansas the secretary of state pushed an id law on the basis of a list of 221 reported instances of voter fraud this all was supposed to have occurred in kansas since the year 1997 so from 1997 for about 13 years there were 221 reported instances of voter fraud when the newspaper the wichita eagle looked into the local cases cited by the secretary of state they found almost all of them were honest mistakes none were attempted to be perpetrated by someone impersonating someone who they were not a great example of that and i have to read you the excerpt from the wichita eagle of october 29 2010 republican kris kobach who has built his campaign for secretary of state around the issue of voter fraud raised the specter of the dead voting in kansas kobach said in a news conference thursday that 1 966 deceased people were registered to vote in kansas every one of those 1 966 identities is an opportunity for voter fraud waiting to happen he said furthermore he said some were still casting ballots he gave an example of one person alfred k brewer a republican registered in sedgwick county with a birth date listed of january 1 1900 brewer according to the comparison of social security records and kansas voter rolls had died in 1996 yet had voted in the august primary kobach said reached thursday at his home where he was raking leaves brewer 78 was surprised some people thought he was dead i dont think this is heaven not when im raking leaves he said those are example after example no one can give you a specific example of voter fraud based on someone impersonating someone who they should not be on election day now between the years 2002 and 2007 a major department of justice at the federal level of course had a probe into voter fraud the result was failure to prosecute a single person for going to the polls and impersonating an eligible voter zero prosecutions after tremendous amounts of manpower time energy and money nothing happened now the brandon center for justice the cases for voter fraud what is it so if you have a law that is addressing a particular offensivetype behavior that obviously hurts this great republic of ours such as voter fraud surely we must have demonstrated tangible verifiable cases out there the washington post in an editorial was looking at the number of alleged voter fraud and these are not all predicated on voter id it could be some other type of fraud thats being perpetrated but if you took all of the cases that have ever been alleged this is the percentage of the total votes cast of those that might be suspect because youve got to remember theres going to be a price were going to pay for this law and that is its going to disenfranchise the eligible voter in pursuit of the phantom illegal voter in missouri if you took all of their complaints it would amount to when compared to the total voter turnout 0 0003 percent in new york it would amount to 0 000009 percent in new jersey it would be 0 0002 percent so where is the voter fraud what are we trying to address in passing these laws by the different state legislatures we had a recent occurrence and this was not even a voter id case but this is where the secretary of state in colorado mr gessler was dropping voters from the voting list and not forwarding ballots for voting based on that particular voter not having voted in 2010 it didnt matter if they voted previously to that if they did not vote in 2010 then they were dropped from the rolls and what was the reason for that well theres potential voter fraud potential of fraud but they could notthat secretary of state when they finally went to court could not address could not demonstrate could not offer into evidence one case of voter fraud not one based on his suspicions or conjecture in 2006 in the great state of texas my home state the texas attorney general had a press release and it was entitled lets stamp out voter fraud in texas sounds good sounds like a good thing to do he could not name one not one single case of fraud that would have been stopped by a voter id law in the state of texas i
