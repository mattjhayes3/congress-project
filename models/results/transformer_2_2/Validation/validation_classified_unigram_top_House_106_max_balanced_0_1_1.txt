the budget for giving us this opportunity to face americans and define for them what kind of country we would like to be i had the pleasure of organizing the congressional childrens caucus a group of about 60 members who have committed to promoting children first in the national agenda we look forward to hearing from mrs tipper gore the wife of the vice president on the mdrch 25 1999 issues of mental health services for children keeping that in mind i am very concerned with the budget as proposed by the majority leadership because our children must face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millennium we have got to invest in children this budget does not children cannot learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending in programs aimed at protecting the interests of children allow me to call the roll a program of which many members of this house have testified that they graduated from head start is being cut 501 million a 10 percent cut the wic program that provides for women infants and children being cut 425 million job corps which has allowed many inner city and rural community youth to find an opportunity out of the seat of degradation cut 141 million child care there is not a time that i go home to my district when women and men parents who say give me the ability to work provide child care and help me provide child care for my children sometimes onethird of their income 119 million the summer youth program where a mother gave me the good news of her young person who had graduated through the summer youth program now gainfully employed cutsome 109 million community services block cut 54 million runaway and homeless youth which i confront all the time in our community cut 4 7 million native american head start cut 3 8 million child abuse 2 2 million abandoned infants assistance 1 3 million i can only say oppose this majority leadership budget realize that our children are our best investment let us support the democratic alternative and invest in our children i rise in opposition to fy 2000 budget resolution offered by the majoritys leadership i come in the spirit of hershey and bipartisanism i come to request a budget that protects the social security trust fund for americas citizens i rise to request a budget thact will protect the medicare trust fund we must authorize a budget that will protect the social security trust fund while women tend to collect benefits over a longer period than men because of a greater life expectancy women on average receive lower monthly social security benefits since they have lower earnings and are more likely to be widowed or unmarried in retirement the majoritys budget proposal does not protect women or children or the social security trust fund under this budget proposalprograms directed toward improving the quality of life for women and children are the first programs to be reduced and cut in order to give a tax break to the wealthy the majority is suggesting that their budget proposal will save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment and to modernize public schools educating americas children should be our number one priority our children must be prepared to face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millenium children can not learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending and programs aimed at protecting the interest of our children 425 1 million would be slashed from the wic budget head start would becut by approximately 501 4 million ard liheap funding would be reduced by 109 million nevertheless the majoritys budget resolution reserves 800 billion for tax cuts we must authorize a budget that will protect and extend the medicare trust fund this budget must ensure that patients will have access to high quality healthcare by guaranteeing important protections such as access to the specialists coverage for emergency medical services and affording prescriptions for seniors the majoritys budget proposal leaves the medicare trust fund in a precarious position and its future in question the congressional budget

of the most vulnerable members of our community our seniors americans widely support programs to ensure the health and welfare of older americans we have social security we have medicare as well as housing programs nutrition programs and programs that really protect our lowincome seniors seniors today have less fear of being taken advantage of because of consumer laws and senior abuse laws that protect them but there is one area where we clearly have failed and that is to ensure that prescription drugs are affordable affordable to the people who need them the most our seniors the latest surveys indicate that 86 percent of medicare beneficiaries take prescription drugs and that the elderly in the united states who make up only 12 percent of our population use onethird of the prescription drugs sold in this nation the need for prescription drugs to treat such diseases as arthritis diabetes high blood pressure heart disease is simply a fact of life for seniors or a fact of death a few years ago a survey of seniors reported that 13 percent of older americans had to choose between eating or buying medicine in sonoma and main counties the district i represent the two counties north of the golden gate bridge two individuals that i have come to know roy and ivera cobbs of sebastopol have had to make some very difficult decisions around their prescription drugs what thley decided was she would take her prescription drugs and he would not because they could not afford both that is not the way we are supposed to be treating our seniors also in sonoma and matin county the area agencies on aging and green thumb have told me some other stories they tell me about cases where seniors just do not buy food because they have to have prescription drugs or they take part of their prescription every other day instead of every day or once a day instead of twice a day as prescribed by their doctors because they cannot afford to pay for the whole dosage and for the reason some seniors cannot pay for them keeps our seniors from having the best health care they can this reason i believe is solely on the shoulders of the nations largest drug companies because they engage in discriminatory pricing if you are a favored customer like an hmo like a large insurance company you pay less much less for prescription drugs but if you are an older person on medicare you pay a premium price for your drugs in the district i represent sonoma county seniors pay on the average of 145 percent more for the most commonly used drugs than favored customers pay for the same drugs for one drug they pay 242 percent more than favored customers i know this because i asked the minority staff of the committee on government reform to look into prescription drug pricing in sonoma and matin counties i released the results to that report to my community and its central conclusion can be summed up in the report subtitle drug companies profit at the expense of older americans as members can see by these charts for sonoma county alone the study looked into five commonly used prescription drugs charted their price at local pharmacies and compared those prices to what the federal government pays for the same drugs the federal negotiated price is nearly the same you must know as that charged to favored private customers large insurance companies and hmos senior citizens and other individuals who pay for their own drugs pay more than twice as much for these drugs than do the drug companies most favored customers for some drugs listed in the report the price is even more outrageous synthroid for example a hormone treatment costs sonoma county seniors 1 738 percent more than it cost the manufacturers favored customers by looking at these charts we can see that for medicare patients those who need the cholesterol drug zocor their costs are significantly greater than the favored customers this comes out to 115 for medicare patients and 34 for the favored customers that is 231 percent different the difference is not in price because the hmos the large insurance companies and government buyers are able to negotiate and buy in bulk the difference is because they are charging seniors to make up the difference for what they cut for their most favored customers"], [0.0013551115989685059, 0.9986448884010315, 1, "here in congress we say we stand together and in our commitment toward the spread of democratic ideals and improvement of the human rights these last couple weeks i am not so sure during the weeks approaching the vote for permanent

consumers in china what they do not say is that their real interest is in 1 2 billion chinese workers workers whom they pay wage on the level of slave labor these ceos will tell us increase trade with china will allow human rights to improve democracy will flourish with increased free trade as we engage with china but as these ceos speak their companies systematically violate the most fundamental of human and worker rights in the new report made in china the role of unitedstates companies in denying human and worker rights released by charles kernaghan and the national labor committee we see evidence of american corporations exploiting the horrible conditions of human rights in the peoples republic of china companies such as huffy and nike and walmart are contracting with chinese sweatshops to export to the united states often with the assistance of repressive and corrupt local government authorities 1 800 huffy bicycle workers have lost their jobs in ohio as huffy shut down its last three remaining unitedstates plants over the last 17 months in july of 1998 huffy fired 850 workers from its celina ohio plant where workers earned 17 an hour huffy now outsources all of its production to developing nations such as china where laborers are forced to work 15 hours a day 7 days a week and earn an average of 33 cents an hour less than 2 percent of what ohio huffy bicycle workers earned walmart makes its line of kathie lee gifford handbags in china there are a thousand workers at the factory where they put in 14hour shifts 7 days a week 29 or 30 days a month one off

indentured servants to kathie lee and to walmart some would simply call it slavery the findings in charles kernaghans report illustrates why democratic countries in the developing world are losing ground to more authoritarian countries in the developing world democratic nations such as india are losing out to more totalitarian governments such as china democratic nations such as taiwan are losing out to more authoritarian governments such as indonesia where people are not free and workers do as their told the share of developing country exports to the unitedstates from democratic nations fell from 53 percent 10 years ago to 35 percent today corporate america wants to do business with countries with docile workforces that earn belowpoverty wages and are not allowed to organize to bargain collectively in manufactured goods developing democracies share of developing country exports fell 21 percent from 56 to 35 percent corporations are relocating their manuficturing bases to more authoritarian regimes from democratic countries where workers do not talk back for fear of being punished western corporations want to invest in countries that have poor environmental standards no worker benefits belowpoverty wages no opportunities to bargain collectively and worse as developing countries make progress toward democracy as they increase worker rights and create regulations to protect the environment the american business community punishes them by pulling its trade and investment from developing democratic countries to totalitarian governments and developing countries

want to empower workers does the chinese communist worker want the chinese people to enjoy human rights i do not think so does the peoples liberation army want to close the labor camps i do not think so do western investors want chinese workers to make better wages have more democracy and bargain collectively i do not think so none of these groups has any interest in changing the status quo in

member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims i am mostly concerned about the latino immigration fairness act lifa the phrase compassionate conservatism has very hollow meaning if you just talk the talk and not walk the walk this lifa proposal is the modern day civil rights issue of our time and just 12 days to election day the republicans are thumbing their noses at immigrants who have contributed to our society and are trying to play by the rules i say not deal to this proposal and i urge a no vote this involves amnesty for immigrants who have paid their dues and have been in this country since 1986 parity for liberians guatemanlans haitains and hondurans and restoring section 245 i which allows immigrants to adjust their illegal status pay a fee and remain in this country with their spouses and children these are reasonable proposals and the republican leadership has a blind eye for fairness for justice and equity the republican proposal to provide relief to only 400 000 immigrants who were unable to take advantage of the 1986 law for those entering the country before 1982 is unacceptable it is unacceptable because it leaves and locks too many people out this is a proposal that is thinly veiled as an open door but it really is a feeble attempt to play up to the hispanic vote during the political season the republican legislation is a piecemeal correction of the flawed implementation of the 1986 legalization program basically those individuals who sought the counsel of a specific lawyer and filed suit with him are protected while countless others are left out of those people who are covered in the flawed proposal less than 40 are expected to prevail if the gop acknowledges that the 1986 law was not implemented correctly they should try to right the wrong entirely not pick some winners and losers based on what law firm they signed up to represent them also it is important to understand that this amnesty program in fact is just a long overdue update in the registry provision of the immigration and nationality act the registry provision gives immigrants who have been here without proper documents an opportunity to adjust to permanent status if they have been here for a long enough time and have nothing in their background that would disqualify them from immigrant status the legislation would just update the cutoff date for registry which is now set at 1972 then there is juan gonzalez who has been working for a construction company in houston texas for more than 13 years recently he lost his job because he was not able to present his employer a renewed employment authorization since then his family is living a nightmare juan and his wife luisa are having problems and close to a divorce they lost their home and rented a 2bedroom apartment unfortunately their children are paying the consequences we also need to remain ever vigilant on nacara parity this would address an injustice in the provisions of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of 1997 nacara nacara currently provides qualified cubans and nicaraguans an opportunity to become lawful permanent residents of the united states the proposed legislation would extend the same benefits to eligible nationals of guatemala el salvador honduras and haiti the bill that the republicans have brought to the floor has completely left nacara parity out i say no deal and a no vote like nicaraguans and cubans many salvadorans guatemalans hondurans and haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable political and economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s the united states has a strong foreign policy interest in providing the same treatment to these similarly situated people in addition returning migrants to these countries would place significant demands on their fragile economic and political systems like senator jack reed i have worked very hard to ensure that the 10 000 liberian nationals who have been living in the united states since the mid1980s and have significantly contributed to the american economy are not deported this legislation should also include these liberian nations if the latino immigrant fairness act is not enacted hundreds of thousands of people will be forced to abandon their homes will have to separate from their families and return to countries where they no longer have ties the inclusion of the latino immigrant fairness provisions would evidence our commitment to fair and evenhanded treatment of nations from these countriesand to the strengthening of democracy and economic stability among important neighbors the republican proposal creates a v visa for people waiting in the family backlogs but not all including us citizens this counterproposal treats the family members of some legal permanent residents better than us citizens the gop proposal leaves out us citizens applying for their children over the age of 21 ironically the gop fails to help even united states citizens seeking to reunite with their spouses and children if the spouse of the child fell out of status for six months or more in contrast the latino immigrant fairness act 245 i proposal would cover all people in the pipeline to becoming legal equally i say no deal and a no vote the republicans are failing to correct their flawed legislation of 1997 and 1998 it was the republicans who passed piecemeal programs in 1997 and 1998 for some refugees these flaws failed to correct years of uneven treatment to legitimate refugees from central america haiti and does nothing for liberian nationals it is baffling why today the republicans are now turning their backs on the lifa proposal for long time refugees that have been in the unitedstates for years worked hard and paid their taxes when a few short years ago they advanced these same proposals in conclusion there is not compassion here congress should stop trying to trade some deserving immigrant groups for others and move to help all deserving immigrants

manufacturing concerns and third the western investors are very influential that have businesses set up in china which of those groups wants to see change which of those groups wants china to

things that i want to really stress is that there is a major difference between the approach that the democrats have been taking on the issue of hmo reform versus the approach of the republican leadership a lot of times i worry that americans and our constituents think that what we are proposing on both sides of the aisle is essentially the same and that everyone is trying to do something to protect patients rights during this managed care reform debate but i just think it is important to stress the differences i really feel very strongly that the patients bill of rights the democratic bill that has been put forward and is cosponsored by almost every member on the democratic side really protects patients rights whereas the republican leadership bills that have been put forward both in this congress and in the previous congress really do not do an adequate job of protecting patients and too often look towards the interests of the insurance industry instead in the last session of congress in the last 2 years in 1997 and 1998 there was some debate on the issue of hmo reform but the issue was essentially left unfinished in the 105th congress in the last congress on the house side the democrats patients bill of rights was defeated by just five votes when it came to the floor it was considered on the floor as a substitute to the republican leaderships managed care bill which did pass and which in my opinion was really not a good piece of legislation and did not do anything significant to protect patients in fact the republican leadership in the house has reintroduced a bill in this session of congress that is virtually identical to what it moved last year on the senate side the senate republicans in the socalled help committee approved a managed care bill which really in my opinion is a sham reform bill and does not allow patients to sue the insurance companies but does allow the insurance companies and not the doctors and patients to define what is medically necessary what types of procedures what length of stay what kind of operations would be performed and would be acceptable under an individual insurance policy i just wanted to if i could take a little time this evening to talk about why this republican bill that passed the senate the republican leadership bill in the senate really does not do an adequate job of trying to protect patients rights if you look at the bill that passed the senate or that came out of committee i should say in the senate this year it leaves out more than 100 million americans twothirds of those with private health insurance it fails to grant key protections needed by children women persons with disabilities and others with chronic conditions or special health care needs and it allows medical decisions to continue to be made by insurance company executives instead of by health care professionals and patients the main difference that i have tried to point out between the democrats patients bill of rights and the republican leadership bills that have been sponsored in the house or in the senate really come down to two points and that is that the republican bills really leave it up to the insurance companies to decide what kind of treatment you are going to get and with regard to enforcement they do not have adequate enforcement because if you want to appeal a decision about your treatment that you felt that you should have a particular operation you should be able to stay an extra day or so in the hospital if you try that appeal there is really no process whereby you can appeal the decision of the insurance company and be successful and certainly if you suffer damages you cannot sue for those damages under the republican bill what the democrats tried to do on the senate side in committee in the help committee when this republican hmo bill came up they tried a number of times through amendments to improve the republican bill all those democratic amendments were essentially defeated but i wanted to give you a little idea if i could about the kinds of things that the democrats were trying to do to improve what was essentially a bad bill that did not provide adequate protections for patients in hmos the committee republicans in the senate rejected on a 108 party line vote an amendment by senator ted kennedy to extend the scope of the bill to all privately insured americans as i said the republican bill leaves more than 100 million people unprotected because most of its patient protections are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance and that is selffunded employer plans the committee republicans also rejected on the same 108 party line vote senator kennedys amendment on external appeals again as i mentioned before the republican bill does not create a truly independent external review of plan decisions so if you feel that you are not getting covered adequately and you try to appeal there really is no effective external appeal under the committee bill the republican bill the socalled external review is controlled by the hmos and contains loopholes to allow hmos to delay or prevent patients from appealing a bad medical decision by an hmo bureaucrat many hmo decisions could not even be appealed under the republican bill just to give you another idea of some of the examples i talked about the issue of medical necessity and how it is defined the committee republicans in the senate rejected again on a party line vote 108 an amendment offered by senator kennedy to define the term medical necessity and to prohibit hmos from arbitrarily interfering with medical decisions again just to give you an example of how this operates this amendment would have prevented insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of the treating physician on issues relating to the manner in other words the length of stay in the hospital or the setting inpatient versus outpatient care it would have stopped hmos from overruling doctor and going against accepted and best practices of medicine the committee republicanpassed bill does nothing to protect patients when an insurance company bureaucrat tells them they must have a medical procedure on an outpatient basis or be discharged from the hospital prematurely the republican bill allows hmos to continue to define what is medically necessary giving them the ability to deny promised benefits another example the issue of emergency room care many of my constituents have complained to me that their hmo policy does not allow them to go to the emergency room when they think it is necessary or they have to go to a different hospital that is pretty far away if they want to go to an emergency room they cannot go to the hospital near where they live or where they work well senator murray tried to put in an amendment that again was rejected on a party line vote 108 to strengthen coverage for emergency care under the republican bill it is not clear whether a true prudent layperson standard applies to all of the plans covered prudent layperson says that if the average prudent person would think it was necessary to go to the emergency room then you can go to whatever emergency room is close by and readily available well many insurance policies many hmos do not allow that and so the democrats are saying we want to have that prudent layperson standard put into the hmo reform bill instead what happened is that in this case again the ability to apply that prudent layperson standard was rejected by the committee and what that means is that under the republican bill there still is no guarantee that you can go to the closest emergency room or that even if you go to the emergency room and later the hmo decides well you really should not have gone because it was not really an emergency that they can just deny coverage and say you shouldnt have gone to the emergency room therefore were not going to pay for the emergency room care another example that i think is important is with regard to specialists many of my constituents complain that their hmo reform bill does not provide them with access to specialists that they may need in a given circumstance senators harein and reed had an amendment to this republican bill that again was rejected along party lines that would ensure that patients have access to needed specialists under the republican bill patients could be charged more for outofnetwork specialty care even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan so if you decide that you want to go to a doctor i will give you an example perhaps you want to go see a pediatrician but as many people know today that for children there are pediatric specialists for different areas of pediatrics under the republican bill if there is nobody that has that specialty and you decide that you want to see that kind of pediatrician for your child then you can go out of the network but you have to pay for it again what we were saying with this democratic amendment is that access to specialty care should be provided outside the hmo if there is no one within the hmo that has that specialty and is part of the network but again that was an amendment that was rejected i will only mention one more effort on the democrats part to try to improve this bad bill if you will and there are many others but i will only mention one other one and that was senator kennedys amendment again rejected on a 108 party line vote with regard to liability the republican bill fails to hold limos accountable when their actions result in injury or death i mentioned this before you cannot sue the republican plan would protect most hmos from liability even when someone becomes disabled or is killed senator kennedys amendment in the democrats patients bill of rights would allow 123 million patients who receive coverage through private employers to hold their hmos and health insurance plans accountable under state laws for their abuses this is one of the loopholes if you will in the current law and that is that if you are not covered by certain state laws and your health insurance comes from your private employer oftentimes you cannot sue we were trying to correct that as well if i could just say that basically what i am trying to point out tonight is that there are major differences here and that when we look at what is happening on the issue of hmo or managed care reform it is obviously important that we have an opportunity in this session of congress to get a vote on this issue one of the criticisms that i have of the republican leadership is that frankly it is now april almost may and they have not even allowed us to have any kind of a vote there has not been any movement in subcommittee in the committee on commerce that i am a member of or in the full committee to bring any kind of hmo or managed care reform to the floor so we need to at least start the movement but when that movement starts and when we do have an opportunity to vote on hmo reform we have to understand that there is a major difference between the patients bill of rights which is being brought forth by the democrats and the republican leadership proposal now you do not have to take my word for it one of the things that i think is important is that we look at some of the commentators and what they are saying about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on this issue but i wanted to read if i could all or some parts of an editorial that appeared in the new york times on saturday april 10 earlier this month that talked about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on the issue of patient rights just about everyone on capitol hill professes interest in producing legislation that protects patients from unfair health insurance practices but the prospect of actually passing meaningful protections as opposed to talking about it is uncertain president clinton tried to whip up support for democratic proposals but the republicans are balking at democratic plans as too burdensome on the managed care industry yet it is the democratic proposals that more fully reflect the recommendations of a presidential advisory commission to improve health plan quality the republican senate bill s 326 sponsored by senator jeffords of vermont is too limited to accomplish that purpose the bill which was approved by the senate help or health education labor and pensions committee on a straight party line vote of 108 contains some consumer protections but it is unacceptable because most of the provisions would apply only to 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers leaving 110 million americans in other plans unprotected the republican bill would grant appeal rights to an additional 75 million privately insured individuals but those rights would be quite restrictive appeals to an external reviewer would be allowed only when an insurer refused to pay for a procedure on the grounds that it was not medically necessary or was experimental critics say this would give health plans power to limit appeals by simply asserting that a denial is not based on medical necessity it would exclude appeals where a plan unilaterally decided that the benefit was not covered under the contract even if medical judgments were involved in that contract interpretation the republican bill does not adequately ensure access to specialty care by allowing a patient to see an outofnetwork specialist if the plan has an insufficient number of specialists available both the senate democratic proposal which has white house support and a bipartisan bill sponsored by senators john chafee joseph lieberman and others would be substantially stronger in allowing external review of coverage disputes and defining medical necessity and in giving enrollees greater rights to take health plans to court the insurance lobby has already embarked on a media blitz to defeat any new regulations as too costly but consumer protections under the democratic plan would increase health plan costs by only 2 8 percent according to congressional budget office estimates made last year health plans should be made to deliver what they promise their enrollees and held accountable when they fail i think that new york times editorial really sums up what i am trying to say tonight which is the fact of the matter is that if the patients bill of rights the democratic patients bill of rights would be substantially stronger in almost every aspect of managed care reform over the republican proposal now i just wanted to briefly mention again the important areas where the patients bill of rights a democratic bill of rights really provides for a very good protection for patients once again and most importantly the democratic patients bill of rights allows doctors and patients rather than insurance company bureaucrats to make medical decisions using the principles of good medicine in addition it would first guarantee access to needed health care specialists the democratic bill provides access to emergency room services when and where the need arises the democratic bill provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped the democrats patients bill of rights gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process and the democratic patients bill of rights assures that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options and not be gagged because the insurance company says that you cannot talk about something that is not covered the patients bill of rights would also assure that women have direct access to ob gyn and finally and almost as important really as the medical necessity issue is that the democrats patients bill of rights provides an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions i sound very partisan this evening and i do not mean to suggest that there are not republican members on the other side of the aisle that are supportive of the patients bill of rights or the types of protections that i think that are needed in a comprehensive hmo reform bill i know that there are members on the other side that would like to see these types of protections provided under the law but the bottom line is that the republican leadership which is in charge of the house keeps producing legislation or keeps proposing legislation both in the house and in the senate that does not adequately protect patients and i think it is very important that we not only move ahead in this session of congress and quickly on hmo reform but that we move ahead with an hmo reform that adequately protects patients rights that is comprehensive and addresses what i consider the major issue that my constituents and most americans seem to be concerned about at this time"], [0.001513361930847168, 0.9984866380691528, 1, "i thank my colleague for yielding me the customary half hour and i yield myself such time as i may consume people are starting to get their hopes up with this budget with the new surplus and the new millennium it looks like anything is possible unfortunately they with the new surplus and the new millennium it looks like anything is possible unfortunately they are in for a huge disappointment last weeks unveiling of my republican colleagues new budget proved to be more of the same all bad ideas despite predictions of medicare and social security catastrophes looming on the horizon the republican budget does nothing to extend the life of either social security or medicare for even one day but it still manages to siphon 775 billion into tax cuts for the richest americans instead of investing in education health care to prepare this country for the next century like nero the republican budget fiddles while social security and medicare burn the chief actuary of the social security administration has said this budget will have virtually no effect on the date that social security becomes insolvent it will just make sure that it goes broke on schedule that is not me speaking that is the chief actuary of the social security administration in contrast the democratic budget has a lock box which will protect social security until the year 2050 and protect medicare until the year 2020 my republican colleagues propose a plan that is less secure than the democrats and treasury secretary rubin recommended that the president of the united states veto it because in reality the republican lock box is more of an open till the differences do not stop there the democratic budget reduces the debt more than the republican budget every year that it is in effect the democratic budget provides 40 billion more for veterans health care over the next 10 years than the republican budget we made our veterans a promise we must keep that promise americas fighting men and women risk their lives for this country they deserve the very best health care the best services we can give them but my republican colleagues will not allow a vote will not even allow a vote on the clement veterans amendment the democratic budget provides more for defense spending over the long run than the republican budget because in the later years my republican colleagues had to choose between defense spending and tax cuts what do my colleagues think mr speaker they chose the tax cuts meanwhile the democratic budget still manages to provide some balanced tax cuts and keep our economy from slipping back into deficit the republican budget on the other hand will create a whole new deficit by the year 2014 the democratic budget does more to reduce class size and modernize our schools than the republican budget which will cut spending for head start cut spending for pell grants and cut money for work study the democratic budget protects important programs like wic which the republican budget cuts by so much that 1 2 million women infants and children will lose their benefits next year 16 400 of them live in my home state of massachusetts the wic program provides essential nutrition and education during the early years of the childrens development in order to make sure that they start school ready to learn if we do not give them good nutrition when they are very young we lose our chance forever some of my democratic colleagues tried to make sure that we got that chance but this rule does not make in order the defazio amendment on the progressive budget the clement amendment on the veterans budget or the mink amendment on education this rule does make in order the shadeggcoburn amendment which some people are equating with president clintons budget they say it reflects some cbo comparison i want to make something perfectly clear the shadeggcoburn amendment looks as much like president clintons budget as i look like gwyneth paltrow looking at this budget we would think that my republican colleagues have very sharp memories when it comes to bad habits that gave us the budget deficits in the 1980s and the tripling of our national debt now that our budget finally is in the black we should be very very careful about repeating those mistakes so i urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question if the previous question is defeated we will make in order the clement amendment to take care of our american veterans our veterans deserve every bit of care we can give them this country made them a promise this country should live up to that promise yesterdays unitedstatesa today says if your member of congress comes home this weekend bragging about having adopted a responsible federal budget dont you believe it so i urge my colleagues to defeat the republican budget todays vote gives us an unprecedented chance to protect social security to protect medicare for the next generation let us not let that chance go by i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0015706419944763184, 0.9984293580055237, 1, "i do not know what it will take for my colleagues on both sides of the house to acknowledge as i said earlier this morning that more than 83 percent of the american people are asking us to vote for a freestanding upstanding hmo reform bill today and i think one of those is little steve olson a 2yearold who went hiking with his parents as he was hiking he fell ill went to an emergency room and was treated for meningitis but the little boy still experienced pain could not express himself they went back to that emergency room but they could not get any more care they could not get him to do a brain scan because the hmo denied it and now this little boy because he had a lump on his brain has cerebral palsy the american people are asking us to stop the parliamentary maneuvers that would not allow us to have a freestanding bill on managed care access to emergency rooms the sanctity of the physicianpatient relationship and the american people are asking us to deal with the uninsured in a separate manner because there are working poer who cannot pay for their insurance and this bill does not do it the american people have asked us to have an amendment on 7 billion to ensure that we pay for this i just conclude by saying my colleagues let us join together and get a real hmo reform bill the dingellnorwood bill i rise to strongly oppose the rule for todays managed care bills the rule is a sham and seeks to undermine these two vital health bills instead of providing a fair and open rule for considering the patients bill of rights the majority has written an unreasonable rule that combines the managed care bill with a measure riddled with special interest poison pills designed to kill the measure this rule guarantees that we will not be able to offset any potential revenue losses from the measure and we will not be able to establish the health care services that we hoped to provide for the citizens of this country the majority has shown a grave error in judgment by including special interest provisions in the managed care bill this act is fiscally irresponsible because no funding is provided for these provisions worse yet this rule denies a bipartisan group of members from offering an amendment to pay for this bill because the access bill and managed care bill are combined in one rule managed care reform may be defeated through parliamentary maneuvering this is untenable merging these bills into one rule is unacceptable because it combines a bill that helps those who need health care h r 2723 with a bill h r 2990 that simply helps the nations most healthy and wealthy and not the uninsured we must separate these two bills so we can ensure that h r 2723 provides new patient protections sets nationwide standards for health insurance and expands medical liability these issues are vitally important to all of the american people not just the privileged yet these bills these once glimmering symbols of managed care reform that sought to stretch their healing arms around each of our citizens have now been twisted and manipulated into one hideous unrecognizable heap of special interest slag in particular poison pill amendments have been offered to the bipartisan consensus managed care improvement act of 1999 the boehner amendment benefits the healthy and wealth instead of the uninsured those who need the most help the gosscoburn amendment weakens patient protections cap noneconomic damages and guts enforcement provisions the houghtongraham amendment provides far too weak federal remedies and internal reveiw procedures an open rule would allow us to correct these problems but by providing only one rule for both hmo bills we prevent ourselves from doing any good today do we want to tell the american public that it will not receive the managed care reform it has so desperately sought because of a procedural bar the sobering truth is that our citizens need health care reformespecially those living in poverty over onethird of the unitedstates population was living in or near poverty in 1996 the majority of africanamerican 55 percent and persons of hispanic origin 60 percent lived in families classified as poor or near poor in the southern portions of the united states the poverty rate is 15 percent my home state of texas had poverty rate over 16 percent of those suffering from poverty 44 1 percent are uninsured 44 4 percent of africanamericans in poverty are uninsured and 58 7 percent of hispanics in poverty are uninsured these numbers are sobering and we must do something about them people living in poverty and many minority citizens simply cannot afford health insurance and in tum cannot obtain quality health care their lack of access to quality health care has devastating effects because many minority groups and people living in poverty are particularly susceptible to health problems racial and ethnic minorities constitute approximately 25 percent of the total unitedstates population yet they account for nearly 54 percent of all aids cases for men and women combined blacks have a cancer death rate about 35 percent higher than that for whites the ageadjusted death rate for coronary heart disease for the total population declined by 20 percent from 1987 to 1995 for blacks the overall decrease was only 13 percent the bipartisan consensus managed care improvement act of 1999 is also important due to the reforms it provides because even when people do have insurance quality health care is not guaranteed take for instance steven olsona once healthy thriving twoyear old child after falling on a stick while hiking with his parents twoyearold steven was rushed to the emergency room where he was treated his mother returned him a week later because he was in great pain he was treated for meningitis and sent home steven continued to complain about pain but despite his parents protest the hmo doctors refused to perform a brain scan even though it was a covered benefit steven eventually fell into a coma due to a brain abscess that herniated he now has cerebral palsy an 800 brain scan would have prevented this tragedy in an even more tragic case a woman attempted to switch doctors when it became clear that her original doctor would not fully examine a growing and discolored mole on her ankle paperwork and bureaucracy resulted in a sixmonth wait once the woman finally visited a seconddoctor she was immediately sent to a dermatologist who determined that the mole was a malignant melanoma the woman died one year later both sides of the aisle should be working together to ensure that these stories never surface ever again yet this rule encourages special interest gutting of the bill and negates any amendment that would provide the necessary 7 billion in offsets for revenue losses estimated to result from increased deductions for higher medical premiums over 200 organizations support the bipartisan consensus managed care improvement act of 1999 including aids action the american academy of pediatrics the american heart association the american medical association and the national association of public hospitals but these organizations cannot support the bill as offered the special interest additions and weakened bill language undermine the goals of these groups without an open rule that would allow us to correct these problems we will essentially slam the door on the very groups who can provide us with the greatest support and resources this rule does not penalize the minority side it penalizes the very people we representthe american taxpayers we need an open rule that will permit the enactment of effective managed care reform i urge my colleagues to vote no against this unfair rule and against this distorted version of thebill"], [0.0015846490859985352, 0.9984153509140015, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding the gentleman has indicated that he has seen with his own eyes and felt the terror himself that is an amazing experience especially since there have been denials by the government even some in this country that there is slavery in the sudan this gentleman has seen it with his own eyes later on i would like to indicate some of the testimony from exslaves former slaves in the sudan so as to make more vivid why this is such a pressing issue for decent people around the world the gentleman has indicated that there are schoolchildren in this country so moved that they have started their own abolitionist movement we have churches and other americans who just feel they cannot stay still actually we do not know how many slaves there are they are african slaves we know that the estimates go from 20 000 to 100 000 with all the chaos and civil war in sudan no one has kept a record although amazingly there are villages where they literally keep close records of people who have been stolen we know they are christians and they are animists animism simply is a kind of native african religion these are the two groups that are targeted here the sudan is 70 percent muslim only about 5 percent are christian apparently they are seen as some kind of threat what we have in the sudan is a kind of cultural war a desire to wipe out the culture of these people the religion of these people nobody should feel as strongly as americans where people fled precisely because people were trying to convert them to a religion that was not their own if they have a religion they have to remain with that religion so a civil war breaks out when we say to people you cannot have your religion or you cannot have your culture you have to have some other culture as the gentleman has said this has been going on for a very long time here in a real sense the animus between these two groups precedes their independence and is ancient nevertheless it has become absolutely intolerable in our world today the antislavery movement as it were involves everything from classrooms and schoolchildren to a swiss group that makes it its business to go around essentially buying back slaves they have freed that is to say bought back upward of 20 000 slaves at the same time i have to report that the antislavery movement that buys back slaves has become controversial at least in some official circles when we hear that people are buying back slaves the first instinct is to say thank goodness unicef and some others have indicated some compunctions however about buying back slaves because they think that it motivates the slave raiders to capture more african slaves and drives up the prices we can imagine though how the schoolchildren and groups who are buying back slaves respond to that nobody else is doing anything about it if you were a slave i guess you would figure if anybody comes along that can get me out of this and free me then please let them do so until we find a governmental solution we are leaving these slaves either to rot in slavery or to some selfhelp escape or of course to whatever help private individuals can bring to them the argument on the other side from those who have been buying slaves is that there has been no increase in the slave trade as a result of buying back slaves in fact they say that during period of intense liberation when slaves had been brought back in large numbers the raids have decreased i am not certain and there are no official objective observers that can tell us one way or the other i do know that the slaves are between a rock and a hard place nobody has come up with a solution we can understand why people would step forward and say we have to do whatever we can do please remember slavery in this country please remember john brown please remember the abolitionists who were considered extremists because when slavery was the official policy of the united states and nobody would do anything about it people were driven to do whatever they could at least what is happening with churches here with the schoolchildren with the swiss movement that is buying back slaves is peaceful and is liberating people it puts a price on peoples heads but they of course are free the gentleman has also spoken about another movement there is the liberation movement and there is the divestment movement i agree with him that at the very least the divestment movement is called for i do believe that with what has happened in new jersey to divest in talisman energy which is canadas oldest independent oil company what has happened there is likely to catch fire everywhere else in neighboring new york the first elected black official statewide the comptroller carl mccall is leading his state towards the same kind of disinvestment that new jersey has begun i must say to the gentleman from new jersey i cannot help but believe that it is the gentlemans work that has led his state to be the first to come forward and say to talisman not in this country i think the gentleman deserves much of the credit for what has happened in new jersey i want to tell the gentleman that he has inspired me to look into the pension funds of the district of columbia and to ask my counsel and my mayor to look to see if we are invested in talisman energy i hope that at least out of what we are doing this evening and out of what the gentleman has encouraged to happen already in new jersey we can encourage americans and others around the world to engage in a divestment movement i do not know if there are other companies talisman energy has of course caught the attention of the country and they deserve the disinvestment they are receiving i would say to the gentleman i do have more to say but in the spirit of going back and forth in the colloquy in which we are engaged i yield back to the gentleman at this time"], [0.0015853643417358398, 0.9984146356582642, 1, "i am pleased to stand before you as we

together for the good of the country yesterday we commemorated george washingtons birthday an everlasting model of leadership and achievement 200 years ago as our first president ably led the united states from revolution into democracy today there are many issues that claim congressional attention for immediate action including specific improvements for social security education greater access to health care employment taxes the environment and economic opportunity and prosperity our nation faces many challenges on the eve of the millennium but inherent in those challenges are a great many opportunities our nation has flourished during this decade and right now as we face the new millennium the most appropriate message we can provide to all americans is to express our commitment to the fundamental values of our democracy as new initiatives to benefit american citizens immigrants and the children of undocumented immigrants in the country are developed and implemented i do not see the same concern for the 3 8 million united states citizens in puerto rico the americans in the island continue to be neglected and discriminated against by being barred from equitable participation in the most fundamental rights of citizenship the right to vote and the right to representation not to mention participation in the safety net programs that provide basic relief to the neediest in the nation the disadvantaged the aged the handicapped and the children it is distressing to behold that by virtue of living in a territory some american citizens do not have the same rights and benefits as all other americans in the nation why are citizens in the territories denied what all other citizens are guaranteed are there two different kinds of citizenship in our nation the example of democracy what is even more discouraging is that not only the great expectations for future success and equal participation do not apply to puerto ricans in the islands but that residents in the island will continue to lag further and further behind as they are fenced out from the rest of the nation throughout my political life i have fought to provide equality for the united states citizens in puerto rico and i wonder how our nation can continue to maintain separate but equal policies similar to the discriminatory policies that were the force that brought about the enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 i am compelled to provide a voice for the thousands of low income disadvantaged the handicapped elderly and children who are deprived of the most basic safety net programs that all other americans and immigrants can participate in the 50 states of the union it is terrible to consider that our nations commitment to equality in health does not extend to the american citizens in puerto rico or in guam or in the virgin islands and thus deprives us of the necessary medical care that may prove the difference between life and death by virtue of the fact that we reside in a territory health discrimination is an abomination this includes medicaid for which puerto rico contrary to the policy for all other states receives a block grant capped this year at 171 5 million i am also talking about our exclusion from supplemental security income the supplemental income that ensures blind disadvantaged and handicapped individuals have income protection i am also talking about medicare and how reimbursement for providers has been set at a lower rate despite the fact that costs are comparable to the provision of services in many states unfortunately as the nation benefits from the tremendous budget surplus the americans in the territory will also be excluded from many of the most significant policy initiatives presented this session the 500 billion social security enhancement proposed by the universal savings accounts commonly referred to as the usa accounts will not apply to the citizens in the island even though we contribute to social security equally as all other citizens what is more money from our contributions to the social security funds will be used to manage and administer the program which will be denied to us but this initiative is just one of the many new proposals that will not apply to the nearly 4 million unitedstates citizens in puerto rico many other proposals ranging from welfare to work to building new schools to providing incentives to workers and even the empowerment zones and the new market initiatives that aim to simulate the economic will bypass us in the next century we will not have the opportunity to contribute to the wellbeing of the economy nor participate in the tax credits that are being proposed i feel compelled to bring these matters to your attention and to the attention of all my colleagues in congress because our nation must do something to ensure that the american citizens in puerto rico are equal americans how can our nation stand as a model for the world when it maintains a policy of discrimination a policy of economic and political apartheid for 100 years we have stood shoulder to shoulder as we have defended freedom and democratic values wherever and whenever it has been needed in the world as we enter the millennium we should not be pushed behind our fellow citizens in the 50 states it is a national shame that in our country american citizens must time and time again beg to

from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting them in two they are asking if they can get half a prescription filled because they simply cant afford it we need to change that"], [0.9981911778450012, 0.9981911778450012, 0, "i thank my friend and colleague the gentleman from colorado for yielding me time and i appreciate his giving me the opportunity tonight to be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now

ralph j perk if we were to ask residents of the city of cleveland about et cetera citys recent history they might point us to the bridge at state route 21 over the cuyahoga river as the point where 25 years ago the cuyahoga river caught on fire or they might direct us to the factory where mayor perk while attempting to show some blue collar voters that he was proficient in the use of a blow torch accidentally set his hair on fire but clevelanders love to tell the story about when mayor perk a republican was invited to a state dinner by then president richard nixon and it conflicted with his wife lucys bowling night so he was not able to be in attendance on that particular evening ralph perk was vintage cleveland and he will be greatly missed he is best known as clevelands mayor but he had a distinguished career as a public servant he began his political career in 1940 as a republican precinct committeeman and was appointed to the staff of the ohio attorney generals office in 1950 he then went on to represent the broadway east 55th street area of cleveland as a councilman from 1953 to 1962 he was then elected to countywide office and served as the county auditor for 9 years when he was elected mayor mayor perk had the distinction of being the first republican mayor of cleveland since the 1930s in fact only two republicans have served as the mayor of cleveland in my lifetime ralph perk and also our new senator from ohio george voinovich god love ralph perk he was a republican in the days when being a republican was not very cool his political base was found in clevelands heavily democratic ethnic communities which supported him regardless of party label he won folks over with his heart and his ability to be just like everyone else to connect with his fellow

city of cleveland it is a badge of honor mayor perk served as mayor from 1972 to 1977 at a time when the city was developing some financial difficulties but ralph perk was able to work with the federal government and the nixon white house to secure funding to alleviate a number of those difficulties he is credited with establishing a regional sewer district and he is also credited with paying off the bonds using city funds to pay off the bonds of the financially strapped cleveland transit authority to create what is now the greater cleveland regional transit authority although it

of congress we have a responsibility to exercise oversight over a wide range of issues this is one of our most fundamental obligations and it includes investigating potential problems both in the executive branch and the private sector along with that responsibility comes extraordinary power we have the power to require citizens to come before us and respond to detailed questions about their lives we have the power to require citizens to provide us with their most sensitive personal information including their bank records telephone logs and diaries and when we make allegations about the conduct of citizens our statements are broadcast on television and radio and printed in newspapers all across the country we thus have the power to permanently tarnish individuals reputations so it is essential that when we fulfill our responsibilities to investigate we investigate responsibly and be accountable for what we do when we make a serious charge about an individuals conduct we shotild be certain of the accuracy of our accusation if we later learn of information that refutes that charge we ought to correct the record and when we harm individuals by making charges that are wrong we

repeatedly made sensational public allegations against individual american citizens many of these initial allegations have received widespread coverage in the media further investigation however often has shown that the allegations are unsupported by the facts and when the facts eventually do emerge the news media inevitably gives little ittention to the truth and the public record is rarely corrected let me give you an example in june 1997 former representative gerald solomon the chairman of the house rules committee claimed he had evidence from a government source that john huang the former commerce department official and democratic national committee fundraiser had coinmitted economic espionage and breached our national security this allegation of espionage was very serious it amounted to a claim of treason the most serious accusation that can be brought against an american it was reported on national television and in newspapers across the country but it turns out that that allegation was based on nothing more than gossip at a reception when the fbi interviewed mr solomon about this allegation he told the fbi that he was told by a senate staffer at a capitol hill reception that the staffer received confirmation that a department of commerce employee had passed classified information to a foreign government according to the fbi interview notes the senate staffer did not say that the employee was john huang nor did he say that information went to china representative solomon did not know who the staffer was in a second interview with the fbi representative solomon recalled that what the staffer said to him was congressman you might like to know that you were right there was someone at commerce giving out information again in this interview representative solomon told the fbi that he did not know the name of the staffer who made this comment in fact the only way mr solomon could identify the staffer was to describe him as a male in his 30s or 40s approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall with brownish hair here is another example in june 1999 representative dan burton issued a press release accusing defense department

that these types of weapons will show up in school or on the playground or in the hands of other children the amendment i offer today will prohibit juveniles from processing semiautomatic assault

for use of such a weapon in selfdefense or for taking legal title but not physical possession of the weapon through inheritance these exceptions are those that apply under the current law to the
