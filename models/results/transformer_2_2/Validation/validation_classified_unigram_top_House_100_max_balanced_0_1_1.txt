gentleman for yielding to me what i would like to do is simply repeat the remarks that i gave in california in san francisco at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton

of the first weekends in which i left and came back to washington the flags were at half mast i was absolutely shocked to learn that they were at half mast because our friend phil burton had died several weeks ago coming to work after a snowstorm again i noticed that the flags were at half mast much to my sorrow i learned that they were at half mast because sala burton who had so ably and really nobly stepped into phils congressional seat and maintained so much of the inspiration and legacy that he stood for and expanded it in so many ways had also passed away sala burton to me was an extremely important member of this delegation member of this house and personal friend as so many others have indicated sala burtons first concern with regard to her relationship with me and it seemed virtually everybody was family sala immediately established a close relationship not just with me but with my wife jan as well every time i saw her she was deeply concerned about how jan was how my kids were how my family was doing this was not just lip service this was something sala truly cared about sala burton was one of the more compassionate people that i will ever know in my lifetime she cared deeply about the dispossessed she cared deeply about the underprivileged she cared deeply about those who were powerless to represent themselves and she eloquently acted as their champion saia burton as i recalled several weeks ago in that prior special order was not a person who had to think very carefully weighing back and forth where she would come out on a particular issue particularly if that issue had anything whatsoever to do with human dignity or social justice sala burton knew whose side she was on she championed that side she never wavered in that commitment whether in private or public of any person in american public life sala burton was one of the most eloquent spokespeople for people who suffered and people in need sma was somebody who in a short time in the house made an extraordinary impression as a human being and as a legislator she was a very dear personal friend and somebody who i miss very much and will continue to miss i simply wanted to come to the floor

can to get that bill passed because she felt that it was a grave terrible injustice after sala had finished that conversation with me i felt so comforted because knowing that she in this congress as a

have voted to do that many many times the debate today is about the most effective way to fight communism i believe that there is a better more effective way to fight communism than the presidents latest plan first it is important to look at exactly what is in the presidents plan it has changed tremendously since the first press accounts of it were written and it has even changed in the last few hours the nature of the plan is particularly important since following the presidents wishes he did not want to allow congress the chance to amend or modify his plan he wanted a simple yes or no up or down vote on the measure and congress agreed the president surely knew that he was taking a very risky position when he requested this because he could win everything or lose everything this is not to say that this will be the last vote on the issue far from it i have already voted on contra aid over 16 times in my 6 years in congress we will have another vote on it before the end of this month and probably two or three more before the end of the reagan administration when the presidents plan was rumored to be a 270 million appropriation covering a period of 18 months it looked as if the vote was going to be one of the most important foreign policy votes of the decade its importance diminished however when the president scaled back his package to 36 million over a period of only 4 months it is still a key vote but it does not set government policy toward central america through the end of the presidents term in fact well vote again in february june and probably september it is also important to realize that nothing in the presidents proposal affects the amount of aid to be delivered this month that means that the next congressional vote on the subject will be in time to continue the aid in an uninterrupted fashion looking at the presidents specific package it would almost triple the amount of aid that the contias have been receiving every month the past level has been between 3 and 4 million every month the new level would be between 10 and 12 million there is a significant dispute as to how much of this aid would be lethal nonlethal or strictly humanitarian but there is little doubt that a tripling of funding per month would be seen on the ground in nicaragua as a significant escalation of the war i have appreciated the advice of my constituents in making up my mind about the presidents package i have met with the american legioni was the only tennessee congressman to attend their briefingas well as with church groups i raised the issue in 14 recent meetings in 14 different counties i have communicated with constituents by phone as well as in writing this has not been an easy decison but i have appreciated their guidance i wish that they had been privy to the presidents most recent versions of his proposal because i would like to have had their specific thoughts on it i have carefully listened to thir president as well and i thought it was a lerible decision on the part of the television networks not to carry his latest speech to the nation on the subject my conclusion after all this careful thought and consultation is that the presidents package is not the most effective way to counter the sandinista threat in central america the events of recent months in the regionthe president reagan speaker wright peace plan the arias plan the signing of a peace agreement the pressure of the four democratic central american presidents against daniel ortega the awarding of the nobel peace prize to president ariasthe most forceful and prodemocratic regional leaderand the making of significant sandinista concessionshave altered the political landscape in the region now for the first time the sandinistas have lifted the state of emergency they are negotiating a ceasefire facetoface with the contras and they promised an extensive amnesty president reagan should take pride in the fact that his bipartisan peace plan started this process of course i still dont trust ortega any farther than i can throw him we will need to watch him like a hawk to make sure that he keeps his promises we will need to verify everything that he does and to count his mistakes as well as his successes he has already made some mistakes we also need to preserve all of our options the contras included in case that ortega changes his mind or fails to live up to his promises i have supported humanitarian aid for the contras in the past i support it now the house leadership has promised a vote on aid to the contras by the end of this month that would keep them intact as a military force we need to preserve this policy option but the presidents plan limits our policy options it risks escalating the war in violation of the peace agreement that has been signed by the central american nations it would probably in my view ruin any future hope that a peaceful solution to the conflict could be found while there is a real chance for a peaceful solution i feel that most americans want to know that all peaceful means have been exhausted before major military force is used another consideration that is easy to overlook is that ortega would love to use increased contra aid as an excuse to stop keeping his promises and to reimpose the state of emergency in nicaragua why give ortega this out right now the eyes of the world are on whether he keeps his promises why allow him to blame us for escalating what h alleges is an invasion into his country for the first time in years world attention is focused not on the abuses of the contras but on the abuses of the sandinstas and their promises to reform the peace talks are doing a better job right now of unmasking the sandinistas for what they are than anything we have done in the last several years if he keeps all of his promises fine if he does not then world opinion will be on our side for the first time and we will still have all of our military options in tle meantime we should enjoy watching daniel ortega squirm to sum up i do not feel that the presidents plan is the best way to battle communism in the region because first there is a chance for a peaceful solution and second whether the peace talks are successful or not they are currently winning us more allies in our fight in a sense we are giving ortega a little rope and for that it is easy to criticize us but he may hang himself with that rope if he fails to keep his commitments while we wait for the outcome of the talks it is important to keep the contras intact as a fighting force in case we need them the vote at the end of february should do that the result of such a policy is not to reduce any of our options but to increase them by using the peace talks to our advantage i feel that this is the best way to oppose the communist threat in central america"], [0.0005646944046020508, 0.500564694404602, 0, "that is right it goes on it is clear that irrespective of the support that the united states
