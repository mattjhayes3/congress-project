the administration to sign and ratify the protocols of the south pacific nuclearfree zone treaty also known as the treaty of rarotonga since it was signed by the leaders of the pacific nations on the island of rarotonga cook islands with ratification of the treaty of rarotonga by eight countries in december 1986 the nations of the south pacific have created a nuclearfree zone in the region to combat the specter of nuclear proliferation i am proud to have introduced this measure that symbolizes americas sensitivity on this issue of tremendous concern to the peoples of the south pacific i also want to express my deepest appreciation to the original cosponsors of house concurrent resolution 111 for their support the honorable gary ackerman chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asiapacific affairs the honorable howard berman chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on international operations the honorable ronald dellums chairman of the house armed services committee the honorable connm morella chairwoman of the arms control and foreign policy caucus the honorable jim mcdermott secretarytreasury of the arms control and foreign policy caucus the honorable michael kopetsai and the honorable pete stark house leaders in the fight to stop nuclear proliferation the honorable matthew martinez member of the foreign affairs committee and chairman of the house education and labor subcommittee on human resources and the honorable neil abercrombie and the honorable patsy mink the distinguished delegation from the great state in the pacific hawaii i submit thee statements of my colleagues for the record in august 1989 my colleagues former house asiapacific affairs chairman stephen solarz representatives robert dornan and i traveled to the south pacific meeting with the leaders of the island nations to discuss pressing concerns of the region and americas role in addressing those needs next to the threat of uncontrolled drift net fishing in the south pacific by foreign fleets foremost in the minds of these island leaders was our countrys lack of support for the treaty of rarotonga with the cessation of drift net fishing in the south pacific the failure of the united states to join the spnfz treaty has become the most crucial issue in the region the treaty of rarotonga constitutes a symbol for the peoples of the south pacific expressing their high level of concern regarding nuclear weapons and the possibility of a nuclear holocaust in the region by refusing to sign the treatys protocols while the soviet union and the peoples republic of china have done so the united states is increasingly portrayed as being insensitive to the needs and desires of its allies in the south pacific if there were good and valid reasons behind our countrys failure to support their friends in the pacific on thismatter of vital importance to them perhaps i could understand but after lengthy review and analysis it is clear that the treaty of rarotonga and its protocols would not undermine unitedstates security practices or military operations in the south pacific whatsoever past administrations while testifying before congress on the spnfz treaty have conceded this point this is reflective of the fact that our allies carefully drafted the document at every stage to accommodate unitedstates interests provisions in the treaty for example specifically protect our nations right of air and sea passage through the treaty zone by american planes and ships carrying nuclear weapons moreover we would not be setting precedent by signing the nuclearfree protocols of the treaty of rarotonga that ground was broken decades ago when the united states signed and ratified the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons in latin america a document substantially identical to the treaty of rarotonga protocols the united states is also a signatory to the nuclear free zone prohibitions contained in the antarctic treaty the seabed arms control treaty and the treaty on principles for outer space exploration furthermore our great nation has supported the possible formation of nuclear free zones in the south asia subcontinent the middle east and africa the nations of the south pacific rightfully ask why we have demonstrated concern for the threat of nuclear devastation to latin americans and the inhabitants of antarctica the sea floor and outer spaceyet we refuse to show such sensitivity to the aspirations of the peoples of oceania our countrys lack of responsiveness to the south pacifics call for a nuclearfree zone cannot help but also be seen by those in the region as tacit encouragement for france to resume her longcriticized nuclear testing program in the pacific after over 100 nuclear bombs have been detonated deep within french polynesias mururoa atoll it has been described by scientific researchers as a swiss cheese of fractured rock leakage of radioactive waste from mururoa atolls underground test sites to the surface waters and air has been predicted and is inevitable this embodies the environmental nightmare that the inhabitants of the south pacific have long dreaded it is not surprising that reports of increased cancer rates amongst tahitians have surfaced the damage to the marine environment can only be imagined when france announced her nuclear testing moratorium last year the news was occasion for great celebration throughout the pacific in looking at the environmental havoc that is a necessary byproduct of nuclear testing one need only study our countrys experience in the pacific after the united states detonated nuclear devices in the 1940s and 1950s on bikini and rongelap atolls in the marshall islands the ravaging effects of nuclear radiation on the islands environment and its former inhabitants are still evident today as a member from the pacific region i have grown up immersed in the controversy of nuclear testing for a long time this issue has been in the forefront of my mind since childhood we pacific islanders know from firsthand experience the horrors of nuclear testing even now decades later the legacy of the unitedstates testing program in the marshall islands is still being felt people there have not forgotten memories of the offspring of pacific islander women infected by radiation falloutwhere babies were born dead that didnt look human and were termed jelly babies these people of the pacific are still trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives and culture our great nation learned a lesson from its pacific experience that should never be forgotten as a result we have stopped our nuclear testing in the south pacific in the face of that experience and in light of united states support of nuclearfree zones around the world how can we sit idly by while our friends in the pacific ask for our help in stopping nuclear madness in the fragile marine environment of the south pacific the world stands at a moment in time where we either move forward toward global peace and harmony or we step back and sink into a morass of nuclear paranoia and armaggedoninspired nightmares with france russia and the entire world looking to our great nation for leadership of nuclear nonproliferation and testing issues america cannot shirk her duty it is time that our nation the worlds greatest democracy step forward to answer the call for a world no longer held hostage to the threat of nuclear devastation joining the south pacific nuclearfree zone treaty would be a giant step forward for america and cannot but help enhance our nations leadership to extend the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban i strongly urge our colleagues to support house concurrent resolution 111 and we call upon the clinton administration to sign and ratify the protocols of the south pacific nuclearfree zone treaty i am including at this point in the record a letter to secretary of defense les

restoration of historic buildings at historically black colleges and universities this bill was introduced on august 6 1993 and was approved by the natural resources committee on november 10 1993 many of the historic structures located on historically black college and university campuses are threatened and a significant effort is needed to preserve and protect them the department of the interior in cooperation with the united negro college fund has launched a project to preserve these structures in 1988 a special survey to identify candidates for inclusion in this program generated responses from 46 hbcus nominating 144 structures for consideration the department and uncf eventually selected 11 of the most historically significant and critically threatened structures on such campuses the department and uncf estimate that it will cost 20 million to preserve these particular structures and uncf has agreed to match a departmental contribution of 10 million for this purpose under the hbcu historic preservation initiative however no funds were requested or appropriated for this purpose for fiscal year 1994 h r 2921 as reported by the committee on natural resources authorizes the use of appropriations from the historic preservation fund to provide grants for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at eligible hbcus in fiscal year 1995 a total of 20 million would be authorized 5 million of which may be used only for fisk university and 10 million of which may be used only for grants to those hbcus identified for inclusion in the interior

places must be matched equally unless the secretary determines that an extreme emergency exists or that such waiver is in the public interest the bill as amended also stipulates that structures receiving federal funds may be altered later only with the concurrence of the secretary these structures represent the hopes and achievements of a group of people denied equal opportunity and justice and who succeeded despite the imposition of almost insurmountable legal and social obstacles in many cases the buildings were constructed by the students themselves many of them former slaves and came under constant attack particularly during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s as symbols of africanamerican pride and progress national park system resources representing africaffamerican themes are notably scarce these institutions provided the only avenue to a better life for many africanamericans and provided this country with some of its greatest leaders including many current members of congress the inadequacy of the africanamerican theme representation in the national park system makes this program to recognize the importance of hbcus to our nation critical

1977 remains available until appropriated of the funds appropriated for historic preservation through the hpf the amounts cited in this bill may be used for preservation specifically at hbcus this bill does not authorize new spending but allows already authorized funds to be spent on these significant and underfunded resources the testimony received at the hearing from the many presidents of hbcus provided moving and eloquent affirmation of the significance of these resources and their importance to the africanamerican experience many of our colleagues have expressed strong support for this legislation and several were able to attend the hearing and voice powerful personal confirmation of the education and cultural values represented by these structures with enactment of this

indeed have a future im happy to say that several members of this body have joined me in this call of support for our children the families and children of america are suffering and we cannot rescue one without saving the other as a noted child advocate has said and i quote it a community values its children it must cherish their parents my colleagues the care and nurturing of our families and children must become a national priority it is no longer acceptable to pay lip service to this issue not when 22 percent of all childrenmore than 1 out of 5live in poverty as a woman of color i cannot in good conscience keep silent when i know that more than half of those children 55 percent to be exactare africanamerican or hispanic in this land where the american dream still looms large as the one thing for which we should all strive there are people who toll at hardlabor every day of the week and only to find themselves still below the poverty level almost 12 percent of the families in this rich nation of ours make up the working poor and again for families of color the figure doubles to over 25 percent members of the house it is meanspirited and disgraceful that we continue to allow these conditions to exist there are those members in this body who would vote against any initiatives to help families and children while at the same time professing a deep love and devotion to our nation and this democracy to those members i say this is a shortsighted and hypocritical way to do business if you want to prove your allegiance to america then do it by standing up for those who will lead her into the 21 century members of the conference committee will have the opportunity to do that over the next few days as the budget reconciliation bill takes shape the measure that was approved by the house held four provisions that would put both our children and our families first those programs are childhood immunization earned income tax credit the mickey leland hunger program and the family preservation and support program i ask the members of the house for their continued support for these programs lets start with the immunization program dont let anybody tell you that parents can get their children immunized if they simply would make the effort to do it the numbers dont support that myth right now the rate of immunization against deadly childhood diseases in this country is a measly 55 percent how can we look ourselves in the mirror and say its ok for 55 000 children to be crippled or killed by a preventable disease like measles it happened in 1991 and will most certainly happen again how can we simply stand by and allow polio mumps rubella and meningitis to take this terrible toll on our children i submit to you that we cannot and before you tell yourself that the vaccines are available to everyone so we really dont need to do anything about this problem let me quickly tell you that the cost of immunizing a child jumped from 11 in 1977 to 133 in 1992 its called an economic deterrent many low and middleincome families who lack health insurance simply cant afford the service included in the house reconciliation legislation is a universal vaccine assurance system which would serve 11 1 million children who are now currently uninsured or underinsured medicaideligible or native american in north carolina 290 000 children would receive vaccinations 116 000 more than are currently eligible under medicaid i argue that providing vaccines for children is not only the morally right thing to do it is also fiscally sound let me remind my colleagues that 1 spent on immunizations now saves at least 10 in treatment down the road to sum it up briefly we can pay the bill now or pay it later the choice is ours with the issue of hunger i make the same plea we can provide children with the proper nutrition to grow strong bodies and healthy minds now or pay the consequences later the mickey leland food stamp provisions are critical to addressing the grievous problem of hunger the nationwide community childhood hunger identification project released in 1991 reported that 5 5 million american children under age 12 are hungry this means 1 out of every 12 furthermore an additional 6 million children find themselves in families that are at risk of hunger because sometimes these families in order to pay their utility bills in the winter can not afford to buy food these figures are astonishing in light of the abundance that we find in american agriculture onehalf of the recipients of food stamp benefits are children while 80 percent of the benefits in the program go to families with children put simply the food stamp program is the frontline of defense for preventing hunger in america over 96 percent of the benefits go to people at or below the poverty line most58 percentgo to households that are so poor that their income does not exceed half of the poverty line we must not accept hunger as a standard in this country the mickey leland provisions of the reconciliation bill speak to the problem of hunger by providing basic subsistence to those who are in desperate need i deeply urge my colleagues to support the efforts of individuals like the late mickey leland who died while attempting to address the deplorable conditions faced by the hungry on the african continent after we have fed our children and provided for their health we must help empower their working parents to lift themselves out of poverty that is the goal of the earned income tax credit program currently about 5 million americans work 40hour weeks and still remain below the poverty line it is a disgrace that individuals in america can work full time and never rise out of poverty in the house reconciliation bill families with two or more children that earn up to 8 500 a yearwhat fulltime minimum wage work now pays would receive a wage supplement to bring them to the poverty line i believe that an expanded eitc is essential to reward work and pave the way for welfare reform further the eitc would be of great benefit to low and moderate income working families in north carolina some 485 000 working families with children in north carolina received the fjtc in 1992 the expanded eitc program in the house passed reconciliation bill would have ensured that those workers with families and childless workers were brought up to the poverty line this is especially important in light of the increasing tax burden on the poor without an expanded eitc program which includes childless workers we will be taxing those poorest among us deeper into poverty i urge all members to show their support for this program especially to the finance committee of the senate and the ways and means committee of the house to work for its inclusion in the conference report finally i ask that my colleagues on the conference committee pay special attention to the family preservation and supportprovision contained in the housepassed reconciliation legislation last year 2 9 million children an average of about 8 000 a day were reported abused and neglected more than three children a day died of maltreatment the 1 5 billion included in the house package would help prevent this neglect and abuse and possibly offset more expansive social service programs by providing funds for family support programs that teach parents early how to protect nurture and support their children the funding will help states develop and expand programs for families in crisis to help keep children and parents together and will improve the quality of foster care for those children who cannot be protected at home the senate did not include the family preservation and support program in its version of the budget reconciliation legislation it is my sincerest hope that my house colleagues will prevail with the house provisions today we have the opportunity to tell the world that america values its children and families above all other things that we respect the sanctity of the family unit and will do all we can to support and encourage families to stay together and work for their goals with a vote for the initiatives i have outlined this evening we can begin to erase the social deficits that have plagued our society for more than two decades my dear colleagues let us begin today to secure americas future i yield to the

idea but anyhow mr lasater was a very close friend of the presidents and was one of his big financial supporters mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the

consume in terms of the debate today on the balanced budget amendment i would like the members of the house to focus just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily because this continuous spending spree is about to sink this country into debt

d5 missile we therefore need 240 d5 missiles to go in the 24 tubes on each of these 10 submarines that constitutes the requirement of 240 d5 missiles if they are to be outfitted with the missiles for which they were designed now one facile solution which the supporters of this amendment may suggest is we have got plenty of c4 missiles the older missile now on the existing trident boat i ask why dont we take them and simply stick them in the tubes of these 10 trident submarines the answer simply is they dont fit their length their width their total dimensions are such that they do not fit and it would require that these boats be taken back to their manufacturer in brighton ct and completely rebuilt at a cost of at least 400 or 500 million per boat an exorbitant cost second in addition to the 240 missiles we need to fill the tubes on these ten trident submarines we have a requirement still remaining of 11 missiles to be used for certification to make certain that this missile can perform according to its specifications thirtyfive originally were required for this purpose it is now down to 11 additional missiles so we need these for certification and i might add that this is not some simple requirement because we have learned things from the testing and certification of this system that have been important to its development and deployment finally we need 138 missiles for life cycle testing now what does this mean we assume that the trident boats will have a life of 23 years they actually have a life of more than 23 years but the utility of this missile we are assuming to be 23 years and we are assuming that we will take six missiles every year and test that means of the 10 boats 6 boats will be doing one test one missile firing a year that is the minimum necessary to keep proficiency in the crew so that they understand the flight system the navigation system the control system it is the minimum test to make sure that we understand this system it is also the minimum test to maintain confidence in the d5 missile that means that about every other year a trident submarine crew will be going to sea and firing one missile that is what we are providing for here 240 to go in the tubes 138 to test 11 to complete the certification that brings us to 389 missiles that has been pared back considerably from last year and i think that point ought to be made we have

circumstances should epa attempt to seek a future supplemental based upon the 475 4 million authorization contained in 1994 but they do gain flexibility out of this which hopefully will aid them in

agencies have seen such an increase in their budget nasas budget for example was increased a mere 1 9 percent over last years figure second many increases sought by the administration in fiscal year 1994 are not for core research programs many of the increases requested by the administration will not remain in the office of research and development but will pass through to other offices of epa to the commerce department to the office of science and technology policy in the white house among other agencies there are lots of us on both sides of the aisle i think who believe that if these funds are not to remain within the office of research and development that then they will not be used to support the core research programs that are most in need of funding i know that there is bipartisan
