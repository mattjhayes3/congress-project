casualties is long a patients bill of rights campaign finance reform medicare prescription drug benefits smaller class sizes and sensible gun safety reform is also being killed since the columbine tragedy occurred more than 6 months ago the republican leadership has consistently stifled every attempt to pass common sense gun safety measures and yet 13 children every day are killed by guns with

government operating but i deeply regret that we have reached this point and i am deeply disappointed by what has happened to americas education priorities in the last 72 hours on sunday night after 3 days of no negotiations republicans met facetoface with democrats on a good faith basis to resolve our differences on education democrats asked republicans whether they had full authority to negotiate a final deal and they answered yes in an example of bipartisan compromise both sides came together and both sides sought common ground negotiators toiled late into the evening each side made concessions as must be done in a bipartisan compromise and consensus was reached through sensible dialogue i give great credit to the gentleman from florida and i give great credit to the gentleman from wisconsin and the senators who were involved the bill that came out of that room was a bipartisan bill that would have lifted up every community and every school in this country this bill included full funding for 100 000 new teachers teacher training afterschool programs and a billion dollars for school repair and school modernization less than 12 hours after the agreement was reached the leaders of the republican party ripped this deal apart as a favor to a business lobby the republican leadership bowed to business lobbyists who according to the washington post were making and i quote urgent calls to the hill to try to block this compromise simply because they did not like worker safety provisions that protected workers from repetitive stress injuries this republicanled congress scuttled a bipartisan agreement that would have provided local districts with the means to hire new teachers and build new classrooms so that we could get smaller classroom sizes so that our children could be better educated i guess it is not a surprise because republican leaders have spent the last 6 years frustrating americas agenda a bipartisan agenda by giving in to special interests on every one of these issues the republican leadership has taken the side of the special interests over americas agenda we tried to get an affordable effective prescription medicine program we forced it on to the agenda with the help of republican members and it was scuttled in conference and it is not going anywhere because i guess the pharmaceutical companies did not want it we worked with republicans to force on to the agenda of this house an effective and enforceable patients bill of rights and it has been stifled in a conference committee because i guess the insurance companies did not want it we could have had targeted tax cuts for college and longterm care and child care but instead we passed huge tax cuts for the top 1 percent of americans instead of getting something done in a bipartisan way that we could have gotten done we fought for sensible gun safety legislation but it is stifled in a conference committee i guess as a favor to the national rifle association we have tried to get a sensible increase in the minimum wage but it too is stifled even though it has strong bipartisan support we forced on to the agenda of this house campaign finance reform which is desperately desired by the people of this country and it too passed by a bipartisan vote in this house and it has been stifled in a conference committee there is a pattern here there is a pattern bipartisan efforts which even passed by bipartisan votes on the floor are being held hostage by the special interests of this country and by the republican leadership that is running this congress the speaker said 2 years ago that the trains were going to run on time and that we would finish our budget in regular order well it is 4 weeks into the fiscal year we are 6 days away from a general election and we have not gotten the work done that we could have gotten done if the leadership of this congress would have simply let the bipartisan majority that was trying to break out and do these things to be able to do them and as a result we have a dysfunctional congress we have an ineffectual congress education is our most important priority we have schools with cracked walls and no airconditioning and leaky windows we have cornices falling off of buildings we have kids in temporary structures in movable classrooms in inadequate facilities in the wealthiest nation on earth our

cuts more than 1 billion from critical health programs and next week we will be forced to vote on this bill that undermines so many of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2

education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50 billion per year when fully phased in this monstrous hole in the federal budget will undoubtedly translate into cuts from areas that the american people care about just as the proposed 175 billion republican tax cut translated into cuts in yesterdays proposed labor hhs education appropriations bill when we prioritize tax cuts over health education and labor we make sacrifices and these sacrifices affect everybody the repeal of the estate tax does nothing for working families most american families would not receive a single dollar of tax relief from this bill so i want the american people to know what they are sacrificing in order to provide a tax cut to the wealthiest two percent of their fellow citizens

of sacrifices that americans are being asked to make in exchange for a tax cut that would give 300 billion to the 400 richest americans 300 billion is enough to pay for a prescription drug benefit for seniors for 10 years the republican majority placed the needs of big business over working people yesterday by voting to once again delay the implementation of new ergonomics regulations which protect working people from repetitive motion injuries and here they are again asking working families to make sacrifices so that the wealthy can reap benefits slowing our progress in health education and

eliminate the marriage tax penalty many of us over the last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is

what this is all about the republican bal anced budget sets aside 100 percent of the social security trust fund payroll taxes and interest on the trust fund for social security and medicare the president only wants to set aside 62 percent because he wants to spend 38 percent of social security on other things it is about spending the republican balanced budget sets aside 2 2 trillion over

i represent in chicago in the south suburbs is the issue of fairness particularly tax fairness people are frustrated that taxes are so high but they are also frustrated how complicated they are and

anywhere else for the record i would suggest that the american ambassador should warn those public officials concerned that if those antisemitic statements do not end there will be some action taken by the united states and that if they repeat these antisemitic statements perhaps the american ambassador should act to ensure that these public officials not receive any visas to the united states i

make sure that the evil elements in their society do not get the upper hand there is a good way to determine who an evil element is in a society certainly it is easy to tell when you see those are the people who are making antisemitic and racist and hatefilled remarks and trying to build animosity from one group to another based on their race their religion or their ethnic background if russia is to be part of the civilized world then antisemitism cannot be part of the public officials dialog in that country if russia wants to be part of the western democracies and wants to build their country

countrys history but most americans do not know exactly what a raw deal it has been and was the fact is that black americans and their achievements quite often have been written out of the history books i love to read history and i have seen that in so many cases where black americans they pop up here and there but the average american has no idea that they have done such tremendous things just like today we are giving credit for people who have built this altar of liberty this altar of freedom for all america to see and there were black americans and to this point very few people knew there

think that criticism is valid but i think i know why that is the case too republicans are just so excited about the tax cuts that some of them forget to talk about the other vital elements of the budget proposal let us face it republicans were put on this earth to cut taxes we are the taxcutting party because we believe that people should have more power and control over their ownlives and that the gov ernment should have less let us be clear once and for all the republican budget proposal stands for saving social security and medicare paying down the national debt and yes also cutting
