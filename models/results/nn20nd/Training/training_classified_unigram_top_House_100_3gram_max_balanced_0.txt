it or to break a tieyou said that your votes were not reflective of your true feelings on national security and defense i said i am going to remember this conversation jim and i am going to remember

support of h r 4379 the temporary safe haven legislation we have before us today as a coauthor and cosponsor of this legislation i would like to give my colleagues a brief summary of the genesis of this bill and why i believe it is needed the bill before us today is an alternative to nationspecific legislation to allow foreign nationals to remain temporarily in the united states and an alternative to administration grants of extended voluntary departure evdi as my colleagues will recall tast year the judiciary committee and the 1i 96s5i house of representatives passed h r 618 legislation to stay deportation of salvadorans and nicaraguans pending a gao report i opposed this nationspecific legislation because i believed it was the wrong approach it gave foreign nationals from these two countries an opportunity to remain in the united states while foreign nationals from other countries in similar circumstances have no such opportunity the legislation before us would replace this nationspecific approach with a more evenhanded procedure for handling these cases this legislation also replaces the casebycase approach use by every administration during the past 25 years since 1960 the executive branch has used an administrative remedy known as extended voluntary departure evd to allow nationals of certain countries upon expiration of their vistls to remain in the united states when conditions in their home countries present a hwsard to their return at present individuals from poland ethiopia and afghanistan have this evd status however no criteriastatutory or otherwiseexists which specifies when extended voluntary departure can be granted and why certain countries qualify the legislation before us parallels numerous other examples where statutory framework establishes the criteria under which the executive department exercises its discretion to admit foreign national fhe refugee act of 1980 was passed by congress to establish a uniform process by which we accept refugeesthat is those individuals having a wellfounded fear of persecution based on race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion with the passage of the refugee act the use of extended voluntary departure decreased however even after passage of this act the administration continued to use its executive authority to grant extended voluntary departure in special circumstances for certain countries such as uganda poland ehtiopia and afghanistan another example is our preference system which defines categories of aliens which congress has decided are to be considered as immigrants the consular officer in the field reviews the applications for immigrant visas while the ins officer at ports of entry determines admissibility our law also provides for admission by asylum into the united states should a foreign national establish that he faces a wellfounded fear of persecution upon return to his own country the department of justice reviews these asylum applications and makes the necessary determinations on each case i sympathize with all countries around the world that suffer from economic hardship civil strife or national catastrophe however i think the present reliance on ad hoc use of evd and nationspecific legislation demonstrates a clear need for congressional action to establish formal procedures for granting temporary safe haven the purpose of the refugee act of 1980 was to establish a formal and orderly process for accepting refugees to supplant the use of parole and nationspecific procedure we need to do the same for evd i believe the bill under consideration makes much more sense than granting a stay of deportation for el salvador or nicaragua only pending completion of a gao report or granting administrative evd to polish nationals every 6 months ii r 4379 is a rational freestanding legislative approach to allow individuals here temporary refuge only until conditions in their country improves the bill before us today establishes the criteria for such action and replaces the current ad hoe approach it fills a gap between our refugee act and our immigration laws and deserves

resolution i rise in support of the first budget resolution i find it encouraging that we have begun debate on the fiscal year 1989 budget early and that we are likely to meet the first of our budget process deadlines fiscal year 1989 will be the 13th budget implemented under the procedures of the 1974 budget act when that act was passed the members of both houses expected the new budget process would make congressional decisionmaking more rational more efficient and less political how well will we do in fulfilling the expectations of the 93d congress as we go through the budget process in 1988 one of the expectations of the framers of the budget act was that the act would return the power of the purse to congress have we regained our control over the power of the purse i think not last year we could not and did not pass a budget until the stock market crash forced the administration to participate in a budget summit recently we have allowed the administration to frame the terms of our debate over the budget our budget cuts are estimated with reference to the presidents budget our revenue raising policies are developed in an atmosphere of concern over what will be approved at the other end of the avenue and this year there is a very real danger that we will allow the economic projections of the office of management and the budget a part of the executive branch to dominate those of the congressional budget office even if we believe that those projections are based on unrealistic expectations and flawed assumptions we dont even have to wait for the administration to seize our power of the purse we have passed legislationthe grammrudman hollings act and its 1987 amendmentto prevent ourselves from using that power we created a 2year budget agreement with the administration limiting our options on spending on defense nondefense programs and taxation we have the power to control the purse but we have continually delegated that power and we have tied our own hands to prevent ourselves from using that power the budget act was expected to enable congress to curb federal spending have we done that i think not outlays for fiscal year 1977 equalled 409 2 billion outlays in the presidents fiscal year 1989 budget will equal 1 09 trillion after adjusting for doubling of prices over that period outlays in the federal budget have increased 40 percent since the budget act was passed receipts in fiscal year 1977 were 355 6 billion receipts in fiscal year 1989as projected by ombwill be 964 7 billion in constant dollars there has been a 42percent increase in revenue burdens outlays for defense in fiscal year 1977 were 97 2 billion defense outlays in fiscal year 1989 will be 294 0 biliona real change in defense spending of 57 percent outlays for nondefense in fiscal year 1977 were 312 billion outlays for nondefense in fiscal year 1989 800 billiona real change of 34 percent subtracting out net interest payments nondefense outlays were 282 billion in fiscal year 1977 they will equal 648 billion in fiscal year 1989a real increase in spending of 20 percent the deficit in fiscal year 1989 will be 243 percent of the fiscal year 1977 deficit and net interest payments in fiscal year 1989payments for maintaining our national debtare five times as high as net interest payments in fiscal year 1977 it is quite clear that we have not curbed the growth in federal spending it was expected that the new budget process would allow congress to anticipate and avoid large and frequent federal deficits as i said the fiscal year 1989 deficit will be 21a times as large as the fiscal year 1977 deficit interest payments on the debt are increasing at a staggering pace and the national debtthe accumulation of the past federal deficitsis 3 times as high now as it was in 1977 we have not controlled deficits it was expected that the new budget process would allow congress to pass legislation necessary to budget creation in a timely and efficient fashion the last time we passed all 13 appropriations bills by october 1 was 1977 this past year we were required to pass four continuing resolutions in order to keep the government operating while we continue to deliberate and as we all know the budget legislation that finally became law was very large very late and the product of a few key negotiators last years budget exercise was not timely it was not efficient and it occurred without providing opportunities for discussion debate or amendment finally it was expected that the new budget process would take the politics out of the federal budget decision many hoped that providing independent economic information analyses to congress would allow us to address budget issues in a rational sensible manner instead we have been involved in deliberations that are less than that we have resorted to political games we have resorted to creative accounting we have resorted to wishful thinking we have resorted to threats coercion and stubbornness we have not seen even one of the improvements of the new budget process come to be and now we face another round in the same processa round that has been further complicated by the amendments to the improved process further complicated by a sluggish economy and the twin deficits of trade and the budget further complicated by a binding agreement made between the legislative and executive branches to cap spending regardless of the state of the economy and regardless of the needs of the american people i understand the events that lead to the passage of grammrudmanhollings i understand the events that lead to the budget summit last winter while i might have done things differently i am willing to abide by those agreements and to work to reduce the deficit and create a budget that is realistic responsible and humane i believe that many of my colleagues in both houses of congress are genuinely concerned over the budget the deficit and our future actions i believe that many of them would also be willing to work toward a rational budget for fiscal year 1989 but i am afraid that even this expectation will not be fulfilled i am afraid that this year will be the biggest political game yet and the game this time will be more deadly than ever last week the ways and means committee held hearings on the presidents fiscal year 1989 budget with a special focus on the economic assumptions underlying the outlays budget authority and revenue requests i believe those assumptions are a product of wishful thinking if we believe omb then we believe that real gnp will grow at a rate of 3 5 percent in 1989 the congressional budget office disagrees every other projection of growth for 1989 that i have seen falls in the range of 2 to 2 5 percent according to a recent article in the new york times the recent improvement in unemployment which has led to higher growth is more fragile than many of us realize it is true that the current economic recovery created new jobs but many of those new jobs are being filled with temporary workers who are paid no benefits are paid less and can be laid off quickly if the economy turns down again the dependence on temporary workers allows businesses to adjust quickly to a weakening economy but also can cause the national unemployment rate to rise far more quickly than it did during the 1982 recession according to cbo a 1percentagepoint increase in the unemployment rate would lead to a 35 billion decrease in revenues and a 7 billion increase in federal outlays the change in the deficit would be an overall increase of 42 billion dollars yet i am afraid that we will succumb to the temptation to believe ombs estimates of unemployment and gnp growth even though they have been called unduly optimistic we will succumb because an optimistic forecast serves our political purposes if we are realistic if we are responsible we will have to find at least 7 billion in spending cuts or new revenues beyond what are almarch 23 1988 ready required to fulfill the budget summit agreement if we believe omb then we believe that interest rates on 90day tbills will fall to 5 2 percent in 1989 the congressional budget office disagrees other interest rate projections fall in the range of 6 5 to 7 percent yet we will be tempted to accept the optimistic omb forecast because the 1 5percentagepoint difference in the interest rate will force us to find 15 to 17 billion more in spending cuts or new revenues to pay for the higher outlays on interest on the debt if we believe omb we believe that inflation will be approximately 3 9 percent in 1989 the congressional budget office disagrees they project inflation at 4 9 percent higher inflation will increase our revenues but will also increase our outlays and negatively affect private domestic investment the net effect of the difference in inflation rate projections leads cbo to project a 2 billion higher deficit than does omb again those 2 billion will have to come from somewhere in all cbos economic assumptions have lead them to project that the deficit in 1989 will be 25 to 30 billion higher than the deficit projected in the presidents budget i ar n not faulting omb for their projections i realize that economics is not an exact science and that modeling the macroeconomy is a difficult inexact process i also realize that cbo may be wrong their estimates may be unduly pessimistic we wont know who was right until 1989 is over even then we may never know just how accurate those forecasts were since the economy responds to our budgetary policies and exogenous shocks if we do not implement the policies recommended in the presidents budget then omb can rightfully claim that any errors can be attributed to changes in federal budget policy which were not incorporated in those forecasts i do not expect omb to be perfect in their forecasts but i hope that we can resist the temptation to join them in their optimism and instead take the more difficult but more rational road of working with the highest deficit estimate now a choice lies before us omb has provided us with a justification to play down the deficit to work with a lower deficit estimate i know all of us know that finding the cuts necessary to implement the budget summit will be painful it would be nice to underestimate the deficit at this stage it would be nice to agree with omb and hope that the august snapshot wont find us 5 or 10 or 20 billion short in reaching the deficit reduction that will avoid sequestration agreeing on the budget under ombs projections will be hard enough why should we make it harder for ourselves by accepting more pessimistic projections we need to make it harder on ourselves now because we will have to address the issue in a realistic manner someday if cbo is wrong if the private forecasters are wrong the result will be that come august we will find that we cut too much we saved too much we raised more revenue than we really had to i have to tell you that i personally would enjoy being in that position it would be nice to be able to say to the american people guess whati we made a mistake we are going to have to give you back some taxes we are going to have to spend a little more without raising the deficit we are going to have to retire some of that multitrilliondollar debt its tough to admit our mistakes but i know that everyone in this house would be happy to take the consequences of that error the alternative is to cut less now and cut more later raise less revenues now and raise more revenues later the biggest differenceand i believe this is criticalis that postponing those decisions until august will give us less time to find the cuts and find the revenues it will give us less time to debate explore and amend it will give us less time and our experience with the budget during last winter should be enough to convince everyone here that time is something we badly need if we are to produce a responsible rational budget"], [9.906291961669922e-05, 0.4999009370803833, 0, "i think that is important because that is really the response to the gentleman from california because
