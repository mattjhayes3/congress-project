and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be satisfied with the amount of money

the repeal of the estate tax does nothing for working families most american families would not receive a single dollar of tax relief from this bill so i want the american people to know what they are

disappointed by what has happened to americas education priorities in the last 72 hours on sunday night after 3 days of no negotiations republicans met facetoface with democrats on a good faith basis to resolve our differences on education democrats asked republicans whether they had full authority to negotiate a final deal and they answered yes in an example of bipartisan compromise both sides came together and both sides sought common ground negotiators toiled late into the evening each side made concessions as must be done in a bipartisan compromise and consensus was reached through sensible dialogue i give great credit to the gentleman from florida and i give great credit to the gentleman from wisconsin and the senators who were involved the bill that came out of that room was a bipartisan bill that would have lifted up every community and every school in this country this bill included full funding for 100 000 new teachers teacher training afterschool programs and a billion dollars for school repair and school modernization less than 12 hours after the agreement was reached the leaders of the republican party ripped this deal apart as a favor to a business lobby the republican leadership bowed to business lobbyists who according to the washington post were making and i quote urgent calls to the hill to try to block this compromise simply because they did not like worker safety provisions that protected workers from repetitive stress injuries this republicanled congress scuttled a bipartisan agreement that would have provided local districts with the means to hire new teachers and build new classrooms so that we could get smaller classroom sizes so that our children could be better educated i guess it is not a surprise because republican leaders have spent the last 6 years frustrating americas agenda a bipartisan agenda by giving in to special interests on every one of these issues the republican leadership has taken the side of the special interests over americas agenda we tried to get an affordable effective prescription medicine program we forced it on to the agenda with the help of republican members and it was scuttled in conference and it is not going anywhere because i guess the pharmaceutical companies did not want it we worked with republicans to force on to the agenda of this house an effective and enforceable patients bill of rights and it has been stifled in a conference committee because i guess the insurance companies did not want it we could have had targeted tax cuts for college and longterm care and child care but instead we passed huge tax cuts for the top 1 percent of americans instead of getting something done in a bipartisan way that we could have gotten done we fought for sensible gun safety legislation but it is stifled in a conference committee i guess as a favor to the national rifle association we have tried to get a sensible increase in the minimum wage but it too is stifled even though it has strong bipartisan support we forced on to the agenda of this house campaign finance reform which is desperately desired by the people of this country and it too passed by a bipartisan vote in this house and it has been stifled in a conference committee there is a pattern here there is a pattern bipartisan efforts which even passed by bipartisan votes on the floor are being held hostage by the special interests of this country and by the republican leadership that is running this congress the speaker said 2 years ago that the trains were going to run on time and that we would finish our budget in regular order well it is 4 weeks into the fiscal year we are 6 days away from a general election and we have not gotten the work done that we could have gotten done if the leadership of this congress

president who gave our country the biggest tax increase in history has now vetoed meaningful tax relief for all americans why because bill clinton and al gore want to go on a spending spree that is what this is all about the republican bal anced budget sets aside 100 percent of the social security trust fund payroll taxes and interest on the trust fund for social security and medicare the president only wants to set aside 62 percent because he wants to spend 38 percent of social security on other things it is about spending the republican balanced budget sets aside 2 2 trillion over the next several years to pay down the national debt 200 billion more than the president calls for why bpcause the president wants to spend more our balanced budget takes onequarter out of every dollar for tax relief in fact over the next 5 years we pay down 861 billion of the national debt while providing 156 billion in tax relief one of the biggest concerns i often hear in the district that i represent in chicago in the south suburbs is the issue of fairness particularly tax fairness people are frustrated that taxes are so high but they are also frustrated how complicated they are and how unfair they are i have often asked this question is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes i happen to have with me today a photo of a couple from joliet illinois two public school teachers michelle and shad hallihan who by the way just had a baby boy named benjamin just the other day they are celebrating the birth of that child they are a typical couple that pays the marriage tax penalty my friends on the other side they call michelle and shad a special interest because we are trying to help them but these are folks who suffer the average marriage tax penalty and 1 400 is a lot of money in joliet illinois it is 1 years tuition at a local community college several months worth of day care it is real money for people like michelle and shad hallihan now president clinton says he would much rather spend their money here in washington because he could do it better than they can that is really what this issue is all about do we spend michelle and shads money or do we eliminate that marriage tax penalty of course the president vetoed that effort to eliminate their marriage tax penalty today if my colleagues think about it their little boy benjamin just born just in the last few weeks if they were able to take advantage of the education savings account tax relief that was included in this which would allow them to set up to 2 000 a year in a special account for benjamins education h8620 co michelle and shad if we were to eliminate their marriage tax penalty could put that marriage tax penalty into that account and in 18 years be able to pay for much of benjamins college education that is a choice we are making here today do we follow president clintons lead and spend it here in washington or do we let michelle and shad callahan keep it by eliminating the marriage tax penalty that is what we should be doing"], [0.0002640333550516516, 0.0002640333550516516, 0, "i rise in strong support of this rule and in strong support of our efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty many of us over the last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is 3 000 diapers for little ben the marriage tax

constituents during the district work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools let us lower the tax burden for the middle class let us secure retirement by strengthening medicare and social security"]],

gentleman from indiana the gentleman along with a lot of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have remained strong on these trade issues to make sure that we continue to have jobs for all of our working americans now the big highlight of the year i think was the fact that a previous bill offered by the gentleman from indiana came to this floor and had 289 votes and unfortunately it did not get past the procedures of the senate but it showed the whole nation working men and women that in fact we can stand together and the stand up for steel campaign which was supported by the unions and also by the companies and by many members of the house showed that we even though it did not pass the senate that we can keep this issue focused and we can win for our workers it put a lot of pressure and helped to stop some of the hemorrhaging of the loss of our jobs but house resolution 298 goes even beyond that it is not just an issue for steel it is an issue for many many products and it is an important issue for our country effective antidumping and countervailing duty laws are the cornerstone of an open market policy those who want to maintain free trade had better realize that any amount of trade we have should be fair trade and that maintaining trade depends on maintaining fair trade antidumping rules are designed to ensure that exporters based in countries with closed markets do not abuse other countries open market policies american industries which have benefited from these laws include basic industrial goods chemicals and pharmaceuticals advanced technology products consumer goods such as tomatoes oranges freshcut flowers cosmetics the present countervailing duty rules are and have come about as a result of the wto uruguay round 1964 to 1994 negotiations and they applied to all the members the wto agreement on countervailing duty measures defines the term subsidy the definition contains three basic elements a financial contribution by a government or any other public payment which confers a benefit all three of these elements must be satisfied in order for a subsidy to exist the scope of the negotiations at the seattle round discussions of the wto was specified during the uruguay round however some countries and this is the danger are seeking to circumvent the agreed list of negotiating topics and reopen the debate over the wtos antidumping and antisubsidy rules these rules have scarcely been tested since their enactment and certainly have not proven defective accordingly avoiding another series of divisive fights over these rules is the best way to promote progress on the other issues facing the wto therefore it is essential that negotiations on these antidumping and antisubsidy matters not be reopened at the seattle round of discussions of the wto house resolution 298 simply says we have a system let it work to reopen these rules at the seattle round is not only dangerous to the united states but most importantly it is dangerous to the

a great difference now i do not deny that there is merit in additional gun laws i think we can do some more things i think we are on the verge of doing that i think the bill that passed the senate was an excellent one but for one aspect of it and that is the gun show aspect i believe and we believe there was some unreasonable aspects to that and that is a sticking point that we have been working on and working on and working on but i want to remind the gentlewoman i do not know how many young people were killed in automobile accidents in the period of time that she had reference to with guns but i daresay more people were killed in automobile accidents that does not mean we should stop people driving but it is just a fact of life sixteen federal laws were violated at littleton sixteen nine state laws were violated so what is our response let us heap another law on the fire but look i am for it notwithstanding the futility perhaps of another law i am working to get one but i am just suggesting to the gentlewoman these are not easy and the senate operates differently than we do i think it took the vice presidents vote to get that bill out happily he cannot vote in this body but we are doing our best if the gentleman would continue to yield i would just like to comment on the gun show loophole because i know my good colleague the gentlewoman from new york has been a leader on that and i just do not understand why that issue is so difficult when we know that 90 percent of the people are cleared"], [7.146596908569336e-05, 0.5000714659690857, 0, "i yield myself such time as i
