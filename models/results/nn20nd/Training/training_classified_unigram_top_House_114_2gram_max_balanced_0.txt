have a responsibility to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands the shooting in orlando was the largest mass shooting in our countrys history this is a moment of truth and we cannot have another moment of silence without some action we are pleading with the speaker of the house and we are pleading with our republican colleagues to allow us to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor for consideration so that we can debate them and vote on them one is the no fly no buy legislation if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane because you are on the terrorist watch list according to the fbi then you are too dangerous to buy a gun it shouldnt be controversial the second is to eliminate the loopholes in our background check system which says that you have to go through a background check if you go to a licensed gun dealer but that you can get around that by going to a gun show or by buying a gun online overwhelming numbers of democrats and republicans according to the latest public opinion polls think both of these ideas are smart commonsense approaches the only thing that is standing in the way is the republican leadership in this house please schedule these bills for a vote no we will not be satisfied with the nra bill that you want to bring to the floor this week that basically is nothing but a press release but will not keep guns out of the hands of people who are suspected of being terrorists i hope that we can reach some sort of accomodation with our republican friends we are not going away this issue is too important and it is about time we acted silence and

had complete control of congress and the white house the american people saw what liberals would pass when given free rein and a blank check with doddfrank democrats deemed it necessary to punish small community banks with burdensome regulations they cannot afford to comply with doddfrank created a new unaccountable bureaucracy called the cfpb which is funded in a way that obscures its transparency and prevents congress direct oversight of the agency the lack of accountability like that seen with the cfpb and the heavy hand of agencies like the epa and the irs have become hallmarks of this administration with the stimulus bill democrats gave handouts to their union and socalled green energy friends taxpayers were on the hook for loan guarantees to companies like solyndra which used its political connections in the white house to push through irresponsible loan approvals when solyndra went bankrupt it was at the cost of the american people many other smaller boondoggles came out of the stimulus silly studies on ducks over 1 million on road signs that promote the stimulus and over 3 million for a tunnel for turtles in florida this leaves obamacare too many americans have felt the negative consequences of what boils down to a government takeover of the healthcare industry the president claimed this law would decrease premiums by 2 500 per year instead they have risen since obamacare has been enacted to go with the increase in cost many americans have seen a sharp decrease in their choices there are fewer plans available restricting the ability of hardworking families to choose coverage that is appropriate for their circumstances taken together this trio of liberal policies is adding layers of bureaucratic red tape forcing americans to pay more for health

slowdowns in growth and not projected cuts down the roadhonesttogod cuts in spending since i took office in 2011 discretionary spending has been cut significantly by 434 billion but this does not address mandatory spending which is the real driver of our national debt this includes programs like food assistance welfare medicare medicaid social security and interest on our debt reforms are needed to ensure these programs work efficiently and are sustainable because of the way obamacare was written and enacted mandatory spending also includes large portions of obamacare funding mandatory spending is on autopilot and will continue with or without congress annual appropriations process the fact is we have to change the law that means both chambers of congress have to pass reforms and the president has to sign them or we have to override a veto mandatory spending accounts for threequarters of all money spent by the federal government this is a 180degree change from when i was a teenager when in 1970 mandatory spending was only about a third of government spending realistically there is only one path to a balanced budget and shrinking our national debt that path is to pass a budget and use a process called reconciliation a budget facilitates reconciliation which only requires a 51vote majority in the united states senate and avoids a filibuster by liberals who want to continue running up americas credit card not doing a budget forfeits the opportunity to do reconciliation reconciliation with mandatory spending program reforms coupled with real tax and regulatory reforms will send a strong signal to our entrepreneurs and businesses which will unleash innovation and the american spirit and will thus grow our economy and provide for our national defense a

this inequality the budget put forth by the congressional black caucus today attempts to rebuild and restore what we lost especially in the housing sector which is why it has my support first the cbc

to sequestration the cbc budget would also invest muchneeded resources to add over 20 000 new beds for the homeless across our country investments in these important rental and homeless assistance programs is especially important given the fact that we have nearly 8 million households in america for whom safe decent and affordable housing is not available to them put simply the republican

harder to buy a home absolutely almost impossible to send your children to college and certainly harder to enjoy a secure retirement house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again for every increase in the minimum wage it has been accompanied by an expanding economy house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio indicate that the gross domestic product will grow 1 5 trillion over 10 years this is a sorry track record of economic forecasting and therefore this budget is one that i have to oppose because it favors the wealthy over working class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose the

muster the courage to hold a vote on two proposals that are supported by roughly 90 percent of this country and that can save american lives the american people deserve to be heard they deserve a vote

is too dangerous to buy a firearm this week the majority will introduce a bill that pretends to close this gap in our homeland security laws but in reality it would create a system in which it is both legal and likely for suspected terrorists to buy a firearm the republican measure takes no fly no buy and turns it into no fly no problem under their proposal if a known or suspected terrorist attempts to buy a weapon they will be denied that ability for a mere 3 days from the moment they attempt to purchase that firearm the following things must happen all within 72 hours to prevent that purchase the attorney general must file a petition in federal court the court must schedule a hearing the suspect must be provided actual notice and the opportunity to appear at that hearing with a lawyer the court must rule on the petition and if all those things do not occur in 3 days the suspect is legally entitled to buy a weapon not only does the republican bill set an impossible timeline it also requires the justice department to meet an extremely high burden of proof a sale would only be prevented if the court finds probable cause that the suspect has committed or will commit an act of terrorism the republican proposal is specifically designed to ensure the justice department fails and the suspect is allowed to buy a gun it is a fig leaf to cover up the republicans refusal to take any meaningful action on gun violence it is no surprise that this bill is supported by the gun lobby instead of spending our time on toothless ineffective proposals we should vote on the original no fly no buy bill that will keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists we are also demanding a vote on a bipartisan proposal to require that commercial gun purchases include a background check background checks for all i have yet to hear one good explanation on why this should not be the law of the land if a dangerous person cannot pass a background check at a licensed gun dealer they

more than 34 000 lives have been cut short by someone using a gun the house of representatives has held 30 moments of silence for the victims of mass shootings since sandy hook and yet we havent taken a single vote on legislation that would help keep guns out of dangerous hands i think that is shameful the american people deserve more than silence the american people deserve a congress that is

walk out with a gun or the guns of their choosingand they can do it legally since 2004 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists were able to purchase guns more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon that they went in to buy now in the wake of the horrific attacks in orlando congress must make it a priority to keep deadly

end because we entered a new month we must remain focused on how we can bridge the divides in our society and how we can bring our nation closer together the divides are striking and we know them all too well the school to prison pipeline education disparities health disparities the injustices in our justice system it is well established in fact that students of color face harsher punishments in schools than their white peers leading to a higher number of youth of color in detention suspension and yes expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would not be able to afford college the disparities in access to health coverage are startling the infant mortality rate among african americans is 2 3 times that of nonhispanic whites and african american infants are four times more likely than nonhispanic white infants to die mostly due to complications related to birth weight we must confront these prejudices and these injustices in our nation headon the congressional black caucus is committed to resolving these challenges the

are part of health care plans under the affordable care act over 390 000 african american women in the individual market alone are projected to gain maternity coverage thanksyes thanksto the

consideration i remember it all too well a couple weeks before that when we were in that hearing room it looked like a sea of red as deltas marched in and lined up one after another wearing our colors crimson and cream deltas lined the outside of the hearing room we did that because prior to entering that room media and some of my colleagues on the other side had tried to make it a bad thing that she organized and was a founder of her college chapter of delta sigma theta sorority what we were able to do was to show them when we work together whether that is democrats and republicans or sorority members or nonsorority members when it is the right thing to do we can make a difference i was so proud last week to sit there on the front row with my other colleagueswith our chairman of

believe that our budget is a reflection of our values and is a moral document the house republican budget offers none of these in fact it slashes programs that support lowwage workers and people working hard to find a job these families shouldnt have to go hungry yet because their wages are so low they need food stamps by cutting 150 billion from snap this budget creates more hunger and more

bill that limits womens reproductive health rights the budget conference report was filed only minutes before the rules committee met yesterday only minutes before the committee formally convened it was a 100page conference report that was negotiated in secret by the republicans and it was brought before the rules committee before anybody had a chance to read it what ever happened to read the bill whatever happened to the pledge for a more open and transparent congress it would be nice if all members democrats and republicans had the opportunity to carefully review the legislation they are asked to vote on especially when it comes to a document that provides a blueprint for funding the federal government and reforming our social safety net programs if that werent bad enough the majority claims that this budget conference report is something to be proud of this is nothing to be proud of it is shameful it is shameful in terms of process and it is shameful in terms of substance budgets should be moral documents they provide our constituents with a clear picture of who we are of what our priorities are how we should govern where we want this country to go they represent our values but the values that this budget represents i would argue are not the values of working families in this country and they are not the values of those who are struggling to get out of poverty they may be the values of corporate special interests or of very wealthy individuals in this country but they dont represent the values of the majority of people in this country this partisan republican budget takes us in the wrong direction it cuts 5 5 trillion in funding through a series of unrealistic spending cuts math magic and gimmicks it asks nothing of the wealthiest among us proposes no elimination of special interest tax breaks and continues us down the terribly misguided path created by sequestration in fact to be honest this budget basically provides us a pathway to do not a lot of anything really we already know that unless we deal with the issue of sequestration our colleagues in the united states senate are going to block all of the appropriations bills we know that the president will not sign any appropriations bills that lock us into sequestration maybe what we should be doing rather than wasting time is fixing sequestration but my republican friends have been very good at wasting time and at wasting taxpayer dollars and that is what we are doing today the republican budget conference report proposes to end the medicare guarantee and turn it into a voucher program it turns medicaid and chip into a capped block grant it eliminates 85 million from pell grants it cuts investments in research and in infrastructure the budget resolution builds upon the draconian 125 billion cut to snap which is the nations premier antihunger program that was contained in the house budget to achieve a cut of that magnitude by block granting the program and capping its allotment means that states will be forced to cut benefits or kick eligible individuals and families off the program boy isnt that a nice value that we are promoting herethrowing poor people off of a food benefit just because the conference report is vague on some details or leaves out a few key buzzwords doesnt mean that it protects programs for the poor unfortunately this republican congress has shown time and time again that it plans to balance the budgets on the backs of the poor and working class americans the conference report also includes reconciliation instructions to repeal the affordable care act without proposing an alternative to ensure the 16 million people who have gained health coverage under the aca are able to remain insured that is right if the republicans get their way being a woman is once again a preexisting condition and preventative care goes away simply the progress that we have made over the past few years disappears senior citizens will see their prescription costs increase in budgetary terms we will be worse off when repealing the affordable care act because it will result in higher medical costs and sicker people it is just that simple it is a bad idea but it is a good sound bite i guess despite claims by my friends in the majority this budget does not balance it nowhere near balances in fact it is filled with gimmicks and contains the very dangerous addiction congress has for deficit spending by further increasing funds for the overseas contingency operations account or oco not only does this budget increase the ocos war spending but it also facilitates using the oco as a slush fund for items that should be funded in the base budget everything in oco is on the national credit card none of it is an emergency it is deficit spending pure and simple i commend my colleagues on the republican side who are raising a little hell about this kind of budget gimmick that is going on this is outrageous while we continue to pump up the deficit and to pump up the oco account we watch our roads and our bridges and our water systems crumble for lack of funding and we starve our education and our job training and innovation programs those are just a few of the outrages contained in the republican budget we are still in the process of combing through the 100page document that was just filed yesterday and i am sure there will be additional issues that we will want to raise in addition to this awful budget todays rule also provides for the consideration of h r 1732 and h j res 43 h r 1732 would basically force the epa and the army corps of engineers to withdraw its proposed rule on clean water act jurisdictional boundaries and start the rulemaking process over again from scratch the current rulemaking process should be allowed to move forward the epa and the army corps have painstakingly engaged in an extensive stakeholder outreach and public comment process they are doing their jobs the rule is grounded in sound science h r 1732 would cause further confusion and it would end up delaying essential clean water projects for future generations not to mention that a rider in the energy and water appropriations bill which is being considered by this house today would prohibit the army corps from spending any money to propose a new rule in one bill my friends basically null and void what the bill we are going to debate today is intended to do frankly i am disappointed in this partisan approach that the majority has taken with regard to clean water legislation and environmental protection legislation there is another bill in here and i just want to say a few words about that it is h j res 43 disapproving the district of columbia council in approving the reproductive health nondiscrimination amendment act the d c reproductive health nondiscrimination act is scheduled to take effect this saturday the law passed unanimously by the d c city council this would protect employees who work in the district of columbia from workplace discrimination based on their personal reproductive healthcare decisions the bill is about basic fairness people should be judged at work based on their performances not on their personal private reproductive healthcare decisions but house republicans cannot pass up an opportunity to meddle in personal reproductive decisions or in d c s right to govern itself the resolution before us h j res 43 would prevent the law from going into effect in doing so it would allow an employer to fire a woman because she used in vitro fertilization or to demote an employee because she used birth control pills or because her husband used condoms or to pay an employee less because his daughter became pregnant out of wedlock in other words we are a few months into 2015 a yearandahalf away from the presidential election and the republicans are already restarting their war on women sometimes it feels like this congress is stuck in the mindset of 1815 rather than 2015 let my colleagues make no mistake about this h j res 43 is about legitimizing discrimination enough already earlier the gentlelady from north carolina my colleague on the committee on rules came on

"would be a part of that history because if not for his presence i assure you we would not have passed this resolution in 2006 we went on to pass it in 2007 and it passed in the house with a vote of 4100 in 2008 it passed in the house of representatives by 4030 in 2009 by 4240 in 2010 by 4210 in 2010 of course and thereafter we stopped passing resolutions on the floor of the house although we may still present them and talk about them on the floor of the house so tonight this is what we will do i would like to mention the mission of the naacp which is to ensure the political educational social and economic equality of all personsnot just of black people not just of people of color but of all people the naacp also desires to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination these are lofty and noble goals because we understand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial discrimination in this country and the naacp took it upon itself to eliminate as much of it as possible it has done a good job i might add lets look at a little bit of the history of the naacp back on february 12 1909 a group of people decided that it was going to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in this country literally in this country between 1889 and 1918 thousands of african americans were lynchedthousands lynching was done with mob violence people were taken to trees and they were lynched it was done a good many times with impunity no one was ever prosecuted it was a grave injustice and there were people in this country who decided that they were going to do something about this injustice among the people who met initially were mary white ovington oswald garrison villard william english walling and ida wellsbarnett these persons met and issued a clarion call some 60 persons answered that call hence the naacp was born the naacp did not have its first african american as an executive secretary until 1920 it is important for us to note that many of the founders of the naacpin fact most of themwere not of african ancestry the first executive secretaries of the organization were all persons who were of european ancestry in fact the first five executive secretaries were white they were not black in 1934 the naacp had its first black board chairpersonlouis t wright dr wright became chairperson after the naacp had had a good number of white chairpersons so the naacp has never been and is not now an organization for blacks only the naacp has always stood for an integrated society and has been an integrated organization since its inception in 1954 the naacp under the leadership and counsel of the honorable thurgood marshall who became a justice of the supreme court won the lawsuit of brown v board of education this was a giant leap forward for us because this lawsuit integrated to a certain extent schools throughout the country the word that was appropriately used at the time was desegregated these schools were ordered to be desegregated with all deliberate speed and all deliberate speed can sometimes take a lot longer than one might expect a good many years later there are still those who would contend that we have not fully integrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the country in 1955 an naacp member the honorable rosa parks an african american lady decided that she was going to take a stand and she took that stand by taking a seat she took a seat on a bus in so doing she ignited a spark that started a civil rights movement by the way there are many people who contend that she did this because she was tired well she may have been tired but she did it because she wanted to take a stand she was tired of societys relegating her to the back of the bus and she took a stand against it hence we had the montgomery bus boycott which lasted more than a year at the end of that boycott the bus linethe transportation systemwas integrated in alabama and of course later on throughout the country an interesting note on this point about the integration and desegregation of bus lines there was a threejudge panel that actually heard the litigation associated with this transportation issue on that threejudge panel there were judges who had a great debate about this but there was one frank m johnson a federal district court judge who took the position that we could apply the brown decision to public transportation this was the very first time it was done was under the leadership of that threejudge panel and by the honorable frank m johnson again i point these things out because it is important to note that there were others who were there with the naacp to help us along the way frank m johnson by the way was a republican appointee who was appointed by president eisenhower and he went on to help us to integrate schools throughout the south and integrate the department of public safety he went on to help us with the facilitation of voting rights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons from discriminating against persons in workplace environments he really played a significant role as did many other persons who were associated with the naacp in a vicarious way because i dont have evidence of his having been a member i want to move forward if i may next to 2008 i move forward to 2008 because this is when the naacp supported the passage of the emmett till unsolved civil rights crime act of 2007 there are many unsolved cases in the history of this country with reference to things that happened to african americans the naacp pushed for and supported legislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the dastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing no harm to anyone the naacp has fought for this in 2009 the naacp celebrated its centennial anniversary and the theme at that time was bold dreams and big victories obviously a good theme because the naacp has won many big victories in 2012 the naacp supported the smart and safe campaign which brought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration in this country people who study these issues are well aware that in this country we have an overpopulation of persons who are incarcerated much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws much of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of one type of offense with drugs to receive a harsher penaltycocaine for example then if you have crack cocaine you will get a stiffer penalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine the point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many people to be incarcerated who quite frankly should not be incarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated some of these three strikes and you are out laws have also caused persons to go to prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third offense so the naacp is fighting against this"], [0.9819044210016727,
