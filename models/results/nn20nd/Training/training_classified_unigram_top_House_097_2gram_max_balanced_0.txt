essential part of the presidents plan to revitalize the american economy and i wholeheartedly endorse it according to a recent gallup poll a solid majority of the american public endorses it too my office has been deluged by calls telegrams and letters from taxpayers who know we cannot continue with yesterdays policies they know the federal tax burden has increased by 249 percent in the last 10 years of democratic leadership in the congress if current law remains unchanged the social security tax increases legislated during the carter years plus inflationinduced bracket creep will increase that burden by an additional 22 percent over the next 2 years the 15 percent individual tax rate reduction provided by the ways and menn f committee is therefore no reduction at all it will not even compensate for already scheduled tax increases the democrat tax reduction program is in reality a tax boost program for the average american worker under the provisions of the committee bill workers in almost every tax bracket will pay higher taxes in 1984 than they did in 1980 in contrast the conablehance tax reduction package will provide real relief for every american worker the 3year 25percent acrosstheboard marginal tax rate reduction will reverse the dangerous upward tax spiral of recent years it will provide the needed incentive for all americans to 115320 co work save and invest furthermore by indexing the tax rate structure to inflation the conablehance substitute will provide builtin protection against future tax increases caused by bracket creep and will protect and perpetuate the incentives provided by the plan on the business side the committee approved expensing method for depreciating capital expenditures will not provide adequate investment incentives to business in fact it may actually discourage investment in the shortterm because business will delay modernization and expansion until they are eligible to fully write off expenses in 1990 the accelerated cost recovery system proposed in the conablehance substitute in contrast both speeds up and simplifies depreciation schedules providing the incentives necessary to encourage both long and shortterm capital improvements coupled with better investment tax credits the bipartisan plan will encourage the investments necessary for a healthier more productive economy the conablehance plan will also spur innovation by reducing both capital and labor costs of new research and development enactment of the conablehance economic recovery tax act will mean increased productivity more jobs and a greater market share for american business at home and abroad in combination with tighter federal budgets regulatory reform and a stable monetary policy it will put our nation on a fundamentally different course this new course will lead to less inflation greater economic growth and a brighter future for all americans there should be no doubt that millions of americans insist we act favorably on this tax cut for the record i want to share further results of the gallup poll which speaks loudly to every member of congress here today 75 percent of the public favors a tax rate cut a solid majority 65 percent expects that a 30 percent cut in federal income tax rates over the next three years as originally proposed by president reagan will either reduce inflation or not have much effect on inflation americans believe by more than four to one that a 30 percent tax rate cut over the next three years will increase business investment and employment 73 percent of america thinks the amount of taxes the government collects is now a serious threat to basic economic liberties and of those favoring a tax rate cut 77 percent favor a 3 year approach over any other unquestionably we have a mandate from the taxpayers of this country for the conablehance substitute which nearly contains the reagan program in it entirety the economic genius of america can be unleashed once again to provide new jobs for orkers stable prices and a goverment we can afford i contend passage of conablehance is the best means to achieving tiat goal"], [3.298579031252302e-05, 3.298579031252302e-05, 0, "this is one of those votes that will not be won or lost by either of our political parties there are marked divisions on both sides of the aisle let us face it there is no mileage out there in raising taxes of any kind how many times have i said it takes no particular manly quality to be for tax reduction that is an easy vote the speaker corroborated that a few moments ago it is a lot tougher around here to be for expenditure reduction or to raise taxes if you have to do it now why do i come down on the side of supporting this conference report i have to build my case beginning with last years tax bill president reagen as i recall asked for 2 things 3 years of personal rate reduction 10 percent 10 percent 10 percent across the board 3 years in a row for all individuals in this country second more rapid depreciation writeoffs for business and industry that is all he asked for now admittedly he advocated some of the other changes but they would be added later what did he get not only the 3 years of personal rate reduction that totaled not 30 but 25 percent but a reduction on unearned income subject to tax from 70 to 50 percent in 1 year not 3 years indexing iras marriage penalty correction estate tax reduction reduction of capital gains from 28 to 20 percent reduction of corporate rate taxes from 48 to 36 percent utility dividend investment allsavers certificates safe harbor leasing and what have you now most of these are desirable but i wonder if we had o do it in retrospect all at once this tremendous loss of revenue so quickly was not commensurate with the kind of expenditure reduction that was possible to achieve around here and there is plenty of blame to go around when you consider them as individual spending reduction bills as a result the president was forced to submit a budget with an unacceptable deficit that almost everyone in this body decried on both sides of the aisle but we here in the congress reworked the budget our way and agreed after long tortuous hours on a budget resolution it passed this body by a very narrow margin if you recall and in it we called for that 21 billion of revenue to be raised in fiscal year 1983 to narrow the deficit now the skeptics did not think we would meet our reconciliation goals on expenditure reductions called for in that budget but we did it with that vote yesterday 96 percent of it the skeptics did not think we would meet our revenue goals either in an election year but here we are biting down hard on the bullet just to prove them wrong do you think that has not gone unnoticed by those smart money market managers i read the ticltr a while ago and the market is up by 9 points with 78 million shares traded i tell you they have been watching what we have been doing around here in the last week or 2 and have concluded that we really mean business we have beaten down inflation down to half the rate it was and interest rates finally seem to be responding to what we have been doing i am convinced personally the vote for this bill will reduce those interest rates further and that is the key element to full economic recovery defeat of this bill will surely mean a higher deficit mark that in your book we might very well expect interest rates to rise again if the bill goes down i have to say here in conclusion my friendsthat i have been in the congress now for 26 years would you believe it except for the social security tax increases and that temporary excise tax during the vietnam war that the speaker referred to i have never had to vote for a tax increase and federal revenues went from 78 billion when i come here in 1956 to what they are at 650 billion today how did it happen bracket creep inflation bracket creep inflation and who was the beneficiary big government tax moneys just kept rolling into the treasury i say that is why those personal rate reductions enacted last year are so important why the president has been so insistent that we have got to retain the third year of that tax reduction because that is the way the average citizen catches up with these other preferences some of which we are trying to correct today that principle has been preserved and indexing beyond 1985 has also been preserved if it holds in the future every time we want some big spending program we are going to have to toe the mark for the taxes to pay for the program i have been in the congress a quarter of a century as i said and have never had to vote for a tax increase like today but these are different times by voting for this bill we are not doing a flipflop i might say to the members on our side or turning our back on the principal thrust of what we began to do last year yes we are strengthening compliance yes we are making a few adjustments in our excesses of last year but the bottom line here is that passage of this bill will sill leave us with a net tax reduction from last years most comprehensive tax bill of 377 billion those are the facts may i say in conclusion it is good to have this bipartisan support we see manifested here today i urge members to vote for the conference report"], [3.4332275390625e-05,

of simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment as government must rely on private enterprise and the citizens of this nation to generate longterm real economic growth congress in turn must make a longterm commitment toward restoring the health of our economy the conablehance bill represents such a longterm commitment a guaranteed 3 year acrosstheboard tax rate cut rep resents a consistent

conablehance plan cut ~ marginal income tax rates by 25 percent acrosstheboard over 33 months providing real tax relief to all taxpayers although the conablehance proposal barely offsets this tax increase the committee bill falls far short the conablehanee bill offers a 3year 25 percent acrosstheboard tax cut for all taxpayers leaving our progressive tax code untouched the committees 2year 15percent tax cut claims to provide more tax relief to lower and middle income groups however a 3year 25percent reduction provides virtually the same amount of tax relief to low and middle income groups as a 2year targeted 15percent tax reduction for example under the committee bill households with 1980 income levels below 35 000 would be taxed at a rate only threetenths of 1 percent lower in 1983 than under the conablehance bill as the conablehance bill adopts indexcing it provides even more relief for this group than the committee bill does by making the tax cut permanent currently the middle class pays 72 percent of the federal tax burden the conablehance bill would give this same group 73 percent of the tax relief in terms of equity every income group shares in the tax reduction just as they shared in past tax increases instead of a policy of redistributing income which in the past has reduced incentives this evenhanded approach is designed to create new income by restoring growth to the economy creating new wealth is the surest way to create jobs and business opportunities for everyone our troubled economy today provides ample evidence of the destructive effect high tax rates have on an individuals incentive to work and save under the conablehance proposal individuals will have an additional incentive to work save and invest furthermore almost 90 percent of all businesses are operated as proprietorships partnerships and subchapter s corporations and therefore pay their taxes under personal rates these individual rate cuts constitute a major small business

achieve concrete and legitimate control over the growth in federal spending i feel that the latta substitute is the only alternative that does include meaningful control of the excess growth of entitlement programs and preservation of the personal income tax reform that is so necessary for reviving the economy it is important for the program for economic recovery to be given a chance to work many critics argue that having been given 11 2 years to work the program has failed this is simply not the case it is impossible for any initiatives to control runaway federal spending to undo damage done over a 40year period instantly when the program for economic recovery was passed by this congress this government was still on a 40yearold binge of overspending overtaxation and overregulation the debt service alone was larger than the entire 1963 budget and spending was still increasing at ever higher rates of increase every year to the point that the growth in federal spending was reaching a point of 17 percent per year contrary to the current wisdom the reductions in the federal budget did not represent an actual cut in spending levels rather the rate of increase in spending was reduced it is a fact that whatever budget is passed spending levels in real terms will be higher in 1983 than in 1982 but with the latta bipartisan substitute spending especially in the critical entitlement areas will have some substantial controls to prevent continued unrestrained increases we need to have a budget in place the latta substitute is far from what i consider the best budget possible it is however the best of the alternatives and cortains the important redeeming factor that will give us firm control on entitlement spending only the latta bipartisan substitute will provide

substantial departure from previous economic policies of higher spending and increased taxes last november 4 the american pcopole unmistakably recognized that it was these same policies which have led to sustained doubledigit inflation high unemployment and interest rates and a slowed national productivity growth i truly believe that unless we act now to change our past economic course these statistics based on the old policies of higher spending and taxation will continue to accumulate there are two very important reasons why i urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan substitute first it will restrain federal spenlding there can be no doubt that gloverment spending has literally exploded consider these facts payment of interest on the national debt for 1982 will almost equal the entire budget expenditures for fiscal year 1961 the national debt is more likely a national disgrace as it is currently just under 1 trillion washington presently spends 22 000 every second of every day in 1970 the government spent over 196 billion today we are considering a budget of 688 billion under the grammlatta substitute or roughly over 710 billion if all other proposed substitutes are considered by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute we will restrain federal spending to 6 1 percent in 1982 as compared to previous spending growth of 16 percent from 1979 to 1981 federal spending and revenues will decline to 19 3 percent of gnp by 1984 as opposed to 23 0 percent and 21 2 p~ercent presently for 1981 furthermore the grammlatta substitute proposes smaller spending levels than has been proposed by any of the other budget alternatives being considered by the house by at least 21 billion in fact spending by the grammlatta substitute is 6 5 billion smaller than spending proposed by the administration the important point is that by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute federal spending will still be larger than any prior year but it will be restrained many refer to the presidents proposal as cuttig the budget when actually all he is asking for is a reduction in the amount of increased spending for each year my second reason for supporting the bipartisan effort is that it leaves room for enactment of the reagan tax reform program which provides for sufficient tax relief to peopleespecially 97 million working peopleand to businesses the burden of taxes on individuals and businesses has become oppressive in 1965 only 6 percent of all taxpayers faced marginal tax rates of 25 percent or higher today almost40 percent of all taxpayers face rates of 25 percent or more the average worker must now pay his entire salary to taxes from january 1 to may 11 the previous administration estimated that tax receipts as a share of gnp would grow to the unprecedented level of 22 8 percent by 1984 ac cording to the house budget committee report page 31 in 1981 federal receipts are projected to exceed 21 percent for the first time since 1944 oliver wendell holmes jr once wrote the power to tax is the power to destroy the economic policies of the past several years have most certainly shackled american initiative and destroyed incentives to save work and investthe fundamentals of productivity the reagan tax plan relieves this tax burden first by keeping real taxes from increasing during the next few years and second by providing the necessary incentives to american workers and businesses to turn the economy around from a nogrowth situation to one of high growth president kennedy pointed this fact out in december of 1962 in a speech before the economic club of new york an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budgetjust as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits in short it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too lowand the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now in the same way the reagan tax plan will reinvigorate the economy by restoring incentives for savings invest ment and entrepreneurship and by renewing optimism and confidence just as the kennedy tax cuts of 1964 and 1965 did enactment of tax relief in this form recommended by the president will allow the private sector to grow rapidly enough to provide new jobs without contributing to inflation and will restore the ability of the united states to compete effectively in world markets ilet us give the american people the new beginning that they voted for and still overwhelmingly support the administrations measures as embraced

september 21 issue of newsweek by a diverse crew of instant analysts brokers eccnomists news writers offering divergent reasons for the monetary malaise which infests our economy and threatens the presidents economic recovery program although disagreeing on a number of factors the prevailing common ground which most of them shared was that the federal budget deficit is way out of sync more so inasmuch as a great share of wall street runs on psychology so what better way for the federal government to show its faith than to trim its deficit even further thereby lessening its grip on the credit markets by now we have all become acquainted with the latest in constituent jargon as they barrage us with letters and besiege us at district meetings interest rates bring down the interest rates well my friends controlling money supply is only one part of that battle and there has been looser control than we have been led to believe whereas mib the measure most commonly used has been steadily declining to the point where it is about half of the rate of increase at the beginning of the year m2 a far more reliable barometersince it includes moneymarket fundshas been galloping along at a 10percent clip the other and i believe more important factor is to further reduce the size of the federal budget dcficit a view shared by murray rothbardno fan of reaganomicsin a september economic newsletter furthermore the president has acknowledged the harsh reality that more must be cut and members of this house and our brethren in the senate are quickly coming to the same conclusion clearly then we must find additional targets for trimming and the question becomes not why but where the members will recall that over the last few days i have taken this opportunity at the close of business to bring to the members attention a brief summary of those items contained in the work product of the budget reduction subcommittee of the house republican research committees economic task force in july of this year the committee published a report enumerating 272 items where we believe in good conscience we can make reductions in federal spending for fiscal year 1982 of some 52 billion i shall begin reading today from this list under the category of agriculture the members will recall that agriculture is one of the 20odd functional categories of spending in the federal budget for 1982 and this particular section of the study contains 27 items suggesting cuts totaling some 2 387 856 600 again i would request the members when they hear these suggestions for cuts to ask themselves a question will this cut if implemented by the congress adversely impact on the poor the downtrodden the deprived or the handicapped of our society i would submit that is a very humanitarian question and i would also observe to the members that in my judgment the answer in each instance is no the accomplishment of these cuts would not do that beginning then with those items categcrized under agriculture office of international cooperation and development salaries and expenses we propose to allow 20 percent over that was spent in 1980 the proposed outlay represents a 62 1percent increase since 1980 which we believe is excessive 0l 1740 this cut would save 1 070 400 agriculture stabilization and conservation service dairy and beekeeper indemnities we eliminate this program and phase it out because in our judgment it is no longer needed this wvould save 200 000 federal crop insurance corporation administrative and operating expenses we would allow expenditures for this item to increase by 20 percent over 1980 the proposed outlays are 1 025 8 percent higher than 1980 while the insurance fund declines from 1981 administrative costs are three times higher than the fund which we believe is excessive this item would save the taxpayers 121 394 200 commodity credit corporation price supports we would cut 10 percent from the proposed spending of 1982 we would eliminate the tobacco subsidies it seems a little ironic that the surgeon general of the united states has caused to be printed on cigarettes sold in this country the warning that smoking is hazardous to your health and at the same time we have the taxpayers subsidies tobacco production elimination of this subsidy would save the taxpayers 180 024 900 farmers home administration salaries and expenses we would allow 10 percent above what was spent in 1981 for a savings of 7 968 900 farmers home administration rural housing for domestic farm labor we would allow expenditures for 1982 to increase 10 percent above 1981 for a savings of 5 128 700 farmers home administration mutual and selfhelp housing we would allow growth in 1982 to rise by 10 percent above 1981 spending this would save 552 500 farmers home administration rural housing supervisory assistance grants we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the proposed outlays for 1982 represent a 141 5 percent increase since 1980 which in our judgment is excessive this would save 1 006 400 farmers home administration agricultural credit insurance fund we would allow 10 percent above 1980 we would restrict the funding to corporate agribusiness and reemphasize emergency loans to small farners this would save 87 291 400 farmers home administration rural development insurance fund we would allow expenditures to grow 20 percent above 1980 the proposed outlays represent a 62 8percent increase for this activity since 1980 which we consider to be excessive this would save 92 540 400 office of transportation we would eliminate this function of the department of agriculture because we think that the farmers can figure out how to get their goods to market without it this would save 2 923 000 food and nutrition service food stamp program i will say to the members that this perhaps is the most controversial of the items that i shall mention briefly this afternoon the members should be aware that we are spending roughly some 12 billion on this program in 1982 it is the suggestion of our subcommittee that we reinstate the purchase requirements for this program which if they had been in existence in 1980 would have saved at least 800 000 000 the savings for the reimposition of the purchase requirement would be 1 billion 48 million in 1982 1 would like to bring to the members attention just a brief history of the food stamp program in our country it was enacted in 1964 as a part subsidypart welfare program to allow lowincome families to increase their food purchaing power with stamps purchased at less than redemptive value the program las been amcnded several times to expand eligibility reduce the purchase cost to recipients and increase the bonus value of the stamps in 1977 the requirement that recipients pay for a portion of the value of hi 6267 the stamps was dropped altogether thereby reducing recipient participation costs to zero the easy negotiability of the stamps and restriction of their use to food products has fostered an extensive black market in the last 10 years annual food stamp outlays have increased from 1 6 billion to 9 7 billion an average annual growth rate of 19 8 percent 2 3 times the average annual costofliving increase and twice the average annual gnp increase the food stamp program has been out of control since its inception its benefits are totally duplicative of the food benefit allowances in afdc and ssi which assist threefourths of food stamp recipients in 1977 congress eliminated the purchase requirement which made all but the very poorest recipients pay a portion of the value of the food stamps the arguments to restore the purchase requirement are both philosophic and economic former congresswoman leonor sullivan one of the early proponents of the food stamp program stated the philosophical argument in her congressional retirement speech no oneno oneshould receive food stamps free no matter how small their income they should be required to pay something for the food stamps whatever they can afford to spend for food out of their limited income even if it is only 50 cents or 1 00 for a months food otherwise the stamps are considered a kind of funny money which are merely handed over as a gift from some mysterious source and do not have to be regarded as something you work for and buy anything handed over free in that fashion whether it be food stamps or anything else invites cheating and abuse the economic consequence of removing the purchase requirement has been rapidly increasing case loads and escalating costs the lure of free income was largely responsible for a 42percent caseload increase in one 18month period restoring the purchase requirement as it existed prior to 1977 would turn case load growth rates around and prevent the costs of the food stamp program from reaching a projected 10 3 billion in fiscal year 1981 and so it goes there have been recent accounts in the press of investigations that have been made by various agencies citing fraud and abuse in the food stamp program and it is the suggestion of our committee as indicated earlier that we reinstate the purchase requirement as it existed in 1977 which would reduce expenditures in 1982 by 1 048 billion food and nutrition services food stamp program we would institute a personal consumption index instead of the cpi to determine benefit increases we would employ the same general accounting office and congressional budget office formula as is used for social security this would save 233 489 000 in fiscal year 1982 forest service construction and land acquisitions we would allow a 20percent increase above 1980 the proposed outlays represent an 80 7percent increase since 1980 which is excessive when the federal government is supposed to be backing away from further acquisitions this would save 161 843 800 in 1982 forest service acquisitions of land for national forests special acts we would eliminate this because we do not believe that there is any further reason for the federal government to be acquiring yet more land in this country 754 000 would be saved by adopting this item forest service

inventory this would save 327 000 forest service permanent appropriation 302 account we would allow 10 percent growth above 1981 levels the proposed staff increase for this program of 40 percent from 1981 is excessive and should be rescinded this would save 77 687 100 forest service permanent appropriations 852 account we would allow 10 percent above 1981 this would save 29 073 500 departmentwide in the department of agriculture by correcting their accounting procedures as a result and in response to the recommendations of the general accounting office would save 211 million in fiscal year office of governmental and public affairs in the department of agriculture newly established in 1981 could be eliminated as unnecessary this would save the taxpayers 10 799 000 office of the general counsel we would restrict spending for 1982 to an amount not in excess of 10 percent above what was spent in 1981 saving 255 900 science and education administration agricultural research we would allow 20 percent above what was spent in 1980 the proposed outlays represent a 26 5percent increase over 1980 which we consider to be excessive this would save 23 409 000 science and education administration cooperative research here again we would allow 20 percent above what was spent in 1980 the proposed outlays represent a 34 6percent increase since 1980 which we consider to be excessive this would save 25 507 000 science and education administration extension activities we would cut 10 percent from 1980 the pro a gram has outlived its usefulness it no longer serves farmers as much as it does urban gardepers and we believe it needs to be reevaluated and restructured this would save 56 294 300 agriculture cooperative service we would eliminate this office which was newly established in 1981 this office provides research which can be handied by the economy and statistics service a savings of 4 821 000 foreign agricultural service we would allow spending for 1982 in an amount not in excess of 10 percent over what was spent in 1981 we do not believe it is necessary to spend more on offices in warsaw peking and moscow if those functions are to be performed they can well be performed in the offices of the department of state in those specific foreign capitals this would save 3 595 000 members this completes the itemization and enumeration of those portions of the 272 items that are contained in the agriculture category and to repeat these total some 2 387 856 600 members may well ask well why do we not adopt these suggestions some members may say well i cannot vote for the elimination of some of those programs because i do not agree philosophically with the thrust behind some of the suggestions but please bear in mind members the projected deficit for this next fiscal year scheduled to begin in about 3 weeks has been estimated to range anywhere from 42 billion to 80 billion if they do not~ like these suggestions i might request of the members in a very sincere way what are yours does anybc ly serving in this chamber seriously believe that we can continue to go on as we have over the past 5 years during which this congress has created in excess of 30 percent of the outstanding federal debt of close to 1 trillion the interest expense in servicing that debt is approaching 100 billion for fiscal year 1982 and may be substantially higher than that if we are going to restore vitality to the housing industry and to the automobile industry in this country and the ability of numerous small businesses and indeed large businesses around this nation to survive we must drive down the cost of credit the answer is to get the snout of the federal government out of the credit markets so that our beloved federal government is not competing with every wouldbe borrower for the available credit supply it is estimated that the federal government is consuming about 38 percent of the available credit supply in this fiscal year and that it is close to a historic high in the history of the last several decades we cannot go on this way tomorrow and as the days continue it is the intention of this member from california to enumerate the remaining items of this list totaling some 272 with the idea of developing a consensus in these closing months of the 97th congress of finding a way to restore fiscal sanity to the unitedstates government"],
