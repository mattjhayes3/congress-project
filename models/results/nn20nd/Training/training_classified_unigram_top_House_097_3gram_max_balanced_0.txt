requisite number of words i would first like to begin by concurring in the remarks of the subcommittee chairman that of course the subcommittee will deal as it traditionally has done with the problems that the pay increase and its absorption create for the agencies within our area of responsibility the second point i would like to make since i think the subcommittee chairman has covered the issue very clearly is that when you get down to the appropriations committee level you cannot consider the budget process just in terms of what is in the first budget resolution i think everyone has to understand that and what consequences flow from it because the first budget resolution does indeed set targets for various kinds of activities but it is also true that under the budget and impoundment control act of 1974 that first budget resolution in essence provides a lumpsum to the appropriations committee the appropriations committee under section 302 b of that act then votes a division to that lump sum among the varlous subcommittees each subcommittee then has to live within its section 302 b allocation that may lead to some consequences that are different from those contemplated by the targets in the first budget resolution but they are nonetheless results that are called for under the 1974 budget and impoundment control act as i said during the general debate we find ourselves in this committee in the situation where if amend ments which increase the amounts above those recommended by the appropriations committee pass on the floor today we are going to be faced with resulting reductions in housing we have not included a major housing element in this bill for lack of action on the part of the authorizing committee however when we come to deal with that either when the authorizing committee has passed the housing bill or for lack of it we seek some other procedure to deal with the problem as we will if that committee does not act then because of that section 302 b limitation and the commitment which was made by the chairman of the subcommittee to the ranking minority member of the full committee during general debate we are going to be faced with the fact that any dollar added today that survives the conference is going to be subtracted from the money made available for housing assistance what we have done in putting together this bill was within the limits of the section 302 b allocation given us by the full appropriations commit tee and that was a matter that was debated with some heat within the full appropriations committee we have tried as best we could within those limitations to deal with all of the elements that this subcommittee deals with when you are talking of housing for example we are talking about 9 6 billion of budget authority for housing which the subcommittee has left itself to have available that is an appropriation that used to run 30 billion a year and we are going to have less than onethird of that available for housing assistance so we have had to face some very difficult choices i do not like what has happended with respect to epa i am not happy with that but we on the subcommittee have to make those choices and if this house is going to live up to the budget process it has to make those choices are we to take a housing program that has been cut by twothirds and cut it still further that is the issue we truly face this afternoon i only ask that members who like myself are very sympathetic to more funding for epaas i said if i did not face those constraints i would be offering this amendment because i would have priority on the floor to do itunderstand that issue"], [1.7464160919189453e-05, 0.5000174641609192, 0, "i would agree with the gentleman that is correct all my dear colleague says

construed but that is precisely what my colleague agreed upon we had seven pages of debate a year ago most of us know the issue it was the thinking of the person offering the amendment in acceding to the request of the chairman to speed this bill along that i had no objection i cannot speak for any other members but the gentleman states the case absolutely correctly i offered a similar amendment last august during consideration of the treasurypostal service appropriation bill and it was adopted by a vote of 228 to 170 the amendment was offered again on may 13 of this year during consideration of the supplemental appropriation bill for fiscal year 1981 it was again adopted by the housethis time by a vote of 242 to 155 i am told that the may 13 vote on the ashbrook amendment represented the largest margin of victory ever given an antiabortion amendment in the house of representatives in 1980 the treasury bill failed to be enacted into law by the congress and this provision was not included in the continuing resolution last may the amendment failed to survive the conference committee deliberations i am confident that the house will again adopt my amrendment and i am hopeful that the other body will do likewise i want to reiterate that this amendment does not prohibit a federal employee from having an abortion it does prohibit taxpayer participation in the abortion and this is consistent with past action by the congress i am also told that the ashbrook amendment is in accord with the reagan administrations position on abortion the congress has placed itself in a very unusual position both the house and the senate have agreed to ban medicaidfinanced abortions yet we have been unable to ban taxpayerfunded abortions for federal employees the congress has voted to ban federallyfunded abortions for poor women yet we have been unsuccessful in our attempts to eliminate abortion funding for women who most probably would not be classified as poorfederal employees and their families members of congress and their families it is a strange paradox yesterday i received a dear colleague letter regarding the ashbrook amendment signed by my good friend the gentleman from michigan bill ford the chairman of the post office and civil service committee and cosigned by nine of his democratic colleagues on the committee the letter urged the defeat of the ashbrook amendment let me respond to some of the points raised by my colleagues in the letter point no 1 adoption of the ashbrook amendment would make the federal employee health benefit plan less attractive let mne just respond to that by again saying that my amendment seeks pr2y m~ lmit abortion coverage it does not reduce employee coverage in other areas point no 2 and 1 quote from the letter the head of every major employee organization has expressed displiasure that congress may interfere with ths organizational tool i can only add that government employee unions must be in pretty bad shape if the absence of july 30 1981 abortion coverage in an employee health plan would devastate the union point no 3 and again i quote the ashbrook amendment contains no life of the mother exemption it is a drastic inflexible prohibition which is not supportable on any ethical grounds i think that point needs some clarification my colle~agues are familiar with the rules of the house and know full well that any life of the mother exception added to this amendment would constitute legislation on an appropriation bill and would be subject to a point of order my colleagues will recall that the original hyde amendment did not include a life of the mother provision for that very reason the exception can be included in the other body and in the conference committee point no 4 the ashbrook amendment would make federal employees and postal workers the only employees who are precluded by law from having abortion coverage included in their health benefit plans no similar provision applies in the private sector that is correct but employees in the private sector do not have their health plans subsidized by the taxpayers i also want to address the cost to the taxpayers as a result of current public law we are not talking about a small amount it is estimated that approximately 25 0000 abortions were performed under the federal employees health plans in 1980 reimbursed under fehb at an average cost of 625 at that rate the total reimbursement would be in the neighborhood of 18 000 000 the cost to the taxpayersmost of whom would not want their dollars to subsidize abortionsis indeed significant i
