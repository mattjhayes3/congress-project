me when this bill left the house of representatives it contained an amendment which banned the use of unitedstates passports for the purpose of helping nicaraguan military operations or military operations of communist guerrilla groups in central america as this bill comes back from conference it contains no such language i am told that it was a rather strange process that developed to assure that that language would not be included in this bill so i am going to relate the story as i heard it and if anybody has any reason to doubt anything i say i would appreciate being corrected on the situation i am told that that particular amendment was eliminated first of all on a straight party line vote in conference that the democrats all voted in favor of american passports being used to help nicaraguan military operations and communist military groups and that the republicans all voted against that proposition i think it is important to understand that on this issue the two parties were divided but the democrats also in their straight party line vote decided not to support the position of this house by which this house had gone on record in taking that position and the democrats specifically decided the position of this house should not be defended and should not prevail in the conference now i have also been informed that there was a reason why the democrats took that straight party line position beyond the fact that there seems to be a constant desire around this body to help the sandinistas down there we seem to be able to put all kinds of limitations on freedom fighters in central america or on el salvador or on some of our friends but when it comes to the communist guerrilla groups or the sandinistas we seem to be able then to slide by and help them but i am also told that the majority staff was actually told that if my language my amendment on this was included in the conference report being brought to this floor that that bill would never reach this floor that the democratic leadership on that side was bound and determined that we were not going to have any kind of language brought to this floor that included my amendment now i will tell you that i find that to be rather disturbing it seems to be that the house position was clear it deserved to be defended if certain leaders in this house do not like what the house decides by majority vote i do not think they have the right to pressure that committee in ways to keep legislation off this floor simply to get certain language out that is not the democratic process it once again goes back to the kind of tyranny that seems to prevail in this place with regard to issues i think of real importance i find it disturbing i do not think it is the right way to proceed i feel very strongly that it shows how far we will go in this congress to protect the communist military in nicaragua but it also says a lot about this house that despite the positions taken by the majority the majority will get thwarted when it comes to defending the very extreme left wing positions of the democratic leadership"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9795030821114779, 0.020496917888522148, 1, "further reserving the right

leave because it looks like we are all going to die step across that line that one frenchmanand i am going to find out from the library of congress if he was an american citizen by thenstepped forward

h r 1580 in 1986 i joined a bipartisan majority in this house to pass the antiapartheid act of 1986 it was crucial then and it is crucial now that the most powerful democracy in the world support the democratic aspirations of the south african people and condemn in unequivocal terms the barbarism of apartheid as a result of the painstaking and effective work of my esteemed colleague from pennsylvania mr gray we had an appropriate vehicle for that condemnation the antiapartheid act was the beginning of our efforts to help the south african people join the community of democratic nations to make sure we continue that effort i have applied three criteria to the legislation before us today first the legislation we pass today should continue our moral stance against apartheid by keeping in place existing sanctions all three proposals before us do just that second the legislation should increase the pressure on the public and private sector power structure in south africa to end apartheid but do we increase this pressure simply by adding more sanctions i dont think so a plane wont fly just because you add more wings i believe we can increase the pressure to end apartheid by increasing the effectiveness of sanctions and one of the ways we increase their effectiveness is to internationalize the economic sanctions right now south africas biggest trading partners and investors are the large industrialized democracies including west germany japan england and france as the united states has pulled out of south africa these and other nations have simply increased their activitiesrendering our economic sanctions morally correct but economically meaningless but it is time to progress beyond moral statements by including strong mechanisms to internationalize these sanctions the broomfield amendment passes the effectiveness tcst with its lesser emphasis on cooperative action the dellums bill receives a lesser grade and with the absence of any effort to make sanctions more effective the burton amendment fails this test the third criteria ive applied is potentially the most important the legislation we pass today shouldmustcontribute to the empowerment of black south africans seeking democratic change the mantle of power will pase in south africaof that there can be no doubt it is morally right and strategitally vital that the mantle of power be inherited by those south africans who share our political and economic values there are groups in south africa todaytrade unions business people educators journalists community leaderswhose political and economic aspirations are vital to achieving a free and fair south africa the legislation we pass today should establish a linkage with these groups and should contribute to their empowerment while all three proposals before us today would contribute to this linkage and empowerment the burton amendment makes the most comprehensive and therefore best effort the broomfield alternative does almost as well but the dellums measure is much weaker applying the three criteria moral condemnation increased effectiveness and black empowerment i find that parts of the legislation before us today are greater than whole in a perfect world we would combine the strong moral statement of the dellums bill and the increased effectiveness of mr broomfields proposal with the more comprehensive empowerment measures put forth by mr burton but this is not a perfect world so i will vote for the broomfield amendment to perfect the dellums proposal the broomfield amendment is the
