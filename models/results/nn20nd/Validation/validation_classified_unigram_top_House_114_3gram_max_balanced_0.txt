steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of african americans and they will benefit from the full equality and live the american dream there is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this nation injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights

fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i

budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns

research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican

of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas

provisions which are intended to diminish the ability of the department of interior and the environmental protection agency to protect public health and the environment as ranking member of the

action on climate change is failing and communities across the nation are showing strong support for epas efforts to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions implement tighter ozone standards and protect public health unfortunately there are those in this house who apparently have turned a deaf ear to the american people and instead provide a forum for those who seek to undermine epas work

that we would prohibit epa from taking any action on issues related to methane emissions in addition some of my republican colleagues have grown fond of insisting that epa should only rely on publically available scientific information to support their rules and actions while the goal of a transparent government is laudable the consequence of their insistence is not a more transparent epa but an epa that would be limited as to what science they may consider as my colleagues and i have said before we cannot support a bill and accompanying report that limits or prohibits epa from using the best and most relevant science moreover in response to perceived delays in providing documents requested by congress the authors of this legislation would seemingly punish the hardworking men and women of epas congressional affairs office by reducing their budget request by 4 million dollars if my colleagues really want to address epas inability to provide timely responses to an ever increasing amount of congressional document requests they would not cut the budget of the office tasked with providing those responses it may feel good to those proposing the cut but it is a selfdefeating approach to addressing the ostensible problem finally i would note that a number of amendments have been made in order that if adopted will only make a bad bill worse i intended to

congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i stand on the floor of the house of representatives today and with great sadness acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in orlando florida the worst mass shooting in the history of the united states of america it is a complicated shooting we understand that it most likely is an act of terror a hate crime of unspeakable proportions there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse the shooter appeared to have been in some measure on the fbis radar but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destructionwhich should be reserved for war not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republicand inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others martin luther king jr once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends during the 114th congress there have been more than 100 mass shootings we often come to the floor of the house of representatives and the speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us as members of the house to stand in a moment of silence and then we go on with business as usual having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in america the rest of the world is looking around and saying what are they doing in the united states of america five percent of the worlds population 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land the fbi and local law enforcement cant tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice this is an issue of course that has great impact on the african american community homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger african american men so we in the cbc view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community i think it is one that all americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country but the thing that is also troublingand we will have time to deal with this tragedyis hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list cant purchase weapons of mass destruction how complicated is that to do but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that when you look at some of the leading causes of deathheart disease being number one and then of course diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic certain forms of cancer hiv aids infectionmany of these illnesses these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn in bedfordstuyvesant in east new york in ocean hillbrownsville in canarsie and in the west end of coney island are preventable preventable by better exercise preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many lowincome communities of color have been subjected to resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness preventable by better diet senator booker recently said to many of usand this has stuck with methat more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drivethroughs not drivebys that is because the diet the access to healthy food is limited the food deserts within which many african americans particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level are forced to reside in are scandalous so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful comprehensive fashion i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island coney island cathedral one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists a lack of access to healthy food in the black community it is a campaign that we want to take across the nation we are thankful

write the rules for the worlds economy this measure would allow the president to pass sweeping trade partnerships without the input of the american people through their elected representatives in the normal process despite the various myths circulating about tpa i sincerely believe that it is not in the best interest of our nation as written at this time you have heard it said that a vote against tpa is a vote against international trade but actually a vote against tpa is a vote for a better construct and trade agreement i am a strong supporter of trade when deals are negotiated strategically in the best interest of the united states economically militarily and diplomatically with the president leaving office in just months i have serious concerns about the rapid pace and content of any deal that could have decades of implication many have said tpa will strengthen our international relationships and that may be but while tpa would fasttrack the transpacific partnership in specific currently being negotiated by the president with 11 other pacific nations i am not convinced that this is a partnership that must be done in haste before the president leaves office we currently trade with 6 of the 11 other members our vital yet delicate relationship with chinaa country not included in the transpacific partnershipwould likely be damaged by a rivalry for economic influence in the region the transpacific partnership rewards nations with serious human rights violations while slighting our faithful trade partners with shared values in europe while i support the lifting of trade barriers and promoting better standards of living i believe we must do the right track not the fast track others have claimed tpa will strengthen national security on this point we should take careful note the president has used dangerous and isolating language regarding china with words coming from the white house like hegemony and containment to ask for the tpa or the trade promotional authority but we must note that china is not our enemy therefore we should not put it on the path to become one by isolating china we could easily transform our capabilitiesbased defense strategy to a threatbased one with all of the implication and decades of effort that that would entail it would affect all of our future defense spending and could even begin cold war ii the trade promotional authority can be granted and trade agreements inked without making china excluded or worse our enemy we need to use the next 20 months to repair the relationships as we move towards better trade agreements the trade promotional authority some say gives congress a seat at the negotiating table but the tpa allows congress to set broad objectives for negotiationand that comes at a high price under the trade promotional authority congress sacrifices its authority to make any changes on the final deal and they are left with a simple yes or no vote i believe the american people deserve their voice in trade agreements which impact all of our livelihoods and affect all of our families finances and while trade is vital to economic opportunity and our international friendships i cannot support granting the president permission in light of these concerns with trade promotional authority america has long been fascinated with china from the time of columbus who sought to find a western approach to china and instead discovered america we have been drawn to its ancient culture and its people the earliest american vessel pulled into a canton port in 1748 forty years later we began free

our words somewhat simple what is amusing is that the diplomat was chinese and his comments were directed toward the united states china moved ahead slowly and cautiously with its relations with the west the interplay of western covetousness with chinese reluctance kept the door to china at a mere crack european attempts to force the crack with opium and acquisition of port cities broadened the natural distrust unlike demands of europe though the united states wanted trade not territory unitedstates ambassador burlingame was able to secure the first treaty that china ever made with any western nation in 1861 and china was regarded as an equal chinese workers began to flock to the united states and literally began to move mountains in california as economic opportunity thrived unfortunately the goodwill of lincoln faded in just one generation the plundering of chinese port cities by european competitors changed how americans began to view china the flood of chinese immigrants to california became an easy target for any setback on its economic ascent equals were now called coolies racism reached such a height that in 1882 the united states congressthis bodypassed and the president signed the first ever act that excluded a specific race on immigration we did not even make any pretense about it calling it the chinese exclusion act the provisions remained in effect for nearly 60 years as these events played out commodore perry of the united states navy entered tokyo in 1850 and demanded that japan open up the japanese obliged japan embarked on a stunning modernization program where china was reluctant in an incredible span of only 50 years japan adopted western technology governance law industry and military doctrines her rise from mystic feudalism to world power alarmed the west in response the goodwill of lincoln towards china would take hold again in the form of his youthful personal secretary john hay now an older wiser and towering figure of respect serving as the secretary of state in 1900 hay saw the best way to compete with japan would be to open up china to trade while protecting her territory hays opendoor policy was widely heralded across the globe as the solution to imperial japanese ascendancy this would have longlasting implication but one important side effect was to restore unitedstates chinese relations hay even secured a guarantee from japan in 1908 to respect chinas open door independence and territory it would last only 7 years as china moved to become more enlightened to the west with sun yatsens revolution in selfgovernance in china imperial japan made what was known as the 21 demands during world war i great britain and unitedstates secretary of state william jennings bryan moved quickly to prevent japan from attempting to make china its own protectorate americanchinese relations warmed even further when the united states declared chinas right to autonomy with tariffs and trade in 1928 as oncewarm japanese relations with the united states turned sour over imperial japanese policy in china regarding manchuria america established what became the stimson doctrine which refused to recognize japanese acquisitions in china and upheld chinas rights to its own sovereignty the 1930s saw a mercurial imperial japan plunder china pull out of the league of nations and commit horrific atrocities in nanking and hong kong the unitedstates responded by calling for a global quarantine against japan in defense of china in 1937 chinas own struggles internally with mao zedongs communists paled in comparison to losing its industrial heart and its coast to the imperial japanese army by 1941 america was sending lendlease war material and economic aid to china in her defense american volunteer pilots cut dashing figures as they flew american p40 warhawks for the chinese air force as the famed flying tigers ultimately americas defense of china led it to be attacked at pearl harbor and resulted in a brutal pacific and chinese theater of war during world war ii the united states committed an entire effort in china with vinegar joe stilwell as the commanding general the building of the burma road and by training equipping and launching a chinese army to attack japanese forces immigration restrictions that were imposed in 1882 were now finally repealed america had sympathy for chinas struggle by wars end china was an important partner and ally her struggle did not end however ripped again internally by civil war once the japanese were defeated china would be led by mao zedong and the communist party the united states did not recognize communist china but neither did it materially aid fleeing nationalist chinese on the continent a period of isolation and strained relations with the united states began once again under mao in 1949 china began to arm communists in french indochina the unitedstates became embroiled in a deadly struggle with north korea and countered her assault in the south with an attack that pushed them all the way north to the yalu river on the chinese border alarmed china struck back for the first time since 1900 americans and chinese were fighting each other by 1953 an uneasy line had settled on the korean peninsula chinese relations remained cool with the west but were not always promising with the soviet russia when the unitedstates fought in vietnam china continued to arm and send troops to the communist government of ho chi minh then a series of odd events from 1969 to 1971 brought americans and chinese back to warmer relations in the most unlikely way when soviet russia attacked outposts on the northern border of china mao zedong reassessed relationships with the united states he reasoned that china could not be isolated by both world powers overtures from president nixon in his inaugural address and a series of pingpong matches created dialogue for the first time in decades in 1971 henry kissinger went on a secret mission to china opening the way for nixons visit with mao who would have thought that the man that shunned the united states in favor of communism and the president that built his reputation on fighting communism would both come to realize that our nations despite their differences needed each other mainland china was now officially recognized by the united nations the unitedstates set up diplomatic offices trade agreements opened relations warmed by the 1980s with state visits from both countries as the horizon brightened and the chinese people hoped the chinese government cracked down on dissidents in tiananmen square the unitedstates alarmed imposed sanctions and restrictions tensions loomed through the 1990s culminating with the unitedstates bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade serbia in 1999 during the kosovo campaign calmer heads prevailed and tensions eased by 2001 trade restrictions were loosened once again china pledged a deep commitment to fight the war on terror and committed material aid in great amounts for the effort by 2006 chinaunitedstates relations deepened under the strategic economic dialogue business in both countries increased as commerce offered great economic opportunity for both countries on the verge of a bright future we now see today with timidity and fear where we should see opportunity and favor with regard to china china needs us and we need china yet we see in the last week a week of a barrage of negative press on china covering everything from hedging them on trade to condemning them and their development of island outposts in the china sea to framing them up as the new military threat that must be checked by the united states dialogue and diplomacy are cheaper than tanks and tomahawks does the united states really wish to believe that we can leave a capabilitiesbased military to create some new threatbased military and it would be in our favor while china is not our enemy we could certainly set the conditions to make them one in the future it would be a tragic mistake it would devour our diplomacy drain our defense and diminish our domestic priorities worse it could set the course for some future horrific conflict between dozens of friendly nations that we currently trade with including chinaincluding china where is the dialogue on including china in the transpacific partnership i have not heard it from this chamber or the white house sure we claim they can join if they meet the standard only after we use every antichinese statement in trying to make the case for the trade promotion authority that is not very reassuring some say we must not include china at all in the transpacific partnership because of their human rights record others object because they are a communist nation others cite the fact that china has been our former enemy well here are some thoughts to ponder if we can forgive germany and japan for horrific human rights violations in world war ii can we not reach out to china if we can embrace former enemies who reformed their existing communist governments such as vietnam can we not reach out to china if we can turn former enemies such as great britain canada mexico spain the philippines germany austria hungary italy japan and vietnam into our top trading partners can we not also reach out to china china needs petroleum and natural gas and we have plenty of it we have both ready to export china wants to lay thousands of miles of road in ambitious projects for her commerce we have the raw materials for asphalt industry to make their roadpaving machines and colleges to educate their engineers we need china 3 8 million chinese nationals live and work in the united states that is more than the population of my home state of oklahoma china constitutes our greatest trading partner working with thousands of businesses that bolster our economy and better our quality of life our peoples are historically and deeply intertwined we must proceed with wisdom and caution while we love trade and while we love economy we can work out differences rather than magnify them and deepen suspicion and concern instead we can dialogue the same standards that people often cite with regard to china and how she is stealing technologies or making shoddy goods were the same charges that we leveled against japan in the 1960s and south korea in the 1980s yet we no longer have those concerns about those allies today with their incredible effort economy and technology our peoples are historically and deeply entwined the united states and china and we must work hard to maintain that i would hope that our colleagues and our president would temper the rhetoric with regard to discussions on trade and using it as some new effort to hedge or contain china rather than to embrace and trade with that nation whatever differences we may have can be worked out in the spirit and good will of lincoln i yield back the balance of my time"],

working group act of 2013 which addresses an emerging and important topic in emergency management more and more we are seeing social media especially twitter facebook and youtube playing a critical role in the preparedness response and recovery operations in emergency situations in the past few years social media has become a valuable tool that has been used by emergency managers at all levels to warn those in harms way of impending natural disasters i might add that the same could occur in terrorist disasters moreover it has been used to inform survivors of how to access disaster assistance and tips for speedier recovery equally important social media has been used to coordinate and manage assistance from nonprofits and volunteers who want to help in recovery efforts it is not just emergency managers who use social media regarding emergencies individuals have used social media to help identify locations where assistance may still be needed and to raise awareness of impending hazards they have used it to communicate with loved ones who may be impacted by an event as well as to reconnect pets with their owners it was no different here in the district of columbia after 9111 and i refer to the earthquake centered in mineral virginia but certainly felt in every part of the nations capital because cellphone service was jammed residents turned to social media to communicate within minutes of that earthquake twitter noted that over 40 000 earthquakerelated tweets were sent about the occurrence facebook noted 3 million mentions related to the earthquake in 2010 the department of homeland security established the virtual social media working group to provide recommendations on how to use social media before during and after emergencies the existing working group consists of emergency responders nonprofit organizations and federal agencies h r 623 would codify the working group to make certain that their good work continues to allow for broader representation the bill expands the working group membership to include the private sectors and requires consultation with nonmembers to ensure accountability the bill requires an annual report to congress on important issues such as best practices and lessons learned it would also provide recommendations on various issues including how to improve the use of social media for emergency

the type of activity that would leave 30 of our nations most promising future military leaders injured or call into question the management practices of the armys top academy yet that is exactly what happened we just learned that on august 20 west point freshman cadets got together for an annual pillow fight and according to press accounts they swung pillowcases packed with large hard objects thought to be helmets this fight badly injured 30 cadets 24 of them diagnosed with concussions there were shoulders dislocated one cadet diagnosed with a hairline fracture of the cheekbone some with broken noses and split lips before the fight upperclassmen commanders reportedly encouraged the freshmen by telling them if you dont come back with a bloody nose you didnt try hard enough the american people deserve to know what happened here west point and the army have provided conflicting explanations saying in one instance many members of the plebe class spontaneously participated in a pillow fight while in another they suggested that a pillow fight is a hallowed annual tradition dating back to 1897 well which is it west point apparently doesnt know how to run this pillow fight either this rite of passage has a track record of similar injuries followed by ineffective attempts to make this event safer two years ago for example the 2013 pillow fight was canceled after at least one cadet placed a lockbox as a weapon in a pillowcase now it is back and according to reports the helmets the cadets were using to give their teammates concussions had been mandated as protection after injuries in previous pillow fights may i remind everyone that this education is being paid for directly by the taxpayers of this country the unitedstates government funds everything the academy does to the tune of millions of dollars a year it is utterly irresponsible to think that a violent pillow fight is a way to build camaraderie and create a professional military west point has stated that all cadets are back on duty and that it is pursuing an investigation but congress needs to know what kind of investigation it is pursuing and when we will receive answers as the ranking member of the house armed services committees subcommittee on oversight and investigations i am calling on the army and the unitedstates military academy to provide a clear explanation of the incident and its causes as well as a full accounting of who was responsible and what measures are being taken to prevent something like this from happening again we will not create the worlds most feared fighting
