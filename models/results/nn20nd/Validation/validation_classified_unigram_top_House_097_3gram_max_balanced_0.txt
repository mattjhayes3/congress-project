and i would like to commend him for his efforts to call attention to issues that pertain to children which i think represents a foundation of this great country during the first year of the reagan administration we have witnessed repeated threats to the health and educational needs of handicapped childrenin short to their basic constitutional rights early in the year for example there were efforts to repeal public law 94142 the education for all handicapped children act this law enacted in 1975 insures all children in this nation a free and appropriate public education suitable to their individual learning needs efforts to repeal public law 94142 did not succeed but instead drew sharp criticism from concerned citizens and legislators who argued that the repeal of this law would undermine a decade of progress for handicapped children and their families very soon another attack on public law 94142 was launched this time to rob the law of its potency by removing key requirements such as the individualized education plan known popularly as the iep the rights of parents to be involved in the development of their childs educational program and the procedural safeguards due process that enable parents to challenge inappropriate programs or placements for their handicapped child these dismantling efforts were also defeated but the program was soon injeopardy again this time it was the administrations budget proposal that funding for education of the handicapped be included in the block grants to local education agencies leas this effort too was defeated but only for the time being future attempts will be made to alter this important program and these must also be turned aside for a number of reasons funding education of the handicapped out of general education block grants made to the states for their overall education needs would surely result in a scramble for funds already reduced by 25 percent to 38 percent or more such a scramble would be most unfair to handicapped children and their families a recent gao study clearly demonstrates that this type of competition for resources under a block grant program to the states would lead to inadequate or inappropriate programs for many specialneeds children this study shows that the state in which a child lives affects the quality of education that a child receives the study also indicates that school districts with fewer resources are likely to exclude handicapped children from receiving special educational services another serious curtailment of services to the handicapped will occur through the removal of federal regulations responsible for tracking the states education money because the states will be required to do no reporting there is no assurance that handicapped children will be served at all in a given state under a block grant system the repeal of this reporting requirement if allowed amounts to a virtual abandonment of federal leadership on behalf of handicapped children in the state of washington for example legislators have taken a cue from the federal block grant fever they have applied the principle at their state level by combining a variety of programs for specialneeds children into a single block grant though it is thought that nearly the same numbers of children are being served it is certain that services are or soon will be seriously cutback under that kind of funding pattern this block grant move at the state level is being challenged by several local school districts serious questions have come up regarding the legality of the plan in that funding for handicapped programs under current law is allocated on a categorical basisthat is handicap by handicap such as deaf blind mentally retarded and so on several suits are pending against the state by the various educational agencles serving these handicapped childrei these organizations recognize that such an allocation of funds will not allow them to serve handicapped children adequately according to existing laws still in effect even if this block grant action in the state of washington does fail and other actions that undermine programs for the handicapped in other states are turned back additional threats to programs for education of the handicapped are on the horizon most recent is a plan from omb for fiscal year 1983 which proposes a block grant made up of moneys for several special programs for handicapped institutionalized gifted and other special students a current estimate is that this proposal will result in as much as a 65 percent reduction in funds for special programs for children in need of specific kinds of educational services those of us who believe in the constitutional rights of every member of our society to a free public education cannot sit by and watch the legislative gains of the last two decades be wiped out education of the handicapped has proven itself to be a wise investment in preserving human worth as well as societies dollars legislation that supports the education of the handicapped must be preserved and adequate funding must be made available if we are not to incur greater expenditures than ever children whom we

simply because someone tells me something is unconstitutional if i had proceeded without interruption i would never have mentioned the word constitutionality my opposition to the amendment is not based alone on the question of constitutionality that is something that we have to take a stand on and let the chips fall where they may my observation is based on statements that we had last year i mentioned the central intelligence agencys general counsel and i would quote the statement from the deputy director of the cia in last years emergency measure finally a statute which requires proof that unauthorized disclosures by those who have not had an employment or other relationship of trust with the united statesand this is the area we are talking about section 601 c were made with specific intent to impair or impede the nations foreign intelligence activitics this requirement would be for the protection of those who might claim they had made a public disclosure for this legitimate purpose although i believe congress did determine if there are any specific purposes and made a provision for them so last year the deputy director was in favor of a specific intent standard i would simply say again to use our chairmans very apt description let us keep our eye on what we are really trying to do here we are trying to pass a bill first and foremost we are trying to pass a bill which solves a problem and the problem has been delineated that is the reprehensible and heinous crime of divulging information on people who were posted under cover we want to do it in an effective efficient and hopefully trim and legal way i think that what we have before the house has done specifically that it has recognized the problem and we have moved to answer the problem with tools which had the broad support and socalled consensus that any bill has to have in order to pass we need not require only constitutional muster but we also must pass this through the congress for

friendly allied nations have sought the privilege of buying f16 aircraft because of its demonstrated air superiority i am here to report today that since july 3 the f16xl has enjoyed six perfect totally successful test flights it has met or exceeded every expectation of its design it has recently been ferried to edwards air force base for air force testing and the aircraft had no discrepancies upon landing just to give you an idea of the new state of the art of the f16 aircraft the xl version is an evolutionary improvement in that it can go 2 3 times as far as the f16s now in service with the same bomb load or it can carry 2 3 times as heavy a bomb load over the same distance or any reasonable combination of the two it doubles some parts of the maneuverability envelope of this extremely maneuverable aircraft which almost could come and turn around inside this chamber it produces a lower radar crosssection in other words it is less easily detectable by enemy radar
