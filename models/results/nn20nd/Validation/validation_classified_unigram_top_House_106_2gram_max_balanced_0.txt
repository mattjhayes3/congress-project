and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass

100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that

couple of other issues and then i will conclude we also have a responsibility to deal with the farm crisis and we have not done so very well we have a farm bill that doesnt work the freedom to farm bill does not work it has been a failure since it was enacted in 1996 the promise was produce what you want we will sell it overseas and get rid of the farm program and things will be better off since that time prices have collapsed and family farmers have had an awful time trying to make ends meet in most cases they are receiving far less now in real terms than they received during the great depression for their product these are not people who are slothful these are not people who arent being productive they are economic allstars they produce in prodigious quantity the food the world needs so desperately yet the market says by the way your food has no value while people climb trees to pick leaves to eat in countries around the world where there is not enough food family farmers driving a 2ton truck to a country elevator are told by the grain trader your food has no value something is wrong with that what really has no value is the current farm program it doesnt work it is long past time to fix it we are within three or four votes of doing that i encourage help from the other side to give us the votes needed to pass a farm program that provides real assistance for family farmers while we are on the subject of freedom those who wrote the freedom to farm billi didnt and i voted against itshould understand there is something called the freedom to sell the freedom to sell means if you want to give family farmers the freedom to produce whatever lets also give them the freedom to sell their products in markets such as iran iraq cuba north korea and others that have been off limits to them because this country has imposed economic sanctions against countries whose behavior we dont like i am fine with economic sanctions slap them with sanctions but dont ever include food as a part of those sanctions using food as a weapon is unbecoming to this country a country as big and as good and as powerful and as important as this country ought never use food as a weapon the freedom to sell is a pretty important principle whichwe ought to care a bit about there is an amendment that i put in the appropriations bill now in conference and i know there are a couple of house leaders who are intending to try to kill that as we get to conference i am hoping with the bipartisan support we received in the senate that we wfll prevail on this issue finally one of the other important issues we face as we wrap up this congress is trying to do something to strengthen the education system in our country we have the opportunity to do that it is just that we have all of this bickering back and forth we have things that we know need to be done everybody here understands that if you are in a classroom of 15 people there is more learning going on than if there is a classroom with 1 teacher and 30 kids class size matters we have proposals to reduce class size which will dramatically improve education we also understand you cannot learn in schools that are in functional disrepair no wonder there is disrepair in the schools they were built 50 or 60 years ago after world war ii when we had soldiers coming back having families and building schools for their children all across the country many of these schools are still in use today and are in desperate need of repair and remodeling if anyone doubts that take a trip to the ojibwa school on the turtle mountain indian reservation or the cannon ball elementary school south of bismarck nd take a look at those schools and ask yourself whether those schools need help the third grader who walks through the classroom door in the cannon ball school ought to be able to expect the same opportunity for a good education as all kids in this country yet these children dont have the same opportunity we know that yet legislation to improve and modernize our schools languish in this senate because some people dont believe it is important or some people believe they cannot do it because if they did somebody would declare victory for a public policy that makes sense lets declare victory for a little common sense in all of these areas education health care agriculture there are so many areas the agenda in this congress is the agenda we establish if we are a congress of underachievers that is our fault not something we blame on anybody else i wish i were in the majority here but i am not the majority

and phase it out over time this is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting them in two they are asking if they can get half a prescription filled because they simply cant afford

discussions at the committee about it and i was part of the subcommittee part of the investigation the gentleman from new york mr qunn and i went out and visited arlington and i voted for the bill the last time i was one of the 412 to 0 that supported it because i thought we had assurances that there was going to be done some work was going to be done on the bill to improve it the deal was some of the concerns that had been brought up but we have now come almost i guess a year and a half or 2 years later a year later certainly and no work has been done and the arguments are the same and we have learned now two different things number one we have learned that the bill died on the senate side they did not take up the bill i think because of concerns that have been expressed by the gentleman from california and some others that there is not wiggle room in this bill to allow for those extraordinary events that occur the other thing that has occirred is this last year is the terrible tragedy that we had with the shooting of two of the capitol police officers and one of them under this bill clearly would not qualify for burial at arlington and i know of very very few people in this nation who do not believe that officer gibson deserved burial at arlington cemetery for giving his life to protect every american who was in the capitol that day and plans on coming to the capitol to protect this shrine of democracy so that is the problem i have with this bill this year we have not learned from the events of the last year and i think this is something that good faith people can work on now the alternative we have been given under the language of this bill is that legislation could be passed but we all know there are going to be situations that will occur when congress is not in session when we are in the august recess when it is a week before a campaign and there has been a terrible tragedy there is not going to be a special session of congress called to deal with it beyond the inconvenience and the problems of dealing with a family in a 3 or 4day period of time when we are not in session is just the whole idea of thinking about dealing with a bill that has been filed with 10 cosponsors to open up arlington to a specific member are my colleagues going to be the people that step forward and say i am going to vote against that family they were not heroic enough i do not think that is the kind of legislation that we are going to want to deal with down the line so i personally think that legislatibn is an unsatisfactory resolution another aspect of the bill i have problems with that we did not talk about much during committee is the fact that monuments in arlington under this bill will be limited to military events only that means that the monument that is there now for challenger for the challenger disaster the space shuttle disaster under the language of this bill we could have no future monuments like that because the nasa mission is not a military event i think that is unfortunate i think the people that were in the space shuttle were clearly heroic folks in conclusion i do not fault the intent of this bill i think as my colleagues know to codify this to make these rules known to people out in america what it means to be buried at arlington i think that is a noble effort the problem i have is we have not done the work on this side and

their budgets every single year i would also point out that you will hear discussion amongst the minority and the majority about whether or not we as republicans with our plan are using social security surpluses or not you realize that this argument has gotten down now to the point where we are having a fight between omb and cbo whether their predictions are right whether we use omb numbers

really think it makes a big difference let me also point out for those who say that a 1 percent cut will result in unacceptable reductions in spending in critical programs let me point out that even

government waste entitled prime cuts 1999 and i would suggest that every cabinet member and everybody in the administration take an opportunity to read this book because there are plenty of suggestions which total well in excess well in excess of 1 percent some of the more interesting proposals that i have seen come across my desk in the last couple of days are and let me give you a couple of examples perhaps we could eliminate a subsidy of 850 000 to a wellknown ice cream company in a state adjacent to mine which they received from the federal government to distribute their product in russia as if it is not cold enough in russia for them to produce their own ice cream or that this particular company cannot find the resources to develop its own advertising campaign or how about delays administrative delays in the disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties that are costing taxpayers in this country a million dollars a day or how about a government audit that recently found that federal agencies were simply unable to account for 800 billion 800 billion in government assets and i can go on and on page after page and i think that the american people find it pretty ludicrous to believe that no federal agency can cut 1 percent from their budget so again i think this is a reasonable proposal and i am proud that this body has taken it upon itself to pass it and send it down to the white house"]]}
