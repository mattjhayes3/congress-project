president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive

said in his remarks i have struggled with the gentleman from california as a member of the subcommittee of the appropriations committee on transportation and i have pledged to him to continue struggling with him on this particular issue i have gone to burbank i have toured the airport i have met with members of the airport authority and i have also met with some constituents of the gentleman from california who are interested in alleviating the noise problem it is a difficult issue because the geographic terrain and the location of the navaids do not apportion flights in a normal manner which would be an equal noise distribution for example although the amendment by the gentleman from california in the bill talks only about departures the gentleman from californias constituents are nonetheless subjected not only to a disproportionate share of the noise on departure but all the navigation aids for landing put noise over their rooftops as well because the approach the localizer and the ndb approaches to the airport are on runway 7 so landing on runway 7 is the norm while taking off on runway 15 is the norm i also agree with the gentleman from california that there is a recalcitrance a political recalcitrance on the ground in the burbankglendalepasadena area which sought to be overcome i also agree with the gentleman from california that this particular amendment in the bill should it survive is not impacting on safety does not direct any air traffic controller in the tower to order a plane to take off in an unsafe manner but nonetheless i would say that i think the language in the bill is a little premature at this particular time the reason for that is that a part 150 noise study is underway right now it will be concluded at the end of november and it is on that study it is upon that study which the airport authority should reflect before it makes any planned submission ironically if this piece of legislation were to pass the airport authority would not be able to get an airport grant to pay for the study upon which they would be relying in making their recommendation furthermore the essential fact here is that this airport needs a grant to build a new terminal and the gentleman from california has been wonderful in helping work out a situation there to get the new terminal placed appropriately on that field and some of the burbank and glendale folks have come to agreement on the location of the terminal we need to get that old terminal torn down because that old terminal is creating an unsafe condition on runway 7 if this piece of legislation were to pass there would be no grant aid to effectuate the new terminal and the destruction of the old unsafe terminal location so what we really have here today at this point in time although i have much sympathy and agreement for the gentleman from californias position and that of his constituents having been there but this is somewhat an effort to get the airport authority to cry uncle i am in favor of making them cry uncle but i am in favor in making them cry uncle if we need to after that part 150 study on noise abatement after the environmental impact

and i honor them forit i want to end by saying while i am going to vote with the gentleman from california today i pledge to my good friend the gentleman from california to continue to seek a solution and i admonish my good friend from southern california who represents the cities of the airport that in the future if the airport expresses some kind of parochial political recalcitrance in this

peryear on defense if the hunter amendment were passed and the japanese did increase their defense spending by 3 percent they would be spending 66 billion the united states today is spending 280 billion if there is an example of why the japanese need to spend more on defense one only has to look to the persian gulf i am sure many of the speakers have pointed that out in the debate there is not a prohibition in the japanese constitution against their spending more than 1 percent there is a policy of the japanese government against their spending more than 1 percent so if we as a nation as our official policy were to go to them and ask them to increase defense spending in a very serious way and a systematic way i think there is every likelihood that they would do so for all of these

of the department of agriculture to build a new plant stress and water conservation laboratory at lubbock tx this laboratory is much needed and will provide invaluable research in the areas of plant stress and water conservation i urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill in the way of background i would like to inform the house that much of the agricultural production in the great plains region of the united states is subject to long periods of environmental stress usually due to drought and high temperatures as a result crop yields have frequently suffered bringing economic disruption to wide areas of the united states in order to overcome these fluctuations the use of irrigation in this region has increased to the point where over onehalf of the food and fiber in this region is produced on irrigated acreage however the main source of ground water for this region is the ogallala aquifer which is being overdrawn at a rapid rate this overdraft combined with higher energy prices points to a decreased ability to depend upon irrigated farming in this region in the future with this change comes the potential for a return to past cycles of drought in the great plains recognizing this shift a cooperative department of agriculture plant stress and water conservation unit was established at texas tech university in lubbock tx in 1979 this unit was established following a 1978 feasibility study conducted by the department of agriculture that recommended the program and construction of a laboratory to house the program at lubbock in 1983 planning for the laboratory progressed to the point that architechtural and engineering plans were made for the facility through fiscal year 1987 congress has appropriated a total of 5 750 000 for the cooperative research in plant stress and water conservation unit and 1 300 000 for laboratory planning the mission of the plant stress and water conservation research unit is to determine avoidance tolerance and survival mechanisms associated with plant growth and development under water and thermal stress relate these mechanisms to the dynamics of nutrient and water transport through the soilplantatmosphere continuum define the limits of genetic variablity of these mechanisms and develop improved crops and cropping systems there are currently about 20 state and agricultural research service scientists involved in these undertakings in the research unit the program at lubbock has a number of advantages stemming from its location at texas tech university located in an area with typical soil types and with other agroclimatic conditions found throughout the region it is an ideal location for the study of regional problems the availability of shared research plots is also an advantage as well as the availability of joint appointments and graduate and postgraduate research training programs unfortunately the research program has grown to a point where the lack of adequate laboratory facilities has become a signficiant limiting factor in the complexity and precision of the research i hope you will join me in supporting this bill which will enable this valuable research to continue and expand i

nobody recognizes what it was like here in central america before people like this man the contras came into existence there were armed forces coming across the border into el salvador arms and shipments and people coming across there to overthrow this government at the present time we now have four very fragile democracies in central america the only reason these democracies can continue to
