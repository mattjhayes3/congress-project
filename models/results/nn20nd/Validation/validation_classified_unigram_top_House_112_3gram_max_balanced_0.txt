ceos continued to receive milliondollar payouts while too many middle class americans are still out looking for work this congress is voting again to give over 160 000 a year in tax breaks to the richest 2 percent of americans while the average american will be lucky to get about one100th or maybe two100ths of that can anyone in this chamber blame the middle class for thinking the system is rigged against them we all admire financial success but when we give away trillions in tax cuts that we cannot afford to those who need them the least its the middle class who has to make up the difference to pay for these tax cuts our republican colleagues have voted to end medicare and would force seniors to pay 6 400 more for their own care on top of that republicans propose changing social security slashing its budget by over 800 million its an ideological agenda that chooses millionaires over the middle class regular folks pay more so that folks like donald trump and mitt romney

company boeing but this bill has wideranging repercussions for american workers this bill does not protect or create jobs it just doesnt it forces american workers to fight over existing jobs by giving up their rights and underbidding each other its a race to the bottom the republican bill makes it easier to ship unitedstates jobs overseas theres no question about that and the republican bill creates an open season for ceos to punish workers for exercising their rights again this is a further assault on the rights and protections that workers have fought so hard for for so many decades and

come together in recognition of our shared values from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american value i urge my colleagues to reject this ruse to reject the reconciliation process and to work toward a comprehensive and responsible and

economy and it fails to offer a balanced approach to deficit reduction the republican budget relies solely on spending cuts it chooses tax reductions for millionaires at the expense of the middle

know it rather than protecting the promise of medicare for seniors now and into the future the republicans break that promise rather than reducing costs through payment and delivery system reforms the republicans do nothing to contain costs and they simply shift the cost burden onto our seniors rather than guaranteed benefits the republicans leave seniors on their own to buy what benefits they can afford with a voucher of limited value this means seniors are subjected to the uncertainty of the insurance industry meaning possible discrimination based on age illness and income their budget even cuts health coverage for our sickest and frailest seniors threatening their access to vital nursing home care for decades medicare has provided both financial and health security for americas seniors

rise today in opposition to the budget control act of 2011 which like the previous debtceiling bills introduced by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle attempts to resolve our budget ceiling crisis by demanding sharp cuts to domestic programs that ask average americans to make lifechanging sacrifices while not asking americas wealthiest individuals and most profitable corporations to contribute their fair share in my lifetime i have never seen such a concerted effort to ransom the american economy in order to extort the american public while i support bipartisan efforts to increase the debt limit and to resolve our differences over budgetary revenue and spending issues i cannot support a bill that unduly robs average americans of their economic security and ability to provide for their families while constraining the ability of congress to deal effectively with americas economic fiscal and job creation troubles the budget control act of 2011 cuts 22 billion dollars from the federal budget for fy2012 robert mcintyre of citizens for tax justice testified before the senate budget committee that tax loopholes for corporations big business owners and business investors cost the treasury department 365 billion dollars in fy2011 we need to change the tone here in congress federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said it best when he stated in a recently before the house committee on financial services we really dont want to just cut cut cut chairman bernanke further stated you need to be a little bit cautious about sharp cuts in the very near term because of the potential impact on the recovery that doesnt at all precludein fact i believe its entirely consistent witha longerterm program that will bring our budget into a sustainable position the boehner plan does just that it will cut cut cut without taking into full consideration the serious cuts to social security medicare and medicaid this bill is essentially a rehashed version of the same bill that president obama promised to veto and the senate vowed to reject it asks for 917 billion in cuts from domestic spending for a 900 billion dollar increase in the debt ceiling while demanding nothing in revenue from the nations wealthiest this is nothing more than a ransom note irresponsibly raising the debt ceiling for only a few months so that in just a short period of time the american public will be hit again for 1 6 trillion in cuts from social security medicare medicaid and veterans benefits anyone who believe that this plan will not result in a serious cut to social security should consider this social security represents 20 percent of all federal spending making it unrealistic to think such large cuts in mandatory spending will not affect social security benefits i state here today that the boehner proposal is illconceived and fails to offer a balanced approach to decreasing the deficit instead of requiring shared sacrifice the boehner plan places the entire burden on the backs of seniors the middle class and our nations most vulnerable citizens while doing nothing to close corporate tax giveaways and increase taxes on those most able to afford them the boehner plan calls for large cuts in discretionary programs of 1 2 trillion over the next 10 years through strict new spending caps most experts predict that the first round of cuts would target discretionary programs including education infrastructure job training and law enforcement the boehner plan would then require an additional 1 8 trillion in savings to be identified by the end of the year as a condition for raising the debt ceiling again at that time given the magnitude of these additional required savings it would result in deep draconian cuts in federal entitlement programs such as social security medicare and medicaid a repeal of health reforms coverage expansions and a dramatic reduction in safety net programs for vulnerable americans such as food stamps and unemployment and disability insurance this is unacceptable and each is avoidable if corporations and the wealthy are required to shoulder a fair share of this burden the speakers plan requires a vote on an illadvised constitutional balanced budget amendment in both chambers of congress by the end of this year the details surrounding exactly which proposed constitutional balanced budget amendment will be voted on are unclear however earlier proposals that have appeared in the house of representatives including h j res 1 would have a devastating impact on discretionary spending and on our modest economic recovery passing an amendment to the constitution is one of the most serious processes the united states congress can undertake requiring a two thirds supermajority of support in both the house and senate and ratification by threefourths 3 4 of the states the founders purposely made the amendment process a long and arduous one do my republican colleagues really expect congress to capriciously pass an amendment altering our nations founding document on such short notice an amendment that will fundamentally change our country without reasonable time for debate without the opportunity for a hearing or questioning of witnesses without any reports as to what impact it may have by tying the fate of whether the united states pays its debt obligations to the historically prolonged constitutional amendment process the republicans who support this bill have demonstrated at this critical juncture in american history that they are profoundly irresponsible when it comes to the integrity of our economy and utterly bereft of sensible solutions for fixing it the speakers plan will result in for 2 7 trillion in deficit reduction and a 2 5 trillion increase in the debt limit in two stages with the two debt ceiling increases being conditioned upon enactment of an initial set of spending cuts and a later second deficit reduction measure i do not believe that congress should yield its authority to what amounts to a commission boehners plan creates a 12member joint congressional committee to develop a plan for an additional 1 8 trillion in deficit reduction that congress would vote on in december in addition the speakers plan authorizes the president to submit a 900 billion increase in the 14 3 trillion debt ceiling immediately after enactment of this bill and a 1 6 trillion increase if the 1 8 trillion deficit reduction measure is enacted both debt limit increases would take effect automatically unless congress enacted resolutions of disapproval the speakers plan also requires the house and senate to vote by the end of the year on a balanced budget amendment to the constitution as i have stated before this will tie the hands of congress finally as noted above the boehner proposal provides only a shortterm extension of the federal debt ceiling this means that the gridlock that now prevails in our government will continue for the remainder of the 112th congress according to the center on budget and policy recent reports have suggested that rating agencies will downgrade the unitedstates credit rating if the boehner proposal is enacted this would result not only in higher interest costs to the federal government but also would raise the interest rate paid by individuals and families on car loans credit cards and mortgages throughout the united states taken together all of these factors would undermine the nations fragile recovery there has been a theme this congress of focusing on cutting programs that benefit the public good and for the most at need while ignoring the need to focus on job creation and economic recovery this bill is wasting a tremendous amount of time when we should be focused on paying our nations bills and resolving our differences in my district the texas 18th more than 190 000 people live below the poverty line we must not we cannot at a time when the census bureau places the number of american living in poverty at the highest rate in over 50 years cut vital social services not in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and persistent unemployment when so many rely on federal benefits to survive like the supplemental nutrition access program snap that fed 3 9 million residents of texas in april 2011 or the women infant and children wic program that provides nutritious food to more than 990 000 mothers and children in my home state in 2009 there were 43 6 million americans living in poverty nationwide according to the 2010 federal poverty threshold determined by the us census a family of four is considered impoverished if they are living on less than 22 314 per year children represent a disproportionate amount of the united states poor population in 2008 there were 15 45 million impoverished children in the nation 20 7 of americas youth the kaiser family foundation estimates that there are currently 5 6 million texans living in poverty 2 2 million of them children and that 17 4 of households in the state struggle with food insecurity there is no doubt that we must reduce the national debt but my republican colleagues desire for instant gratification through deep spending cuts to benefits medicare medicaid and social security is reckless and threatens the financial security of millions of americans instead of closing corporate tax loopholes to reduce the deficit the budget control act cuts discretionary spending and requires congress to draft proposals to cut at least 1 8 trillion from medicare and social security this is an outrage and an insult to the american dream forcing congress to draft plans to cut 1 8 trillion from medicare and social security forces members to disregard the best interests of their constituents medicare guarantees a healthy and secure retirement for americans who have paid into it for their entire working lives protecting medicare represents the basic values of fairness and respect for our seniors including the 2 9 million texans who received medicare in 2010 any cuts to medicaid would be just as damaging harris county has one of the highest medicaid enrollment records in texas limits and cuts to medicaid funds would significantly hurt the citizens of texass 18th district harris county averages between 500 4300 and 600 000 medicaid recipients monthly thousands of people who may not have access to healthcare should congress sacrifice medicaid to cut spending yes we must take steps to balance the budget and reduce the national debt but not at the expense of vital social programs it is unconscionable that in our nation of vast resources my republican colleagues would pass a budget that cuts funding for essential social programs poverty impacts far too many americans and social safety nets provide these individuals with vital assistance perhaps my friends on the other side of the aisle are content to conclude that life simply is not fair equality is not accessible to everyone and the less advantaged among us are condemned to remain as they are but i do not accept that that kind of complacency is not fitting for america as we continue to discuss the necessity of increasing out debt ceiling i have heard the concerns of many of my constituents and the american people regarding the size of our national debt and the care with which taxpayer money is spent i too am concerned about these issues for to burden future generations of americans with tremendous amounts of debt should not be a way to avoid our fiscal responsibilities to the american people however the task of resolving our debt ceiling crisis must take precedence over other concerns including political ideology the game is up and the american people understand that increasing the debt ceiling has nothing to do with any new spending and everything to do with paying off the obligations that we have already agreed to and promised to pay prior to the existence of the debt ceiling congress had to approve borrowing each time the federal government wished to borrow money in order to carry out its functions with the onset of world war i more flexibility was needed to expand the governments capability to borrow money expeditiously in order to meet the rapidly changing requirements of funding a major war in the modern era to address this need the first debt ceiling was established in 1917 allowing the federal government to borrow money to meet its obligations without prior congressional approval so long as in the aggregate the amount borrowed did not eclipse a specified limit since the debt limit was first put in place congress has increased it over 100 times in fact it was raised 10 times within the past decade congress last came together and raised the debt ceiling in february 2010 today the debt ceiling currently stands at 14 3 trillion dollars in reality that limit has already been eclipsed but due to accounting procedures by treasury secretary geithner the debt limit can be artificially avoided until congress must act now in order to avert a crisis never in the history of america has the united states defaulted on its debt obligations we must be clear on what this issue means for our country america has earned a reputation as the worlds most trusted borrower united states treasury bonds have traditionally been one of the safest investments another country or investor could make for investors around the world purchasing a unitedstates treasury bond meant that they held something virtually as safe as cash backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government in turn with the proceeds from the bonds the federal government of the worlds largest economy is able to finance its operations if the united states defaults on its debt obligations the financial crisis that began in 2008 would pale in comparison according to economic experts the ensuing economic catastrophe would not only place the unitedstates economy in a tailspin but the world economy as well the fact that congress a body that typically has its fair share of political battles has never played political chicken when it came to raising the debt ceiling should give us all pause and is a testament to the seriousness with which we must approach this issue however this time around my republican colleagues have created an impasse based upon an ideological commitment to spending cuts while i understand and share the concern of my republican colleagues with respect to deficit spending and will continue to work with them in order to find reductions now is not the time to put ideology over pragmatism the reality is that on august 3rd the united states will begin to default on its debt obligations if the debt ceiling is not raised this unnecessarily places the american public and the economy between a rock and a hard place either congress sides completely with the radical agenda of the tea party which irresponsibly pulls the chair out from under the average american while polishing the throne of the wealthiest this detour into a spending debate is as unnecessary as it is perilous as increasing the debt ceiling does not obligate the undertaking of any new spending by the federal government rather raising the debt limit simply allows the government to pay existing legal obligations promised to debt holders that were already agreed to by presidents and congresses both past and present moreover the impending crisis would have already occurred were it not for the extraordinary measures taken by treasury secretary timothy geithner including the suspension of the investment in securities to finance the civil service retirement and disability fund as well as the redemption of a portion of those securities already held by that fund if the united states defaults on its obligations on august 3rd the stock market will react violently to the news that for the first time in history america is unable to keep its promises to pay not once in american history has the countrys full faith and credit been called into question once america defaults investors who purchase unitedstates bonds and finance our government will be less likely to lend to america in the future just as a person who defaults on a loan will find it harder to convince banks to lend them money in the future a country that defaults on its debt obligations will find it harder to convince investors to lend money to a government that did not pay showing the world that the united states does not pay its debts makes the purchasing of that debt less desirable because it requires the assumption of more risk on the part of the investors the proponents of this bill are putting the country at serious risk of losing its status as the worlds economic superpower our allies will lose faith in our ability to manage global economic affairs our status in the world will be diminished which will undermine our leverage on the world stage that allows us to command the respect and compliance of other nations when it comes to decisionmaking this bill will reduce americas ability to compete with a surging china furthermore any investors that do continue to purchase unitedstates treasury bonds will demand much higher interest rates in order to cover the increased risk once a default occurs investors figure that the chance of the united states defaulting again is much greater and will require the government to pay higher rates of interest in order to make the loan worth the risk for investors to take on imagine the impact on our stock market if we do not pay our debts as we have seen throughout the recent financial crisis a bad stock market hurts not only big businesses and large investors on wall street but small businesses and small investors as well families with investments tied to the stock market such as 401 k s pension plans and savings will once again see the value of their investments drop the american people are tired of the uncertainty of the value of their retirement accounts we must not allow another wild fluctuation to occur due to default and add to the uncertainty still lingering in the minds of citizens the speakers plan is a short term fix for a long term issue it is a patch rather than a proper repair boehners plan requires that congress address debtceiling once again in a short span of time which will once again lead to market uncertainty in a time when we are trying to rebuild our nation this plan is not good for wall street and it is not good for the american people the speakers bill is a shortterm debt limit increase that will only ensure that congress will go through this exact same standoff again in the next few months shortterm proposals risk further uncertainty and the potentially damaging downgrade of the unitedstates credit rating the markets have made it clear that a shortterm extension is not sufficient and could result in very serious consequences while democrats support deficit reduction we support doing it in a balanced way that provides certainty to the economy as if another stock market crisis were not enough the housing market would take another hit if america defaulted higher mortgage rates in a housing market already weakened by default and foreclosures would cause a further depression of home values destroying whatever equity families might have left in their homes after the housing crisis moreover the longterm effects would reduce spending and investment in the housing market increasing the debt ceiling is the responsible thing to do congress has already debated and approved the debt that an increased ceiling makes room for however my republican colleagues have chosen to use this as an opportunity to hold the american people hostage to their extreme agenda even prominent republicans like senator john mccain and christine todd whitman have criticized the radical elements of their party who insist upon holding up the entire political process in order to flaunt their extreme irrational and unrealistic ideology senator mccain has called the tea partys stance and the way they have conducted themselves during this manufactured crisis bizarre and i am inclined to agree their agenda for this country is even too radical for speaker boehner with the tea party vowing to reject their leaders own bill they live in a world that is not the world that the american people live in in their world they believe that taxes are always too high even on people making over a billion a year in a struggling economy that any increase in revenue is fundamentally wrong even if it comes from large corporations who use tax loopholes at the expense of our jobcreating small businesses that investing anything in our economic future above tax revenues is impermissible even in the midst of an economic downturn and that tax cuts for the wealthy are always the nations top priority even at the expense of people that depend on social security medicare medicaid and veterans benefits to survive these beliefs place them on the fringe of american society and yet due to the nature our political process they have held up the entire government and placed our economy on the precipice of a turbulent second recession if congress cannot find a resolution then congress will open the possibility that the president may invoke the fourteenth amendment to united states constitution section four which states the validity of the public debt of the united states shall not be questioned the argument can be made that if congress will not resolve our nations pending default then the president to protect the interest of our nation must act the president would then have to consider his powers under the fourteenth amendment which may grant him the authority to raise the debt ceiling on his own through executive order and if congress fails to raise the debt limit by the august 2 2011 deadline as a body we should not place the president or our country in this position for those reasons i urge my colleagues to consider the constituents in their home districts who would be hurt by this bill i urge my colleagues to return to the world in which the vast majority of americans live in a world in which our shared destiny is determined by reasonable minds and good faith efforts to compromise federal reserve chairman ben bernanke warned that defaulting could throw the financial system into chaos and destroy the trust and confidence that global investors have in treasury securities as being the safest liquid assets in the world instead of injecting ideological spending cuts and constitutional amendments into the traditionally nonpolitical business of raising the debt ceiling we must work quickly to pass a bill that makes good on our debt obligations and restores confidence in american credit"], [9.119510650634766e-05, 0.9999088048934937, 1, "i rise in opposition to the underlying bill mr chair i rise today in defense of 76 000

heard many times over the past couple of weeks to govern is to choose last year as the nation well knows the choice by our friends across the aisle was to do no budget at all the democrats failed in perhaps their most basic responsibility now continuing in this line of inaction the president gave a speech yesterday with much preceding hype but again the defining aspect of the speech was no plan our rudderless president decided to take the two biggest drivers of our national debt medicare and social security and take them off the table his solution to addressing health care costs is further empowering the independent payment advisory board to ration health care instead of dealing with structural reforms what this all means is that we have a stark choice a choice of two futures one future is the presidents plan the one in red here the plan by the house democrats thats a path to national bankruptcy the other choice is a path to prosperity the green that gets us on a path to a balanced budget its time to address the american people in an honest and a factual manner lets face it the american people are sick and tired of washingtons gimmicks and empty promises and the path to prosperity is a bold vision for the future which relies upon facts not dishonesty as a physician i could tell you that obamacare is a threat to the affordability and accessibility and quality of health care all the principles that we hold dear in american medicine the facts are that obamacare is a violation of these principles and it takes away choices from patients and doctors while saddling workers and job creators and taxpayers with trillions of dollars in costs so we completely repeal and defund obamacare further we will save and preserve medicare for future generations by providing commonsense solutions so that folks have essentially the same kinds of health care choices that members of congress have its imperative that people recognize that no changes are made that would affect those in or near retirement now many folks on the other side of the aisle would rather bury their heads in the sand and ignore the reforms that need to be made to medicare the president has even decided to take it off the table but the facts are that the current medicare spending is growing at a rate twice as fast as the nations economy ten thousand baby boomers are reaching retirement age every single day as a physician when i talk to medicare patients in my district back home they tell me that they cant even find a doctor who is taking new medicare patients the system is broken and

policy wonk to know that the unitedstates economy is still struggling to rebound millions of americans are still unemployed or underemployed that this congress has not spent every single day of the last year and a half fighting to put people back to work is unconscionable and now instead of fighting for goodpaying american jobs republicans are launching their 31st attempt to repeal the affordable care act first the republicans said the law was unconstitutional the supreme court said they were wrong next republicans said the law was too expensive the congressional budget office said they were wrong now republicans say the law will raise taxes on millions of middle class families the urban institute says they are wrong estimating that a mere 3 percent of americans under 65 will face the choice between purchasing insurance and paying a penalty lets review what the affordable care act actually does we know it extends health insurance to 32 million uninsured americans which will prevent the unnecessary deaths of 45 000 people who die each year because they lack health insurance we know it will enable millions of americans with preexisting medical conditions to get insurance this has gotten publicity also every middle class family today is one cancer diagnosis away from bankruptcy fiftyfive percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused by health care emergencies and 75 percent of these bankruptcies are of people who had health insurance but health insurance that proved inadequate to cover an expensive disease like cancer by preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions and by eliminating the annual and lifetime caps on coverage found in most current policies the affordable care act will guarantee that middle class families will no longer have to fear going broke because of an expensive illness despite all of the benefits of this law republicans have decided the whole law must go fine they want to repeal and replace replace it with what what is the republican plan to stem the everrising cost of health care in this country and to reduce outofpocket health costs what is the republican plan to help millions more americans gain access to health insurance what is the republican plan to end discrimination in the insurance market for women for those with preexisting conditions for those who are sick and going broke with medical bills and those who die because of lack of care there is none the simple truth is that the republicans have no plan i urge my republican colleagues to do something new to try something novel instead of going to their familiar well of electionyear politics and a steady stream of no lets try to work together lets not turn a blind eye on the problem and hope it goes away lets not be indifferent to 45 000 unnecessary deaths of americans every single year i urge my colleagues to vote no on this repeal bill so that we can move on to fighting for american jobs and we can move on to assuring the middle class that they wont go broke because of an expensive illness and to assuring 30 million americans that they can get health insurance when they need it"]],

something to change social security and medicare and all these things he agreed to do publicly but the republicansjohn boehnercould never go against grover norquist the republicans shake in their boots they will not do anything even though the american people by a more than 70 percent majority say people making more than 1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are in this country so that fell apart then we had the gang of 6 senatorsthree republicans three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of poverty no segment of the population is immune from this painful absurd republican planexcept maybe millionaires billionaires and wealthy corporations the republican proposal cuts meals on wheels and reduces food assistance for almost 2 million needy people one of the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and in addition to what i have already mentioned this thing that they are taking up in the house today cuts off almost 300 000 children from free school lunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops said the republican plan fails a basic moral test this budget sets very clear priorities the problem is what they are taking up in the house sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people a nation does not have to be cruel to be tough so republicans would do well to remember our

is a map of arizona and the portions of arizona where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans and thats just the way it is"], [0.9714796915650368, 0.028520308434963226, 1, "referred to this simple onesentence resolution as unprecedented and i believe that it probably is unprecedented what it saysi mean i have almost memorized the one sentence it says that we need to make sure that the budget committee and the appropriations committee work to get us to 2008 spending levels or less i personally believe that we should be substantially below 2008 levels i believe that we need to take that kind of action and its true before the president stands right over my shoulder at 9 oclock this evening and delivers his state of the union message we want this institution to have a chance to go on record saying that we are committed to doing everything that we can to get the spending levels to 2008 or less now we are in the position we are and that itself is unprecedented and thats why unprecedented action is necessary now i began my remarks by talking about the fact that probably one of the most enduring and powerful memories of 2010 was what took place in athens greece we saw the riots take place in the streets from public service employees in the wake of the government facing the responsibility of imposing austerity standards on the people of greece and what happened we saw this huge outcry come because they were arguing that they couldnt in fact bring about cuts in spending i juxtapose that to what we saw in the last year here we saw tens of thousands of americans taking to the streets carrying this message taxed enough already they came together to petition their government to bring about spending reductions not complaining that the government was making cuts complaining that the government wasnt making enough cuts and thats exactly what were doing in fact i believe that this may be the first time in human history that we have witnessed what it was that we saw take place last year and led to the outcome in the november 2 election we know that the greatest change in threequarters of a century took place in this institution sixtythree members of the democratic party were defeated we now have 87 new republicans and nine new democrats who have joined with us and they have carried this message to us that we need to rein in spending now i think its important to note that our real goal is above that it is job creation and economic growth getting our economy back on track so that people out there who are trying to get onto the first rung of the economic ladder are able do just that we have a painfully high unemployment rate and people across this country are hurting now what steps can we take to create jobs i personally believe that we need toand i look forward to having the president talk about this tonightopen up new markets around the world so that union and nonunion workers in the united states of america can have the opportunity to sell goods and provide services into countries like colombia and panama and south korea where these pending agreements exist i believe that since japan has brought about a reduction in its top corporate rate the rate of those job creators we can reduce the top corporate rateits the highest rate of any country in the world nowfrom 35 to 25 percent i understand the president may be proposing that this evening that will go a long way towards creating jobs but what were doing with h res 38 is we are getting ourselves on a path towards fiscal responsibility and i believe that that is one of the most important things that we can do as we seek this shared goal of job creation and economic growth so if we can let this institution go on record in support of getting to 2008 levels or less i am convinced that that will be a strong step towards our goal our shared goal of creating jobs and establishing economic growth this is the beginning of a process the beginning of a process again a onesentence resolution that this house will be voting on in just a few minutes but the process itself is one that is broken its broken because for the first time since the 1974 budget act was put into place weve not had a budget weve not had a budget were almost 5 months into the new fiscal year and we are in the process of cleaning up the mess that was handed to us so how is it we plan to do it well speaker boehner has made it very clear and that is that we need to make sure that we have an open freeflowing debate as we proceed with a budget and im convinced that our rules committee will make alternatives in order when we proceed with the work that the budget committee will have done and im convinced that we will get back to the kind of regular order that i think today democrats and republicans alike would want to see and that is a chance for democrats and republicans to stand up and offer amendments to the appropriations bills so i will say again that its a simple onesentence resolution are we going to let this institution get onto a path towards reducing the size scope reach and control of the federal government or are we not and so i am going to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this very very important resolution"], [0.9712206777185202, 0.028779322281479836, 1, "and i do this very

struck and killed by a pickup truck while exiting a school bus and this particular section of the bill deals with the report language that talks about among other things the ability to talk about safety and pupil transportation relating to the national highway transportation safety administration so to understand the purpose behind this amendment its important to know how this tragedy happened this young girl was crossing the street to board her school bus the bus had its red lights flashing the stop arm was activated and a pickup truck traveling at 60 miles an hour struck and killed her the driver tested positive for marijuana and later pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and has been sentenced to 15 years in prison now this is one isolated incident in my home state but statistics show that 13 million violations occur in this country every year of vehicles passing stopped school buses its obvious we have a serious problem and my amendment would use this funding for the purpose of working with states to create tougher sanctions and tougher enforcement to reduce this alarming problem of people violating the law and passing stopped school buses the intent of my amendment is to require the national highway traffic safety administration otherwise known as nhtsa to prioritize at least 10 million for school bus safety work and specifically to work with state and local law enforcement to improve enforcement of state law concerning illegally passing stopped school buses my amendment would ensure that we are enforcing the laws on the books pertaining to stopping those school buses its a part of an ongoing effort to provide safety to kids who are going to school and returning every day 13 million violations a year is way too many we have an obligation to work with states my amendment would do that by directing nhtsa to use this opportunity to help those states become more effective in preventing these tragedies it wasnt the only one that has become of
