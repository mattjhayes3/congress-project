and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes vote i invite every democrat to join with republicans let us vote to eliminate the marriage

congress i am pleased that the presidential and executive financial accountability act is before us today the other body was unable to take up this important legislation in the last congress this legislation brings the agencies of the executive office of the president under the requirements of the chief financial officers or cfo act the cfo act was inspired by the realization that billions of dollars was lost through waste fraud and abuse in the federal government each year as chairman of the results caucus a bipartisan team of members focused on ridding our federal government of its major management problems i have seen report after report which has focused on insufficient and inefficient financial management systems that fail to produce consistent and reliable data in fact the general accounting office in a report issued in january of this year gave details about the department of defenses accounting system it reported that over 9 billion in known military operating materials and supplies were not reported that same defense department did not have reliable information on important items of inventory including the number and location of military equipment items such as f4 engines and service craft the cfo act was designed to improve financial management and to coordinate internal controls and financial accounting chief financial officers oversee all financial management activities in their agencies and report directly to the head of an agency on financial matters it certainly is clear that such practices are needed in the white house this legislation fixes a4 oversight in the original cfo act unfortunately the original act never applied to the executive office of the president h r 437 the presidential and executive office accountability act of 1999 will do so in a way that recognizes that unique circumstances of that office exist it will establish a chief financial officer in the executive offices of the president and will review and audit the white houses financial systems and its records the cfo duties are to comply with those requirements set forth in the cfo act but is limited by discretion of the president when the annual fiscal report on the federal government was recently released the government accounting office told us that significant financial system weaknesses problems with fundamental record keeping incomplete documentation and weak internal controls including computer reports prevent thb government from accurately reporting a large portion of its assets liabilities and costs in other words this administration cannot tell you how much money it receives how much money it spends and what it spends its money on what property it owns where that property goes or how much that property is worth there is no evidence that the executive offices at the white house are any different from those reports that have been issued already passage of this bill is another signal to the taxpayers that we will ferret out waste fraud and abuse wherever it is found once again the white house is not immune to this and thus is no different than any other agency mismanagement is found throughout the executive branch also investigation after investigation has turned over evidence of waste fraud and abuse the white house travel office the white house communications agency the fbi files matter are all evidence that the white house

focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax

bill does not work it has been a failure since it was enacted in 1996 the promise was produce what you want we will sell it overseas and get rid of the farm program and things will be better off since that time prices have collapsed and family farmers have had an awful time trying to make ends meet in most cases they are receiving far less now in real terms than they received during the great depression for their product these are not people who are slothful these are not people who arent being productive they are economic allstars they produce in prodigious quantity the food the world needs so desperately yet the market says by the way your food has no value while people climb trees to pick leaves to eat in countries around the world where there is not enough food family farmers driving a 2ton truck to a country elevator are told by the grain trader your food has no value something is wrong with that what really has no value is the current farm program it doesnt work it is long past time to fix it we are within three or four votes of doing that i encourage help from the other side to give us the votes needed to pass a farm program that provides real assistance for family farmers while we are on the subject of freedom those who wrote the freedom to farm billi didnt and i voted against itshould understand there is something called the freedom to sell the freedom to sell means if you want to give family farmers the freedom to produce whatever lets also give them the freedom to sell their products in markets such as iran iraq cuba north korea and others that have been off limits to them because this country has imposed economic sanctions against countries whose behavior we dont like i am fine with economic sanctions slap them with sanctions but dont ever include food as a part of those sanctions using food as a weapon is unbecoming to this country a country as big and as good and as powerful and as important as this country ought never use food as a

classroom with 1 teacher and 30 kids class size matters we have proposals to reduce class size which will dramatically improve education we also understand you cannot learn in schools that are in functional disrepair no wonder there is disrepair in the schools they were built 50 or 60 years ago after world war ii when we had soldiers coming back having families and building schools for their children all across the country many of these schools are still in use today and are in desperate need of repair and remodeling if anyone doubts that take a trip to the ojibwa school on the turtle mountain indian reservation or the cannon ball elementary school south of bismarck nd take a look at those schools and ask yourself whether those schools need help the third grader who walks through the classroom door in the cannon ball school ought to be able to expect the same opportunity for a good education as all kids in this country yet these children dont have the same opportunity we know that yet legislation to improve and modernize our schools languish in this senate because some people dont believe it is important or some people believe they cannot do it because if they did somebody

time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 4542 to designate the washington opera in washington d c as the national opera the beginnings of the washington opera were unusual as it was founded by a music critic day thorpe of the now defunct washington star along with a few others who decided that the nations capital should have an operatic enterprise of its own in the early years the washington opera was limited by financial and practical constraints to no more than one or two productions per year since that time the washington opera has grown and prospered today it is the resident opera company of the kennedy center due primarily to the artistic excellence of the ensemble in addition to performances the washington opera has created several education and community programs that serve a broad and diverse population these outreach programs are dedicated to enhancing the lives and learning of the children and adults of the greater washington region developing future audiences and making the experience of opera available to those who otherwise have limited access to this art form through these programs the washington opera has made extensive outreach to the washington d c area public schools and to the community at large these programs have reached more than 150 000 individuals and have been driven by the idea that learning by doing is a highly effective way to spark young childrens interest in the arts the number and scope of programming has grown to 22 programs that provide performance experiences currieulum enhancement activities inschool artist and docent visits professional development opportunities for teachers and young artists interactive familyoriented presentations and more under the stewardship of artistic director placido domingo the washington opera has achieved the stature of a worldclass company and plays to standingroomonly audiences at the kennedy center opera house and eisenhower theater i would like to mention a personal note about this artistic director placido domingo when my daughter at 17 was playing the professional tour i did not have the money to send a coach or anybody in the family so i gave her a lot of advice about not paying too much attention to anybody particularly men as she moved from the italian open to the swiss open to the german open and then to the french open and when she was leaving the french open to go to the paris open she apparently was standing there in tears and this gentleman asked her what was her problem and she said well my luggage went the other way and i have to play the first round of the french open as soon as i get to paris the gentleman said well the first thing we have to do is put you in first class because you cannot be cramped up back there and then go play tennis well if the father had known that he really would have been upset about some man moving her to first class when she got to paris the gentleman gave her a hundred dollars and she said well i cannot take that and he said well how will you play you only have your racket and your sneakers you will have to buy clothing when she came back and we were sitting there as a family watching television placido domingo and johnny denver were doing a couple of the duets that they have done and she said dad that is the man that put me in first class and that is the man who gave me the 100 and it was placido domingo and i understand that is typical of him the washington opera has earned its position of leadership in the musical world without the government support typical in most world capitals the company has been a leader through its commitment to sustain new american operas by presenting them in crucial second productions giving these new works life beyond the short span of their premieres it leads by championing the lesser known works of significant musical work rarely presented on todays opera stages it has been hailed for its work with operas on the epic scale as the british magazine opera now

the bipartisan support that i believe will emerge in this house later on but that took us so long to get here i was shocked and saddened when i saw the results of a recent poll conducted by the center for security policy their survey of 800 registered voters revealed a number of very troubling public misconceptions when asked hypothetically about a ballistic missile system and if it were fired at the unitedstates 54 percent of those polled believe we could destroy that missile before it caused any damage over half of those polled believe we were capable of protecting ourselves from a ballistic missile attack and of course the sad reality is that we cannot and when respondents learned this fact that we could not 19 percent were shocked or angry 28 percent said they were very surprised 17 percent said they were somewhat surprised i do not know what i find more troubling the fact that so many people incorrectly believe that we can protect ourselves from missile attack or the lack of outrage on the part of so many leaders of the fact that we cannot the evidence is overwhelming the threat of attack is increasing concerns over russias control over its nuclear arsenal continue to grow china continues to develop weapons of mass destruction north korea recently demonstrated that its missiles are capable of striking alaska and hawaii and as we know iran and iraq are working to
