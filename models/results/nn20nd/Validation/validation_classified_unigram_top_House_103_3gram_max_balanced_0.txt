prove honest able uncoln wrong president clinton through his false gimmick packaging is trying to sell the american people into believing that his huge tax hike the largest in american history will go towards reducing the federal deficit president clinton and the democrats are conning the american people and this is why i checked with my doctors yesterday to get their approval to cast my vote against president clintons budget this vote is the first i have made since i underwent triple bypass surgery on july 16 to remove arterial blockage i believe this vote is crucial to my constituents and the country and this is why i am here before you instead of at home recuperating the democratic leadership claim that the goal of the clintons tax package is to pare 500 billion from the federal debt over the next 5 years what president clinton and the democrats fall to say is that even if they pass the presidents budget the nations debt will still increase by a staggering 1 2 tillion if this doublespeak is not insulting enough to the intelligence of taxpayers clinton and the democrats are trying to pull a fast one on american families and businesses by frontloading 275 billion of gross tax increases without significant spending cuts the clinton tax package heaps taxes on americans already struggling to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their families rather than making americans pay their fair share the clinton tax plan will ensure that americans will be sharing most of their income with the federal government maybe the president and the democratic leadership in congress have convinced themselves of this but my constituents are not persuaded history has demonstrated to us time and time again that increasing taxes does not reduce the deficit higher taxes means increased spending i ask you my colleagues the question my constituents have asked me how can these tax increases be justified with the knowledge that no mechanisms exist to cut spending in the budget three parts of this budget represent a particularly onerous tax burden that will affect the middle class seniors and anyone else in america who breathes the gas tax the social security tax and surprising new retroactive taxes first the gas tax this federal gasoline tax of 4 3 cents per gallon will be more burdensome to families living in the large states of the west and south california will not escape the affect of this tax this increase will tax gasoline diesel compressed natural gas and noncommercial aviation fuel california will be hit extremely hard since it has a large population that utilizes various forms of transportation transportation costs will inevitably increase the clinton energy tax is inflationary and will escalate the already spiralling tax burden passed on to american families the energy tax will stifle the economic recovery we see occurring right now according to the tax foundation it is estimated that 54 299 jobs will be lost in my state of california behind every number there is a human face a family someone who can blame their unemployment on clintons tax package next the tax on social security benefits or if you listen to the president a spending cut seniors will be penalized for working and saving for their retirement under the clinton tax plan even though in his manifest putting people first candidate clinton promised to protect the integrity of the social security trust fund he hag decided to balance the budget on backs of senors cintons proposal will affect seniors with incomes of over 32 000 or coups incomes over 44 000 by inrea the tax on 85 percent of their social secuty benefits in addition to this these taxes increase the elderly surtax on pensions ira withdrawals interest from municipal bonds and certifcates of deposit the tax revenues generated by these new taxes on seniors will then be used to fund other programs rather than going into the socal security trust fund the president should not wonder as he pillages senlors benefits to pay for other programs why in addition to te budget deficit he also must contend with the trust fund this elderly surtax is anything but fair the increase in the elderly surtax hits the prudent and frugel who live on ixed incomes accordlng to the heritage foundation it is estimated that in calilomia 566 328 households over 65 with incomes greater than 3 000 will be hit and more spedlically in my district 13 884 households affected the 29 billion clinton hope to rsm at the expense of our seniors could easily be achieved by implementing just a handful of seniors wastecuting recommendations that have been put before him seniors should be appalled that a president who was not even born while many of them were fighting in world wars to make the world safe for democracy and wordng to feed their families is now trying to pick their pockets to pay for his new spending programs ad speaking of new taxes id like to call my colleagues attention to language ticked away in the budget reconcillatlon bill the measure imposes an unfair rate increase in estate gift and generallonskipping taxes th would be retroactive to january 1 1993 the proposed

would think you have to ask the question why hasnt this issue been passed and why isnt it behind us well because at that point my friends the issue was not right there was an ongoing investigation by the unitedstates attorney for the district of columbia and when these resolution came up in the past we were advised not by a democrat not to move ahead but at that point it was a republican appointee who said do not move ahead this could hamper my criminal investigation of this matter so we heeded the advice of that unitedstates attorney and the one who came after him but however things have changed to the point where he did send a letter which i read today indicating that for purposes of my investigation an indictment has been issued and now it is my belief that these records can be released and that is what we are doing today so to go back over the last couple of years and continue to harp about something that did not occur that is the reason why it did not occur in 1992 we had 2 votes on release of the transcripts my colleague the gentleman from washington mr svqfrl is correct the minority counsel on that committee told the witnesses what i was there for that their testimony would be held confidential and so we had a vote on july 22nd of 1992 to willy nilly release all the testimony from the witnesses and representative swrft from washington opposed that as i did indicating wait a minute folks that wasnt the deal that wasnt what we told these people we told them that what they told us would be confidential well what did they tell us everything they snipped on the guy next door who came in late about this guy using a vehicle and all sorts of stuff then they went above and beyond that things that had very little to do with the post office operation itself so we defeated those two attempts to just willy nilly release the testimony of those employs who were told that what they told us would be confidential i support the resolution today because it has

this bill also contains a provision dealing with the definition of wireless cable which is very similar to a bill h r 759 that rick boucher and i introduced and which was part of the overall hearings

of the copyright act the compromise before us today provides that wireless and other cablelike systems will be made part of the compulsory license i believe its important to encourage these new technologies because they will become real competitors of cable tv in the marketplace competition is an important factor in keeping cable tv rates at a reasonable price the consumer will be the ultimate benefactor of this increase in competition in 1988 when we drafted the original satellite home viewer act we intended that after 6 years the industry involved would be able to move into

violation of house rules which prevent authorizing on an appropriations bill by now most of my colleagues know that i have continually argued that the interior appropriations bill is not the appropriate vehicle to consider this controversial issue congress should not preempt the administrations attempt to address the federal grazing fee issue this year nor should we attempt to endrun the authorizing committee and finally an arbitrary untested and drastic increase in grazing fees would unravel the already marginal economic condition of many western rural communities the public landsranchers need a predictable and stable fee structure based on market conditions for which the banks will lend them money to make improvements on the range if it werent for these ranchers the land would remain barren and vacant without anyone to watch over it on a daily basis and if we force ranchers off the public lands in the west the resulting loss of revenues to the federal and state governments will be significant i do not believe it is in this nations best interest to force these stewards out of business in the west we depend on them and this fee increase which congress considers annually deprives local communities of all stability and predictability next i would also like to alert chairman yates and mr regula to a disturbing trend in the allocation of funds for the southwest region of the forest service it has come to my attention that funding for the southwest region when compared to funds allocated to other forest service reglons is grossly inequitable i want

than does the southwest region s95 2 versus 56 3 million in fiscal year 1993and indications are that this will occur again in fiscal year 1994 i would like to make the point that the methods used to evaluate the funding needs of one region should apply to all of the regions in fact this same inequality and disproportionate funding occurs in the southwest regions range management recreation watershed and road management accounts when compared to the other forest service regions i would like to submit for the record a detailed comparison of each of the nontimberrelated categories this is not a newly transformed bias the southwest region has historically been treated like a stepchild i want to assure you that i am not arguing to cut any other regions federal funding all i want is a formula that offers the southwest region a fair share again i would appreciate chairman yates and mr regulas attention to this matter and hope that we can find some acconmmi odation by the time this
