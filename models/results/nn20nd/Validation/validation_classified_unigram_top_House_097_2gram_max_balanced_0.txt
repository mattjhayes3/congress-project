people forcefully delivered a message to all of us about the state of the economy the tax load on the average american worker and runaway federal spending there is no one in this chamber who failed to understand what the overwhelming majority of americans were saying american taxpayers want changeand relief from the crushing economic burdens they bear and they expect us to do our jobs and give it to them seven years ago this house created the mechanism to do just that in 1974 the congress faced up to the need to gain control of the budgetary process for the first time it revamped its budgeting procedures created a system of setting target ceilings and wrote into being the reconciliation process but for 7 years congress ignored that procedure once it had been enacted business went on as usual and federal spending continued to spiral out of control doubledigit inflation and the crushing tax burden the american people voted so strongly against last fall were the direct result of that program of spend and spend and spend throughout those 7 years the procedure to control that spending was on the books now it is being used as it was intended to be throughout all that period for the first time president reagan with the support of republicans and responsible members of the democratic majority intends to live up to those expectations of the american people it is the height of irony now to hear some of those very same members who wrote the budgetary reforms in the first place and who voted them into law protest that the process is being abusedsimply because it is being used as it was meant to be for the first time we face very real and very growing problems during the next several fiscal years unless we move right now to gain control of the federal spending process that budget control mechanism the congress created 7 years ago with its essential reconciliation component can impose needed fiscal discipline on the congress for the first time we know that the job has to be done this countrys economy is in deep need of major stimulation we are all encouraged in the improvement in the inflation rate during the past 3 months but there is no one in this chamber who does not fully understand the great need for tax reforms and investment incentives to get the economy truly moving once again a major element of any such package must be a cut in federal spending that requirement is underlined by this nations need to enhance its spending on defense for the past several years we have allowed our military to fall behind the crucial demands it faces in an increasingly dangerous world we know that we cannot continue uncontrolled spending on every program ever suggested and meet those most immediate needs as well we have to cut the growth in other federal spending programs if we are going to be able to spend the extra 191 billion president reagan says is needed during the next 5 years to bring the military back from the depths to which the carter administration allowed our defenses to fall we will not be able to accomplish that badly needed task unless we regain control of the federal spending process a number of the house committees have done an admirable job in working toward that goal during the reconciliation process i want to congratulate them today for the work they have done republicans are not attempting to dictate the terms of the reconciliation bill we understand that bringing the budget into balance with the budget authorization ceiling congress enacted in may requires a process of conciliation and compromise but we insist that the house of represertatives live up to the commitments it made to the american people 7 years ago when it adopted that budget reform package and in may when it enacted that budget ceiling to meet those desires the american people expressed so clearly last november it took the congress 25 years to spend this country into the fiscal mess the american worker faces today we know and those american workers know that those problems are not going to be solved overnight or in a single years budget all of us know that spending cuts such as those being proposed today are going to have to be repeated for the next several years to make a dent in the economic problems we face we are going to have to cut the growth of most federal spending programs in fiscal 1982 and fiscal 1983 and fiscal 1984 and probably beyond if we are to slow inflation and halt the everincreasing load of taxes on the backs of those american workers we know as well that the job is not going to be an easy one that job is going to be even more difficult however if we give in to temptation and put off starting the work until next year that will be an election year does anyone here seriously think the congress will be willing to start cutting budgets in the middle of an election campaign at a time when the social security system will be on the verge of collapse unless we have the courage to face the taskthe same sort of courage president reagan showed when he brought that problem to our attention this spring what we are unwilling to start this year will be even more difficult to begin in 1982 and we ought to be honest enough with ourselves our colleagues and the american worker and taxpayer to admit that here today we will not make that needed beginning by caving in to the democratic leadership of the house as several of our committees have done and adopting spending cuts that are false counterproductive and which will actually force spending and inflationary increases we will not make that needed beginning by playing politics as usual as the democratic leadership proposes to do in this budget reconciliation process and by continuing to push those uncontrolled spending programs of the past quarter century that have spent our nation into the economic poorhouse we will accomplish that needed beginning only by following the lead of those responsible committees which have lived up to our commitments to the american taxpayer the american people are watching and waiting and they want responsible action now it is time for all of us to live up to those commitments the house republican policy committee of which i am chairman has addressed these questions and has adopted an official policy statement on this issue the full text of the statement follows republicans welcome the first steps which have been taken to bring the budget reconciliation process into balance with the bipartisan budget ceiling resolution for fiscal 1982 supported by president reagan and adopted by congress last month major work remains to be done however if the growth of federal government spending is to be slowed to ease the runaway inflation and soaring taxes that have so sorely plagued american workers in recent years eight house committees have met the task of acting to cut spending program proposals to bring them into line with the budget ceiling resolution another seven however have fallen far short of that task in many cases they have acted in conjunction with the democratic leadership to continue what president reagan has aptly described as the fiscal joy ride this country has been on for the past several decades it is a breach of faith with those workers to adopt artificial spending cuts that do not bring spending decreasesor which actually add to federal spending unfortunately that is the course chosen by some of the democraticallycontrolled house committees as they continue to play politics as usual with the pocketbooks of american taxpayers rather than making good faith efforts to live up to the budget ceiling resolution adopted by congress the democratic leadership has chosen instead to propose completely unacceptable counterproductive and false spending cuts by some house committees one of the biggest reasons for the tremendous growth in government spending in recent decades has been the explosion in federal entitlement programs and their payments in trimming entitlements alone the spending proposals for fiscal 1982 of the democratic leadership fall 8 5 billion short of what is required under the budget resolution already enacted by the congress for the next three fiscal years those democratic entitlement proposals bust the budget ceilings by 23 billion the american taxpayer deserves far better the house republican policy committee supports the proposed bipartisan budget reconciliation package which will correct many of those spending abuses and which will bring the reconciliation process into line with the budget ceiling we urge all republican members to do the same the bipartisan package authored by reps delbert latta rohio and phil gramm dtexas and supported by the house republican policy committee will boost house committees real savings 5 2 billion in fiscal 1982 in the next three years the package will save american taxpayers more than 19 billion the house republican policy committee supports this approach of compromise and conciliation it rejects the idea that congress must capitulate to continued spending abuses in the fnce of the economic crisis facing all americans the bipartisan proposal supported by the iouse republican policy committee does not rewrite the entire budgetary work of house committees it simply improves on the initial work of the committees and spurns the fiscal games being played by the democratic leadership through its control of the house budget committee in addition the bipartisan package takes crucial steps toward cutting waste and inefficiencies in these federal programs it moves toward making these spending reductions permanent for the benefit of american taxpayers it accomplishes both these goals through the creation of needed block grant programs in the fields of health social services rehabilitation services energy assistance education and community development such block grant programs will vastly increase program flexibility at the state and local level while reducing overhead costs and inefficiencies in washington at the same time there is a strong need in this country to return control of such programs to those levels of government closest to the problems unfortunately the budget reconciliation package advanced by the democratic leadership shows no recognition of those needs this approach would be a major first step toward cutting the bureaucratic waste that has built up in more than 40 years of uncontrolled federal spending programs while at the same time protecting those americans in need from the loss of services the house republican policy committee endorses the bipartisan package containing both the additional cuts in spending propos als and block grant programs"], [6.80685043334961e-05, 0.9999319314956665, 1,

because i strongly support a reduction in federal taxes the republican package provides that tax relief the committee bill does not it provides little more than a promise i believe that president reagan called it an empty promise the republican package does just what its proponents claim it provides a real acrosstheboard federal tax reduction the committee bill endorsed by the liberal democratic leadership of the house is merely a political ploy to maintain the discredited status quo and create an obstacle in the path of president reagans program for economic recovery it is no more than an attempt to follow the businessasusual approach that the liberal majority in this house has followed for the last 25 years the american electorate soundly rejected the old liberal policy of taxing spending and electing at the polls last november now the leadership of the house is giving us the opportunity to again reject that stilldiscredited policy by voting down the committee bill and voting in favor of the conablehance substitute it seems that we have a problem of interpretation here let me attempt to clear it up when a conservative says he supports a tax cut he means just that a tax cut but when our liberal friends uncharacteristically begin talking about a tax cut they mean something else in this case they mean an elaborately designed package which will actually bring about a tax increase a couple of years down the road in looking over the ways and means committee bill i note that my own state of ohio will be penalized nearly 100 million in the next 3 years i do not buy that and i will not support it like most of my colleagues i listened to president reagans address on monday evening and to the democrat rebuttals which followed i was surprised to hear one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle proudly proclaiming that the democrats had enacted five tax cuts over the last 10 years surprised because federal taxes have actually increased by more than 400 billion in those 10 years i would imagine that most american taxpayers shared that surprise as they recalled handing over 25 or 30 or 40 percent of their income to the federal government in the form of taxes i was also surprised that my democratic colleagues chose to argue that the republican tax bill is geared toward the wealthy any member of congress who has followed tax legislation knows full well that threefourths of the republican tax cut will go to middleincome taxpayers those individuals who now pay 72 percent of all taxes will be the beneficiaries of 74 percent of the tax cut opponents of the conablehance substitute also claim that they are supporting a real tax reduction which will provide needed relief to the american taxpayers yet they fail to mention the builtin tax increase which will occur in the next 3 years as a result of inflation and the increase in payroll taxes the ways and mean committee bill provides for a 2year 15percent tax reduction while the 3year tax increase is estimated to be 22 percent you do not have to be a phi beta kappa to understand that the democrat tax package calls for a tax increase i would also like to briefly comment on the democrat claim that their bill is a tax bill for the average american taxpayer and the small businessman it is funny that my liberal colleagues should all of a sudden become the protector of the working man i do not know about the rest of the country but the working people in my state blame the congress for their economic troubles and the congressmen who have been writing the tax laws for the last 25 years are democrats those very democrats who gave us those five mythical tax cuts in the 1970s and those multibilliondollar federal deficits and that trillion dollar national debt and now they are the party of the working man i find that a little hard to swallow let us talk about the working productive american for a moment the autoworker who faces a 30percent unemployment rate in his industry the construction worker who in sonmc areas faces a 50percent unemployment rate how do you suppose it came to be that he has become increasingly concerned about whether or not his job will be there tomorrow whether or not he can make that house payment whether or not he can feed his family is it because the government taxed him too little is it because the government allowed him to keep too much of his money and spend it as he sees fit i think not if i had my way we would go even further on this tax cut we would cut deeper enough compromises have been made already if we are really serious about cutting taxes and getting this country back to work again we must adopt a multiyear tax cut for all americans we must adopt the republican substitute our president has kept his promise

follows the administrations economic program consists of supertight money a fiscal 1982 expenditure cut of around 50 billion in which military increases areoffset by cuts in the social budget and a 148 billion a year income tax reduction when fully effective in 1984 heavily weighted toward personal income tax cuts for the affluent is the program equitable will it work is there an alternative neither the proposed budget cuts not the proposed tax cuts are equitable no doubt cuts in budgetary expenditures are needed they are needed because the mandate of the november 1980 election is qite clear cut expenditures reduce the present federal take of some 23 percent of gross national product budget cuts are desirable too because of the need to get the deficit under control only a budget deficitwhfch is under control can eliminate the treasurys need to borrow heavily to meet the deficit with a lowered deficit the nations savings could get through to the needed ultimate investment in plant and equipment so the question is not whether there should be budgetary retrenchment the question rather is on whom the burden should fdl and here even a cursory look at the reagan budget shows that a disproportionate part of the cuts fails upon those in the dawn of life the children those in the twilight of life the elderly and those in the shadows of life the disadvantaged the handicapped and the poor health programs are ruthlessly cut med icaid is slashed 1 2 billion which means not only less medical care for the needy but a greater burden thrust upon state and local governments

corporation which has provided help for so many of the stormtossed who cannot afford a private lawyer is to be ended mass transit is drastically curtailed all these cuts could have aved some 50 billion and i have no qua el with the idea of a 50 billion deficitnarrowing measure but it would have been entirely possible to save that same 50 billion without shortchanging really needy people and without eviscerating programs which foster economaic development for example billions could have been saved by cutting down the federal tax deduction subsidy for interest paid on vacation homes sometimes the third and fourth such home and on interest pr~id largely by the top one~fiftb of income receivers on loaru to carry consumer purchases in addition to putting needed funds into the

cases porno bookstores uneconomic power projects like clich river in tennessee or corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation water projects bonanzas to the oil industry such as the depletion allowance which make no sense in a world where oil brings 40 a barrel but equity aside will the program work will it produce the victory over unemployment and inflation and budget deficits which reaganomics proclaims it will flaith over and beyond the call of duty is required to make one believe that it will the theory is that the supertight money will fight inflation and the superheavy tax cut will stimsulate growth much more likely the tight money and high interest rates wiill retard growth increase unemployment and bring about hankruptcies and the tax cut will simply stimulate higher interest rates if patterns in the current inflationary period are projected only about 5 percent of the total reduction will be nsaved by the beneficiaries of the reduction with the other 95 percent as a present spent indeed since much of it will be spent by the wealthy itis likely to be spent on expensive imported consumer goods ranging from mercedess to claret thus worsening our trade balance and the international dollar and in the next round inflation moreover even the uttle bit theoretically saved from current consumption may in todays inflation be spent by speculating in corporate takeovers or in commodit la such as bunker huntand his blillondollar silver manipulations the administration projects the 1984 workout of its policies as producing a balanced budget and inflation unemployment and interest rates all hovering around the 6 percent level the administration disdains econometric studies and derived its euphoric results largely by hoping or guessing that everyone would conclude from the reagan program that hard times were over businessmen should reduce their prices labor lower its wages and banks make available their money for lower interest rates a number of economic forecast4 rs who still hold the view that logical prediction is possible among them the congressional budget office data resources the wharton school and chase econometricscome up with vastly gloomier 1984 scenarios but these economic thinktanks in programming their computers all assumed that the reagan program in all its brute severity would not actually be carried out hence they softened the assumptions the federal reserve would actually not keep money as tight as the administration is ordaining congress would not by its spending and taxing measures allow the kind of budget deficits that reagan arithmetic postulates so al of these projections fell to take reaganomics nt its word however forbidding the word might be so i asked the joint economic committee staff to put into the computer the reagan program without improving a line of it and out came the result unemployment no better than today inflation down to 8 percent but underlying inflationthe general trend of wage ratesstill at its present 9 percentplus level ~ and a budget deficit of 111 billion the greatest in history rather than a budget in balance what would be happening the computers were telling us was that the reductions in social spending would be more than outweighed by the increases in military spending and the reductions in income tax revenue the added deficits coupled with a very stringent monetary policy would bring about high inbierest rates and slow growth these in turn would further increase the deficit in short the republicans far from learning by the mistakes of the democrats seem doomed to repeat them in 196l the democratic ndministration combined guns and butterguns for a major war in vietnam butter for a whole gamut of new social programs and the result was years of stagflation now fourteen years later along come the republicans and want to repeat the same mistakeguns for the greatest peacetime increase n military spending in history and butter in the form of outsized tax reductions for the affluent with a resulting renewed bout of stagfiation and budgetary deficits a particularly unfortunate element in reaganomics is what it will do to income distr~budion it is too much perhaps to hope for the moment that amnerica can achieve a fairer income distribution a diminution of the gap between rich and poor and a closer approximation to the situation which prevails in countries like germany and japan but income distribution in the united states has been getting worse for the last 16 years and now is certainly no time to accelerate the worsening during 19651978 the share in the national income earned by the lowest quintile of american families the poor remained about even but only because of the treniendous increase in transfer payments such as health welfare education food and housing benefits asto the second and third quintilesthose making 10 00020 000 a year and 20 00030 000 a year today respectivelythey definitely lost their share of the national income declined from 28 percent to 26 percent the fourth quintile those in the 30 00040 000 bracket just about kept even and the top quintile not surprisingly absorbed what the lower middle income second and thi1rd quintiles were losing it raised its share of the national income from 42 percent to 44 percenta total of many billions of dollars under reaganomics the people in the lowest 60 percent are going to lose more the poor will have their transfer payments shorn the second and third quintiles dont have those transfer payments to lose but they will get piddling income tax cut benefitsthe reductions from keniproth will be swallowed by the increases in the payroill tax and in inflationary bracket creep being borrowers rather than lenders they will be hurt by a perpetual high interest rate regime and the tax loopholes that gladden the hearts of the upper income bracketsitemized deductions oil and real estate shelters investment creditsare simply not available to them the top ten percent of american families will profit mightily from reaganomics with the lowest 60 percent taking it on the chin this does not sound like a good way to keep up the demand necessary to take off the market what the economy can produce and thus avoid a recession nor does it seem a good way to make for social peace either in the central city or in the lower middleclass suburbs the view that rehganomics in not likely to w~ork is not held just by congressional democrats reaganomics is also viewed with some private skepticism by a good many congressional republicans ranging from those on the moderate wing who see super tight mones as a real barrier to the necessary growth to those on the conservative wing like the three conservative republican senators who outraged the white house by voting against the budget on the senate budget committee just before the april recess who fear with considerable reason a huge reagan budget deficit down the road and many a market letter from many a respectable wall street firm nowadays is pointing out that the markets are not exactly prophesying success for reaganomics as indicated by the fact that longterm interest rates auguries of inflation have been stead ily rising since the inaugural the president in hisstate of the economy address on february 18 asked anybody with a better alternative to step forward and present it very recently the democrats led by chairman jones of the house budget committee and chairman itostenkowskl of the house ways and means committee have done just that mr jones proposes a slightly gentler hand on social program budget cuts than mr reagansomewhat on the order of 10 percent rather than 25 percent cuts for economic development mass transit food stamps school lunches legal aid and so on by cracking down on military waste and by mandating a somewhat smaller tax cut mr jones is aiso able to reduce the 1982 reagan budget deficit of 40 billion to 25 billion mr rostenkowski would cut 1982 taxes by only 40 billion rather than by mr reagans 52 billion and would shift the benef its very modestly from those at the top of the income scale to those in the middle the democratic alternative represents as does the democratic party nowadays a pale and somewhat more human imitation of the republican programa little tougher on fatcats a little easier on thincats and a bit more responsible about the deficit in short an improvement if hardly a call to the barricades while the two great parties of the middle square off on the minutia of macroeconomics nothing much is being done about the structural problems of our economy yet it is in improving our economic structure that the game will be won or lost for even the most admirable monetary and fiscal policies are insufficient to bring both steady jobs and stable prices at the same time the structural aspects of costpush inflation productivity energy and national defense must be addressed 1 against inflation our only policy is supertight money by itself as thatchers england is proving it cannot lay a glove on inflation without creating unacceptable stagflation recession and unemployment yet the administrations freemarket mythology immobilizes it from addressing the wagepice spiral in steel in automobiles in coal and in a score of other major sectors there are overseas examples of what to do about costpush inflation that we seem intent on ignoring in austria the government has for ycara successfully worked a social contract in which labor and management agree on a compact which puts a productivityrelated ceiling on the spiral in holland the government has had a comprehensive system of wage and price controls in place for the last couple of years and inflation is today less than 7 percent 2 in productivity we have only a fragmentary policy though accelerated productivity increases are one of the best inflationfighters going republicans and democrats are generally agreed on the need for liberalized depreciation for business investments and on the simplification and reformp of regulatory excesses but labormanagementgovernment cooperation for productivity improvement is still frowned on despite the splendid results of cooperation in the two postwar miracleworkers germany and japan in lsth these countries labor has been weened away from inefficient workrules and management from concentration on shortterm and financial fetishism why not hfarerica nor does the reagan budget do anything noticeable for productivity infrastructure programsrebuilding america ruined streets and bridges and sewer systems and waterworks and railroads and utilities and mass transitis badly shortchanged so is manpower training and industrial research and development both public and private 3 the administration is considering killing the department of energy but there is precious little of an energy policy to kill to stand up to opecand in the process make ourself the hero of the nonoilproducing worldwe need to build up a

about to remove the little that it hath 4 finally there are the economic and geographical implications of our shift of emphasis toward the military with our drastically increased military spending we may be in fact weakening our security by weakening our economy military hyperspending hits the most inflationary spots in the economy where skilled manpower and materials are scarcest military production unlike the production of civilian goods creates no pur chasable commodity to satisfy the money demand of the workers and entrepreneurs who make the military goods we had better find a way out of the arms race with the kremlin which we are now accelerating the political and economic unrest in poland brought us very close to the brink the soviet union must have come very near intervening

emphasize the importance of his message that he eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee

reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this

than at death will help preserve the structure of the independently owned business and farm tom hagedorn is the ranking minority member on the livestock dairy and poultry subcommittee as such he has been very instrumental in dealing with the major problems confronting these vital industries his accomplishments include introduction of a bill requiring humane treatment of horses being transported for the intention of slaughter recommendations to secretary of agriculture and the industry concerning the control and eradication of pseudorabies in swine exhorting the department of agriculture to use all existing and potential outlets to dispose of surplus dairy products cosponsorship a bill suspending import duties of sulfa drugs necessary for use by hog producers in treating their herds in addition mr hagedorn was a cosponsor of a bill to make improvements in current food safety laws mr iiagedorn was an ardent supporter of a move to cancel the grain embargo and has advocated increasing agricultural exports abroad particularly dairy products finally rom hagedorn has been a tireless legislator in the development of the 1981 farm bill he sought to develop a bill which will provide adequate stability and income protection while trying to operate within the budget restrictions to develop appropriate modifications and improvements that will enhance basic agricultural programs tom coleman of missouri has been the leader on the republican side when it comes to the food stamp prograin as the ranking republican on the domestic marketing consumer relations and nutrition subcommittee he has been in the forefront for reform of the food stamp program while insuring that this program also helps those poor elderly and disabled who are truly in need it was through his efforts that the omnibus reconciliation act contained true legislative form of the food stamp program rather than the artificial savings originally reported by the budget committee the reconcillation act included such major reforms as mandating retrospective accounting and periodic reporting for food stamp recipients elimination of boarders and outreach from the program tightening of tie eligibility criteria and provisions for a block grant for nutritional assistance for puerto rico savings for fiscal year 1982 for the food stamp program exceeded 1 6 billion in the reconciliation act due to toms leadership an additional 700 million was saved through legislation contained in the farm bill total savings for 1982 for the food stamp program exceeded 2 3 billion because of tom colemans desire to make sure that the food stamp program serves only those truly in need he has watched closely the activities of local state and federal agencies who are responsible for both program administration and the elimination of fraud from the program through these activities tom has observed the activities of the department of agricultures office of the inspector general although this is the one agency charged with the responsibility for investigating criminal fraud in the food stamp program it did not have basic law enforcement authority for pursuit of criminal fraud the usdas office of inspector general has originated and participated in criminal investigations of food stamp fraud resulting in almost 800 indictments in fiscal year 1981 they uncovered activities in which food stamps were sold at a discount and the money used to buy such items as guns and illegal drugs tom coleman has stated that food stamps are used just like moneythat they are a second currency in this countryand that this type of involvement by criminals in a program for lowincome people must be stopped therefore he introducted h r 4530 the food stamp law enforcement act of 1981 this legislation

week members of the steel caucus executive committee were most disturbed by press reports that the administration might settle its dispute over steel imports with the europeans through bilateral agreements which would not protect the interests of the american steel industry according to the reports much pressure was being exerted by the european economic community eec to reach a settlement that would prove unfavorable to our domestic producers consequently the executive committee met in an emergency meeting on thursday morning july 21 1982 and agreed unanimously to inform secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige of opposition to the european offer that same night secretary baldrige rejected the european offer to limit steel exports to 90 percent of the 1981 levels i would like to submit here for the record the official press release of the commerce department on this decision the unitedstates department of commerce could not accept a lastminute proposal by the european communities ec to suspend 12 steel countervailing duty cvd investigalions involving belgium france italy and the united kingdom because the legal requirement of removing the apparent injurious effects caused to the unitedstates industry by subsidized steel imports was not met the proposals were formally presented to commerce secretary malcolm baldrige at 5 30 thursday by the ambassadors of the four countries accompanied by representatives of the ec the contents of the proposals had been received that morning the ec requested that the commerce department suspend the investigation on the basis of quantitative restraint agreements as permitted in unitedstates law under that provision the deadline for reaching an agreement is midnight july 24 in announcing his decision baldrige said we welcome any attempt by the community to settle the unfair steel trade cases between the unitedstates and the ec but unfortunately these proposals are not legally acceptable unitedstates law requires that any quantitative restraint suspension agreement must eliminate the injurious effect of subsidized exports of the subject merchandise to the united states since the steel imports from the ec that caused the injury increased almost 30 percent from 1980 to 1981 the 10 percent reduction offered today from the higher 1981 levels was simply not sufficient to remove injury as required baldrige stated that if acceptable suspension agreements could have been concluded on these products the steel trade tension between the ec and the unitedstates would still not have been eliminated he noted that 19 antidumping ad cases on the same products and 13 other ad and cvd cases are still pending baldrige felt that an overall settlement leading to withdrawal of all cases was the best way to relieve the current trade tension and repeated his willingness to continue discussions with the ec to find an equitable basis to deal with the problem in its entirety as well as the proposed suspension agreements the ec required that the unitedstates accept all of the 12 proposed agreements or none in its decision the doc compared the ecs suggested restraint level to the levels at which the unitedstates international trade commission made preliminary determinations of injury in 1980 and 1982 most of the proposed restraint levels were above the levels found to be injurious by the itc doc also considered the current state of the unitedstates industry now running at less than 45 percent utilization and the level of subsidies found in the june 10 preliminary determinations which in one case amounts to 40 percent subsequent to that decision the secretary made a counterproposal to the eec that provided about a 20percent cut in steel imports unfortunately the europeans turned that proposal down in the meantime in accordance to the relevant trade laws future negotiations on these cases will require the commerce department to seek the approval of the domestic steel industry before reaching a settlement now i have been advised that the secretary will pursue additional discussions along these lines this week in brussels it would seem to be in the interests of the european community to 11 4692 co participate in these negotiations otherwise they will risk final determinations and penalties i urge the secretary to do everything in his power to settle these cases as soon as possible in order to get our steelworkers back on the job a mr bevill the war being waged against the american steel industry by foreign steel producers has taken yet another twist news reports indicate that several of the european governments which have been accused of subsidizing their steel mills and permitting them to dump their steel in this country at prices far below production costs have been applying equally unfair pressure on this government to let them plea bargain their way out of the trade suits filed against them these news reports indicate that the europeans have used the russian gas pipeline deal and other diplomatic issues in an attempt to exert a form of international blackmail against our government they want to force a negotiated settlement without the consent of the injured american steelmakers which brought the complaints if they are successful our domestic steel firms would suffer even further losses of jobs sales and would have to have longer delays in their efforts to modernize their plants further the european nations pressuring for favorable settlements want a guarantee that there will be no future filings against them of additional antidumping cases or countervailing duty that would provide them with free reign to systematically destroy our domestic steel production capabilities already basic steel employment in america stands at a depressing 49year low if current trends continue our steel producers can expect to lose 2 billion during this decade and another 100 000 american steelworkers will be without jobs as a member of the

peaceful resolution of the conflict in northern ireland the friends of ireland came together primarily out of concern over the violence prevailing in northern ireland our objective is not only to develop a close working relationship with the republic of ireland but also to inform the american public of all aspects of the conflict working toward a solution which will respect the rights and traditions of all the inhabitants of northern ireland two recent events relating to northern ireland seem to me to hold out hope for an end to the fighting the first is the result of a poll conducted by the london sunday times among the people of northern ireland which offers a revealing glimpse of the mood and aspirations of both catholics and protestants more important it suggests promising directions for future talks the sunday times poll shows that contrary to the stereotypes arising out of the endless violence the vast majority of the people of northern ireland are strongly opposed to the use of violence to achieve political ends even the tiny violentminded minority has declined radically in the past few years negotiations toward an adequate political solution would receive overwhelming popular support right now furthermore the results of the poll show that although the majority and minority have radically different views of the ideal settlement there is common ground between them two thirds of all respondents representing a crosssection of the population indicated that they would aecept a settlement based on an independent assembly with powersharing guarantees for the catholic minoritythe principle embodied in the sunningdale agreement in 1973 which was blocked at the time by extremist elements eight years of violence are a powerful argument against extremists on both sides other poll results indicate that the political polarization which led to the election of irish repuiblican army terrorists and protestant hardliners in the last election has decreased and may diminish further if moderation ii 4493 results in progress toward a settlement however continuation in the status quo may cause this conciliatory mood to evaporate especially among the catholic minority the sunday times poll notes a vast and growing gulf between the catholic community and the british government the british army originally welcomed as protectors by an embattled minority have earned the fear and dislike of most catholicsnot just the ira and its sympathizers this gulf however could narrow if the government demonstrates a willingness to make concessions to the minority point of view abandoning the narrowmindcd approach which is leading to increased tension in the province a second event may provide a chance to end the current stalemate membe~rs of the irish commission on justice and peace an agency of the catholic church in the republic have succeeded in drafting a settlement which would end the hunger strikes in the maze prison and lessen the tension between the two sides brought on in part by the propaganda victories of the ira i join many of my colleagues in congress in urging that prime minister thatcher and her government review the opportunities presented by this draft and consider the advantages of waiving their insistence on points which serve only to limit british op1 tions in pursuing an end to the violence in its approach to the conflict in northern ireland mrs thatchers government has concentrated on controlling the activities of the ira british government officials in northern ireland appear to view their role as that of the forces of law battling terrorists criminally masquerading as political dissidents in this light better policing may seem to be the key to suppressing the violence however the catholic community has been understandably uncooperative with this effort in the bloody context of irish history the catholic minority cannot see british attempts to stabilize an unsatisfactory social order as anything but continued oppression for the catholics the army brought british rule without british justice due process and protection of individual rights britains most revered legacy to america are notoriously absent from proceedings against alleged terrorists in northern ireland the right to trial by jury protections against selfincrimination the right to counselall are abridged or suspended in the socalled diplock courts set up under the prevention of terrorism act accused terrorists are tried and usually convicted by a single judge as many as 90 percent of convictions are obtained solely on the basis of confessionselicited after an average of 3 days of detention followed by months of waiting for trial in an atmosphere tainted by repeated charges of physih 4494 co cal abuse and psychological torture under the judges rules prevailing in the rest of the united kingdom or under any reasonable judicial system these confessions would be considered highly suspect in the diplock courts they result in a conviction rate of 94 percent most of those arrested and convicted under these procedures are catholic the british government dismissed bobby sands and his compatriots as common criminals perhaps they were but they were not convicted under common conditions bobby sands it is said had a string of murders and terrorist attacks on his conscience he was convicted only of being present in a car in which a gun was found for which he was sentenced to 14 years in jaila term which anywhere else in england would be considered presposterous the british goverrnent claims he was just a common thug but it has never adequately proved that to a jury of his peers let alone the world is it any wonder that men convicted under special procedures demand special treatme t mrs thatcher has refused to negotiate with the prfsoners in the maze in her words one of the most humane and liberal prison systems in the world on principle one does not negotiate with terrorists since the british government has already waived so many of the basic principles of british justice in northern ireland however one may wonder why this particular principle is of such overriding importance that it must be upheld at the cost of continuing bloodshed at any rate the british government does not object as a rule to negotiating with terrorists lord carrington the british foreign minister recently stated that he was willing to meet with noted terrorist yasir arafat in the interests of peace in the middle east inspired negotiations with rhodesian terrorists led to the birth of the nation of zimbabwe a proud achievement of british foreign policy however suppose the british instead of negotiating with mugabe and his associates had instead cordoned off the suburbs of salisbury and announced that they would defend forever the inhabitants right to remain within the british empire meanwhile allowing this little enclave to govern itself in a fashion repugnant to the principles of british democracy would they be as eager to denounce the violent response of black dissidents as terrorism terrorism cannot be condoned under any circumstances the vicious behavior of the ira and of the ulster volunteer force serves no legitimate purpose it only poisons the atmosphere and adds to the fear and suffering of the people whose rights these organizations supposedly champion as mrs thatcher has accurately pointed out these terrorist groups are engaged chiefly in deny ng others their first right the right to life random violence and brutal often misdirected retaliations have taken the lives of thousands of innocents since the fighting began in 1969 1 am proud that the efforts of prominent irishamerican politicians have succeeded in dimninishing the american base of support for ira operations and i hope that by participating in the activities of the friends of ireland i will help to diminish that support still further americans of irish descent must understand that support for the ira whether direct or channeled through organizations such as the irish northern aid society recently ordered by a federal district court to register as an agent of the ira can only inflict further suffering on tht people of northern ireland catholic as well as protestant aid to extremists will only thwart any efforts to moderate the conflict and end the violence mrs thatchers government has stated that it considers its prime responsibility in northern ireland to be protection of the lives of its citizens all other considerations are secondary this is an approach made in good faith to a tragic and seemingly intractable political impasse and it is true that the violence has abatedat least outside the detention centerssince the terrifying days when the british army first marched in to rescue the catholics of bogside from their fellow citizens however the authoritarian attitude carries with it certain risks selective protection of rights under an arbitrary system of justice amounts at best to order without law in short tyranny clearly the catholic community sees it that way the sunday times poll shows that the catholic community in belfast overwhelmingly disapproves of the british governments handling of the situation in northern ireland their profound and increasing alienation is demonstrated in the same poll by increasing despair about the prospect of peace in the future especially among the young after hundreds of years of oppression and 50 years of gerrymandering discrimination and the hostility of the ruling class the catholic minority took its cue from the american civil rights movement of the sixties and began to march for civil rights and an equitable share of power in the local government this movement was met almost immediately with violence in 1969 as in 1914 the extremists of the ruling order were the first to arm mrs thatchers government in denouncing the undeniable atrocities of the ira should keep in mind what the catholics of belfast and bogside have never forgottenthat the provisional ira was born out of catholic fear to defend the minority against the ulster police and their auxiliary thugs mrs thatcher justifies her attitude toward the ira by saying that ~ if 1 the bomb is seen to succeed then the terrorist has beaten the ballot box 0 but the catholics of northern ireland have never had much success with the ballot box people who cannot turn to statesmen for protection will inevitably turn to terrorists the ira will continue however unjustly to win the propaganda war until the british government can offer its citizens more than the unpalatable choice between repression and lawlessness in 1969 the catholic minority demanded civil rights and found itself in danger of mass violence the british government has protected their lives to a certain extent but their original aspirations civil rights and equitable representation have been all but forgotten in the drive to impose order on an unresolved conflict most catholics now identify the british army as an ally of the other side the claim that british rule weighs equally heavily on the protestant majority is hardly credible to a people who remember that the arrival of the army was followed by mass internment a barbaric action directed almost exclusively against the catholic community or who listen to the pronouncements of a government which alternates assurances to the majority that their wishes will forever be respected with denunciations of the ira as the root of all evil in the province more years of military rule in northern ireland will have anything but a stabilizing effect continuation of the present order can only result in further alienation of the catholic community perpetuate violence and increase despair it is time to stop wasting the lives of british soldiers and irish civilians trying to maintain an unworkable status quo the settlement drafted by the irish commission for justice and peace offers a ray of hope in the grim impasse between british prison authorities and ira prisoners i urge the government to seize this opportunity it is rare for the ira to show signs of moderation such concessions must be rewarded if northern irish politics are to recover from their sectarian paralysis the people of northern ireland are weary of violence most would be ready to accept a reasonable settlement concessions on both sides would improve the climate for achieving such a settlement and lighten the despairing view of the future held by most of the catholic minority this chance is too important to be thrown away for the sake of a hypocritical and inconsistent principle sidney smith a british essayist of the 19th century once observed sourly thatthe moment the very name of ireland is mentioned the gnglish seem to bid adieu to common feeling common prudence and common sense and to act with the barbarity of tyrants and the fatuity of idiots unfortunately the history of british rule in ireland bears out this bitter view the british government is no mere impartial peacekeeping force the army bias in favor of one side has become so obvious that one observer has characterized its role as that of the third combatant britain bears a heavy responsibility for the distrust and hatred prevailing in northern ireland today so far the response of the british government to the irishi commission proposal has been discouraging while british authorities remain intransigent even on symbolic concessions another hunger striker has died the terrorists of the ira in abandoning the demand for political status have shown themselves more willing to make concessions than the government which holds them prisoner casting doubt on mrs thatchers claim to flexibility and putting the government at a severe disadvantage in its efforts to discredit the ira dr garret fitzgerald the irish prime minister has pointed out that the greatest responsibility must as always rest on those with the greatest power 0 i amn encouraged by dr fitzgeralds determination to make a settlement in northern ireland the highest priority of his new government and i urge the president of the united states to join with the government of eire in calling upon the british government to act now in good faith to end the crisis before a new wave of violence ravages northern ireland the world hailed the british settlement in zimbabwe under equally difficult circumstances i hope and pray that at this crucial juncture mrs thatchers goveniment will act with equal clearsightedness and

salmon are coming back in the connecticut river we can thank the gentleman from massachusetts for going ahead with his abovebudget fights to put the salmon back into that river to restore that beauty of nature to new england or we could have stopped the reforestation programn as another example ten years ago this committee dedicated itself to making sure that for every tree cut a new one would be planted ind we put enough money in our bill above the budget may i say to establish a 10year reforestation program to replace the forests thdt are burned out by fire or that are crosscut by loggers saws to omit these funds did not make any sense to us we went over the budget in this bill to harvest the lumber to begin the harvest of the lumber that now lies on the slopes of mount st helens that was cut down when that volcano erupted we have taken steps to save that timber because we think it is only good husbandry to do that so that the timber is not destroyed by insects or by fire or by other hazards moreover that timber that is cut brings receipts into the treasury and we thought that yes there will be a day when high interest rates come dowvn and we would need lumber in the future for a revived housing industry with lower prices for timber because of the increased timber cuts that our committee had approved let me say what else we might have done we might have done to the indians what so many generations of americans had done to them for decades in the past for almost a century degrading them ignoring them and depriving them of funding to educate their children to protect their resources and to provide for their health for some strange reason for years 0mb has refused to provide funds for schools that were unsafe and for health clinics that were so decrepit as to be nonusable since i have been chairman of this subcommittee with my good friend the gentleman from pennsylvania mr josmnh mcdade the ranking minority member we have tried to meet the problems of native americans and to remedy in some measure the wrongs that have been done to them for decades and we decided against continuing those wrongs for example in this bill as we have in earlier bills we put money in the budget to take care of the indian children who were 100 percent unhoused we havc moncy here for two schools there are extra funds in this bill to built only twvo schools and there am3 many that should be built for the indian children 0mb provided no money in its budget for any indian schools i could go on and on to point out places where we went over the budget to do what we thought was good for america for the conservation programs for instance for energy for example we provide funds to make us less dependent on sheik yamani of saudi arabia and his partners in opec for our oil needs yes we are making progress in cutting down oil consumption in this country that is one reason we have an oil glut now and this committees funding in past years for the department of the intehecr has helped toward that goal but 0mb recommended relatively little funds in this budget for the conservation proram and we went over the budget to try f o keep the program built up because we can see that a barrel of oil saved is a barrel of oil that we do not have to buy 0 1315 in sum our committee could have been as slavishly devoted to thle account books as 0mb important as that is we could have done that without exercising our legislative judgment without taking account of the actual conditions within the areas of funding responsibility that this committee has but we thought other things were more important that there were higher purposes for this great beautiful country of ours than worrying about a few less dollars when it comes to making the lives of americans a little richer and yes to make their pocketbooks a little richer too for this bill pays its way this bill provides funds for the treasury over and above the overages that are here 17 billion in receipts i notice in yesterdays paper that in his press conference the president said that he would veto any budgetbusting bill the congress sent to him and i suppose he is talking about this bill among others because as i said this bill is 1 billion over the budget but i say to the president this is not a budgetbusting bill before he puts his pen to any veto i would hope he would remember that this is a moneymaking bill for the treasury 17 billion worth and capable of making more i suggest too that the president remember his visits to the beautiful forest of camp david on weekends and to his bodybuilding and soulhealing ranch in the mountains of california as he considers this bill we hope he continues those trips because we wish him well and we want him to relax from the enormous pressures and tensions of his job and to build himself up but i would hope the president would remember that camp david which he enjoys so much is in the catoctin national park and that this bill gives the people of america the same opportunity a similar opportunity to enjoy themselves in the national park too with their children to ride or to backpack in the majesty of the mountains at grand teton or the rockies or to enjoy the clear streams in our national forests or to bring their children to view the wonders of yellowstone or yosemite also in this bill we foster the tradition that was established by another president a republican president about 100 years ago to set aside and to develop the national treasures of this nation our national heritage to be enjoyed by our children and our childrens children that is what this bill does can this rich powerful and wonderful country of ours afford to pay for this bill for the peoples national heritage i think so i am sure the american people think so too that is why i asked for your support for this bill for your vote because this is a nonpartisan bill i see the gentlewoman from new jersey on the floor she and i were talking about new jersey the other day about the pinelands that are such an excellent coop erative adventure between the federal government and the states we put 6 million in this bili at the request of governor byrne of new jersey because it is such a good idea that is above the budget again mrs fenwick and i were talking about the aquifers below the surface in newv jersey and how there the possibility exists of there being despoiled as a result of what is happening in the development of the state the geological survey receives funds in this bill to protect that aquifer and every aquifer throughout

distasteful to some of us who support the notion of moterstate banking the fact of the matter is that the regulators have made a very persuasive case the most compelling point revolves around the dire circumstances faced by some financial institutions at this time particularly the savings banks in new york however it should be stressed that this bill is neither a bailout nor new york oriented through depository insurance the congress has had bailout legislatlon on the books for decades more important this bill is designed to reduce not increase federal liabilities bill isaac chairman of the fdic estimates that failure to pass this bill would mean the loss of between 2 and 3 billion more than otherwise from the fdic insurance fund the ramifications of this additional cost would be borne by the entire financial system and this would jeopardize rural state banks especially those in states like iowa and kentucky which have small book traditions further there is a general understanding that a run on any financial institution could cause panic that would affect all financial institutions this also would jeopardize the financial stability of small banks finally let me just stress that while there are going to be some amendments presented that are very philosophically appealini i would hope they would be rejected they compromise the thrust of this legislation i

the information the gentleman has used it is certainly not from our experts in fema or in defense he dismisses the soviet system with the wave of a hand and many experts feel that the soviet system is excellent that is the whole point of the debate if they do not have a system to protect their population we do not need one either no one knows what would happen if there was an allout nuclear war we cannot even predict what the economy is going to do next month i would also like to do away with all nuclear weapons too and have a nuclear freeze but that is not going to happen tomorrow if it ever happens i would like to ask the gentleman on his own time later what he would advise his family and friends if the soviets began walking out of their cities in a time of crisis and we do not have any plan at all to help our people i will ask the gentleman that on his own time the gentleman from massachusetts amendment will not provide an adequate civil defense program for america it is just going to keep us muddling along like we have been doing ever since john f kennedy left office the magic of the 252 million pro gram or appropriation is that it represents the first year of a 7year comprehensive program for civil defense president reagan is the first president since john p kennedy to propose such a program the gentlemans amendment would serve to postpone for one more year any program that would give the american people as good a plan as the soviets have one of the arguments for the amendment is that it would be viewed by the soviets as an escalation in preparedness if we spent 252 million for civil defense that is nonsense all we are doing is copying what the soviets have been doing for 10 years everyone brings up the problem of rush hour traffic in large cities and the fact that we cannot evacuate our cities their whole program is based on evacuation we can do it as well as they can we have more vehicles we have better highways so the nuclear scales stay balanced others suggest a nuclear war would be over in minutes so it is silly to have a program for civil defense my colleagues that is the least likely scenario that is not going to happen because if it does then both sides lose 150 million of their citizens another argument is that it costs too much and we connot afford it this is minuscule in cost compared to what we spend to destroy other people and other nations we are going to be spending about 300 billion a year average for the next 3 or 4 years on a defense budget that is an offensive budget actually only 3 billion of that onetenth of 1 percent over 7 years will be spent to protect the american people i do not think that is excessive at all othetsargue that our crisis relocation plans are imperfect that the cities have been rejecting our plans and the people have been rejecting the plans that the cities have devised i say no administration since john kennedy and hardly any congress since john kennedy has done anything to help improve our civil defense system we have cut it every year and i imagine the gentleman from massachusetts has joined in the cuts to civil defense every year but even at that only 1 in 100 plans has been rejected so the people that are out there working in civil defense the profeasionals have had no encouragement whatsoever from washington i feel that civil defense is completely compatible with the nuclear freeze concept i would like to do away with all nuclear weapons as i am sure everyone in this house would but realistically we know that it is not going to happen tomorrow in the meantime let us buy a little insurance let us balance the nuclear scales let us prevent nuclear war by giving the american people as good or as bad but the same civil defense system that the soviets have given their people the case for civil defense in my estimation is clear we should be as strong as our adversary if we are going to prevent war we are told by our experts that we enjoy rough equivalency in weaponry that means we have equal destructive capability but if they have a good civil defense system and i think they do and i think they think that they do which is even more important they can protect their people and we cannot protect ours and it makes a mockery of the strategic balance that must be maintained if we are going to maintain peace it gives to the soviets a huge advantage in any kind of confrontation no one knows just how superior their system is but if they just think their system is superior it gives them the came kind of an advantage we do know however if we quantify the situation that they are trying 10 times harder in civil cefense than we are where we have 10 000 fulltime people in civil defense they have over 100 000 people working fulltime in civil defense where we spend roughly 100 million on civil defense they have been spending more than 1 billion on civil defense for the last 10 years when it comes to casualties the experts i took tothe people in fema the doctors the ph d s the physics majorsthat have been studying civil defense and nuclear problems for most of their adult lives tell us that we would lose about 150
