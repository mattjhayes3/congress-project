lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached the goal of a decent safe and affordable home for every americanbut we have come a long way the nation has been transformed the remaining task can be doneand it will be"], [0.962412416934967,

today to join with my colleague from connecticut to introduce legislation establishing a trust fund to help compensate the families of the victims who were tragically killed in the lamblance plaza cpllapse in bridgeport ct in april of last year twentyeight construction workers lost their lives when the partially built 13story apartment complex toppled to the ground this catastrophe was the worst human toll from a construction accident in a decade the legislation establishes a trust fund from the record 5 1 million in fines levied by the occupational safety and health administration against the contractors and subcontractors that engaged in sloppy construction and engineering practices and wantonly disregarded worker safety if the government successfully collects the 5 1 million in fines there may be little left to compensate the victims families the purpose of our bill is to ensure that the victims claims come first once the civil suits have been settled the remaining monies in the trust fund if any will be paid to the secretary of labor to be deposited into the treasury the fund will be administered by the unitedstates district court the government must share in the responsibility for the tragedy after listening to extensive testimony at five congressional hearings it is clear osha has failed to properly carry out its mandate to protect workers health and safety in several important areas of responsibility today i would like to share my impressions of osha and the way it has handled events surrounding the lambiance plaza collapse first it is imperative that osha review and change its reporting requirements current osha regulations stipulate that a construction accident must be reported only when a fatality or five or more hospitalizations occur i find it incomprehensible that an accident of the magnitude of lambiance would have gone unreported if fewer than five people were hospitalized or no life was lost oshas investigation into the lambiance collapse revealed a near disaster involving the same liftslab contractor at the metro center construction site in stamford ct 1 year earlier this accident should have served as a warning of impending tragedy but it was never reported because osha had no requirement that it be reported the metro center accident occurred when a shearhead failure caused part of a concrete floor to sag some 15 inches in an accident nearly identical to the lambiance incident not only was the same contractor involved in both accidents but the same faulty building techniques and practices were responsible osha officials expressed astonishment that more devastating damage did not take place at the mero center site it is clear an accident of this severity warranted a thorough investigation even though no lives were lost and only one worker wav injured had osha officials been notified of what happened at metro center they could have taken steps to prevent the tragedy at lambiance second from the testimony i heard from representatives of labor and the construction industry it is obvious that osha is severely understaffed and underfunded in the state of connecticut there are ten osha inspectors however of those 10 only 2 specialize in construction given the inherent hazards in the construction industry i find this statistic unacceptable regrettably osha officials testified before the health and safety subcommittee that they have all the resources they need third besides requiring more resources osha may need to reorganize itself at the very least a separate division should be established within osha solely to monitor and regulate the construction industry given the unique dangers of this industry it may even be advisable to create an ent ely new agency under the department of labor finally the assessment of high financial penalties such as the record 5 1 million in the lambiance plaza disaster cries out for criminal sanctions as well employers who knowingly violate safety codes should be held accountable for their actions for too long individuals within a corporation have been allowed to hide behind their corporate shield the company is fined the major decision makers within the company walk away scotfree it seems so obvious to me that an employer who knowingly disregards safety regulations resulting in the serious injury or death of an employee should be subject to criminal prosecution murder in the workplace cannot be tolerated recently osha referred the lambiance case to the department of justice for criminal prosecution the justice department must now decide whether to prosecute twentyeight workers lost their lives fines were imposed and yet no one has been prosecuted but even if individuals are prosecuted under current law the penalties can only be a maximum of 10 000 and 6 months in jail according to testimony before the employment and housing subcommittee osha has referred only 38 cases since its inception in 1970 for criminal prosecution of those 38 cases the justice department has pursued 14 this record is pathetic it is my understanding no one has spent 1 day in jail for violating federal osha law because of this dismal record states such as new york illinois and california have had the take the initiative in cases where osha has imposed a minimal monetary fine for a serious violation of safety codes state prosecutors have successfully pursued homicide convictions regrettably state prosecutors have recently pursued cases and won criminal convictions only to have them challenged on the grounds that feder al law preempts state law osha should immediately clarify the right of state prosecutors to impose criminal sanctions against employers who knowingly and recklessly disregard worker safety if necessary it should recommend to congress that the law be amended to make absolutely clear that the federal statute does not preempt the states in addition we must have a tougher and more aggressive federal statute the penalties are simply not strong enough it has been more than a year since the lamblance collapse tragically we have seen little movement to change any of the factors that contributed to the accident osha has not reviewed or modified its reporting requirements osha is undermanned and underfunded yet it has not requested additional resources osha has made no effort to establish a separate divislon to oversee construction in spite oi the unique dangers of the industry osha refuses to recommend any legislative or regulatory charges imposing tougher criminal sanctions or addressing the preemption issue twentyeight people lost their lives the victims families must not only live with the loss of their loved ones but also with the reality that their government has not responded to their tragedy the legislation we introduced yesterday will not correct the shortcomings of osha but it will ensure that the victims families be afforded every opportunity for a just and fair financial settlement

commission these programs are very important to the future of the unitedstates flag merchant marine in that they continue federal support of a unitedstates owned fleet manned by unitedstates citizens and assure that ocean transportation services are fair and equitable this bill is the product of careful consideration by the committee on merchant marine and fisheries and has the bipartisan support of committee members h r 953 authorizes 391 297 million 60 million more than the administration requested but about 11 million less than 1987 h r 953 reflects the administrations request for 14 5 million for the federal maritime commission in this year when trade legislation is in the forefront the congress must be especially mindful of the important work carried out by the fmc this authorization provides the commission with the necessary funds to discharge its statutory mandate the fmc must have the resources now and in the future to assure that ocean transportation is conducted in a fair and open environment h r 953 represents the administrations request for the maritime administration except in two areas the administration requested repeal of title xi of the merchant marine act 1936 the federal ship financing fund while not going as far as the administration might wish h r 953 does eliminate all offshore oil equipment and vessels and all inland tugs and barges from coverage under the loan guarantee program for a period of at least 3 years this change returns the title xi program to its original purpose and sends a signal to the executive branch that congress is addressing the programs problems the administration also requested that certain training programs of the six state madtime academies be phased out in 1988 h r 953 however continues assistance to these state academies in the amount of 10 million in light of a recent navy merchant marine manpower study predicting manning shortfalls it would be unwise to terminate such token federal funding when the programs assure trained mariners for the future sealift contingencies h r 953 also authorizes 300 million for funding of the operatingdifferential subsidy program under title vi of the merchant marine act 1936 49 7 million of this amount is included to cover future needs if reform legislation is enacted this year if the unitedstates flag merchant fleet is to be maintained at even the current levels a change is necessary to encourage vessels to remain under the unitedstates flag the recent events in the persian gulf indicate the importance of sea power to the security of this nation sea power however is not only calculated in terms of warships sea power must also be defined by the ability to support and supply our forces anywhere in the world and assure an uninterrupted flow of raw materials and goods to our shores this is the historical role of the merchant marine and it is in the national interest that the united states have a vital merchant marine under its own flag the programs provided for by h r 953 are important for the future of our americanflag merchant marine and to the security of this nation i urge my colleagues to support h r 953"], [0.0006974935531616211,
