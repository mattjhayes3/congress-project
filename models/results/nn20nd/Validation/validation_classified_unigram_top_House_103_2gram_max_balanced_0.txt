clinton through his false gimmick packaging is trying to sell the american people into believing that his huge tax hike the largest in american history will go towards reducing the federal deficit president clinton and the democrats are conning the american people and this is why i checked with my doctors yesterday to get their approval to cast my vote against president clintons budget this vote is the first i have made since i underwent triple bypass surgery on july 16 to remove arterial blockage i believe this vote is crucial to my constituents and the country and this is why i am here before you instead of at home recuperating the democratic leadership claim that the goal of the clintons tax package is to pare 500 billion from the federal debt over the next 5 years what president clinton and the democrats fall to say is that even if they pass the presidents budget the nations debt will still increase by a staggering 1 2 tillion if this doublespeak is not insulting enough to the intelligence of taxpayers clinton and the democrats are trying to pull a fast one on american families and businesses by frontloading 275 billion of gross tax increases without significant spending cuts the clinton tax package heaps taxes on americans already struggling to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their families rather than making americans pay their fair share the clinton tax plan will ensure that americans will be sharing most of their income with the federal government maybe the president and the democratic leadership in congress have convinced themselves of this but my constituents are not persuaded history has demonstrated to us time and time again that increasing taxes does not reduce the deficit higher taxes means increased spending i ask you my colleagues the question my constituents have asked me how can these tax increases be justified with the knowledge that no mechanisms exist to cut spending in the budget three parts of this budget represent a particularly onerous tax burden that will affect the middle class seniors and anyone else in america who breathes the gas tax the social security tax and surprising new retroactive taxes first the gas tax this federal gasoline tax of 4 3 cents per gallon will be more burdensome to families living in the large states of the west and south california will not escape the affect of this tax this increase will tax gasoline diesel compressed natural gas and noncommercial aviation fuel california will be hit extremely hard since it has a large population that utilizes various forms of transportation transportation costs will inevitably increase the clinton energy tax is inflationary and will escalate the already spiralling tax burden passed on to american families the energy tax will stifle the economic recovery we see occurring right now according to the tax foundation it is estimated that 54 299 jobs will be lost in my state of california behind every number there is a human face a family someone who can blame their unemployment on clintons tax package next the tax on social security benefits or if you listen to the president a spending cut seniors will be penalized for working and saving for their retirement under the clinton tax plan even though in his manifest putting people first candidate clinton promised to protect the integrity of the social security trust fund he hag decided to balance the budget on backs of senors cintons proposal will affect seniors with incomes of over 32 000 or coups incomes over 44 000 by inrea the tax on 85 percent of their social secuty benefits in addition to this these taxes increase the elderly surtax on pensions ira withdrawals interest from municipal bonds and certifcates of deposit the tax revenues generated by these new taxes on seniors will then be used to fund other programs rather than going into the socal security trust fund the president should not wonder as he pillages senlors benefits to pay for other programs why in addition to te budget deficit he also must contend with the trust fund this elderly surtax is anything but fair the increase in the elderly surtax hits the prudent and frugel who live on ixed incomes accordlng to the heritage foundation it is estimated that in calilomia 566 328 households over 65 with incomes greater than 3 000 will be hit and more spedlically in my district 13 884 households affected the 29 billion clinton hope to rsm at the expense of our seniors could easily be achieved by implementing just a handful of seniors wastecuting recommendations that have been put before him seniors should be appalled that a president who was not even born while many of them were fighting in world wars to make the world safe for democracy and wordng to feed their

how i can help the president by sending money to the democrat congressional committee and also by sending back their survey but i was fascinated by some of what was in this letter it was addressed to me i mean it says dear robert s walker and then it says to me you are one of a select group of democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for example there is an underlying paragraph here that says unfortunately newt gingrich and his rightwing allies succeeded in cutting our congressional majority in last years election and all i could say was yippee and so that was the right thing i also kind of had the feeling at that point that i ought to start flapping my right wing but the fact is that they are admitting here that the gentleman from georgia has in fact gotten his message across to the american people and that we are in fact beginning to win new majorities but then it goes on and it tells the american people a couple of fascinating things it says here because the success or failure of the clinton administration depends upon which party has control of the congress righto i say to my colleagues if you wanted to have the clinton administration succeed what tom foley is telling you in this letter is you want democrats in the congress if you dont want the clinton administration to succeed with higher taxes and more spending you want to change the congress the gentleman from washington is absolutely right and i am pleased

house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size

unitedstates military intervention in somalia in december 1992 through the subsequent united nations operaxion called unosom a total of 36 unitedstates servicemen were killed in somalia now at the end of our involvement in this mission when we remember and honor the service of our soldiers especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty we should also remember and take heed of the fact that over 60 peacekeepers from other countries have lost their lives in somalia as well of the u n peacekeeping force still in somalia 5 000 are from the army of india on august 22 seven indian soldiers were killed in defending a logistics convoy of the unitedstates company brown root when it was ambushed by a band of armed somalis as we honor the dedication and sacrifice of our own soldiers i believe we must do the same for those such as these indian soldiers who have served and sacrificed along side our own forces this is especially important to keep in mind for on this dayjust 2 days after the lost of our troops have left somalia5 000 unitedstates troops are being deployed in haiti in yet another mission again as in somalia the initial massive unitedstates military intervention will be followed by a much longer presence of international forces under the united nations in terms of the deployment of unitedstates military forces abroad i am deeply disturbed that successive presidents have gone to the united nations for authority to use military force internationally rather than to the unitedstates congress as the president is required to do under the constitution president bush did this in iran and somalia then president clinton rubberstamped the actions in somalia and now has pursued the same course in haiti and looked favorably upon both the invasions by president reagan of grenada and then the what i consider to be n infamous invasion on our part of panama with the results that the avowed purposes we had for invading panama has resulted in us having to keep right now twothirds of the number of our troops that we had at the height of the invasion of panama if we do not it will not be an american life safe in panama we went in ostensibly to capture what we said was the chief drug peddler and try to put a stop w the extensive dope and drug peddling as a natte of fact since our invasion the amount of narcotics illegal through panama and by panama and from panama is three limes more than it was at the time of our invasion so these are things that ought to sober us at this point this shakes our constitutional system of government to its coore but this also has a concrete impact on the lives of soldiers from around the world this new world order seems to be one in which the united states leads the charge to intervene militarily and then international forces are left to carry out the longer peacekeeping functions as we pay our respects to the service and sacrifices of those in our armed forces i believe we must

offering a fiscally prudent amendment that i believe deserves broad support earlier this year at the budget committee i worked very closely with the cosponsor of the amendment mr shays together we drafted the republican alternative amendment to the budget resolution on the international affairs portion of the budget that budget amendment included the provision now being jointly offered on a bipartisan basis by mr kanjorski and mr shays the purpose of the national endowment for democracy is certainly laudable although ned is often thought of as the main entity working to promote democratic development around the world there are in fact many different unitedstates government programs and funding mechanisms working in this field these range from aid judicial reform programs to unitedstates broadcasting services such as voa and radio free europe virtually all aspects of programs run by the unitedstates information agency in some way address the issue of democratic development as well moreover ned has a long history of poor budgetary and administrative practices in 1986 the gao issued a harshly critical report which ned promised to address then in 1991 the gao issued a followup report which found that ned had taken no real action to improve its budget and program oversight procedures faced with possible defunding 2 years ago ned did adopt a plan to respond to the gaos criticism a year ago the gao reported that if ned this time actually followed through the plan had the potential of improving its financial operations this episode points to an increasing concern i have had with ned over the past few years while i have no objection with the endowments stated purpose i believe that an annual legislative earmark for federal funding of this private institution has actually harmed neds effectiveness frankly i believe that this earmark has not only reduced the incentive for ned to conduct rigorous evaluation of its own programs and their effectiveness it has also led to a low level of agency oversight and direction compared to programs directly administered by the unitedstates government i have also been concerned by the continued rapid growth of federal funding for this private organization from fiscal year 1990 to fiscal year 1993 spending on ned doubled to the current funding level of 30 million this bill proposed to increase neds funding by another 60 percent to 48 million this is the single largest percentage increase contained in the entire bill i think we should be clear on what this amendment does not do it does not terminate the national endowment for democracy despite the word national in its name ned is a private organization while most of neds funding come from the unitedstates taxpayers the endowment and its fourcore grantees do raise private funds for their work certainly they could and should do more also it is still possible under this amendment for ned to receive federal funding all this amendment does is eliminate the 48million earmark for ned contained in this bill the endowment could still compete with other organizations for specific grants through usia or aid removing the earmark removes neds sense of an everexpanding entitlement to unitedstates taxpayer funds having to compete on a level playing field for federal funding will force ned to justify every proposed project this will not only vastly improve oversight over the endowments activities but will help ensure that all such activities are fully compatible with unitedstates foreign policy goals so again i would like to acknowledge this amendments fiscal responsibility with its passage it will further reduce this bills authorization below the fiscal year 1993 appropriated level i urge adoption of the

that this country has for that technology for not only todaybut the years ahead and i appreciate the discourse and gladly yield any time that she would like to so discuss it again in the future tonight is the beginning of a conversation a dialog that i would like to have with my colleagues i sense the need for a national dialog about the values which hold communities together and underlie and support the legislative efforts of those of us who are honored to be public servants in our nations capitol i hope that through this discussion we might begin to change the tenor of public debate from the adversarial and disrespectful discourse that is sometimes observed to a more cooperative and respectful interaction that focuses on solutions instead of dwelling on the points where we disagree many of the values and principals needed for a strong community and society are familiar to us all some of them may even seem trite however after 3 short years in congress it has become clear to me that they have not been focused on nearly enough we especially have not heard enough of what mainstreet america believes and wants for our country it is for this reason that i and a number of my colleagues have committed ourselves to spending some time every wednesday night talking about the issues and challenges facing this country in the hope that we can begin to rebuild bridges of trust between the public and government and between different groups around the country too much of the public discourse these days is divisive destructive and negative it is time to develop a new language that begins to reconnect a society that today appears to be more divided than it was during the civil war if we are unable to successfully reconstruct a sense of community in america we may yet realize the tragic prophecy of one of our greatest leaders abraham linooln who in 1838 a full score before the civil war uttered these words a the armles of europe asia and africa combined with all the treasure of the earthour own exceptedin their military chest with a bonaparte for a commander could not by force take a drink from the ohio or make a track on the blue ridge in a trial of a thousand years if destruction be our lot we must overselves be its author and finisher as a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide he was of course speaking of the impending evil of civil wax but what was spoken over 150 years ago could very easily apply to today only today it is a subtler more insidious virus that pits group against group special interest against special interest ideology against ideology the streets of los angeles during the riots the daily drug killings in our towns and throwaway kid syndrome exhibited by too many parents demonstrates that societal suicide is alive and well in america it seems as if here in congress opposition is tantamount to cooperation little attention is given to the greater good of the whole as special interests fight for their programs and policy our national interests are pitted against the selfish interests of individuals and groups it is a winlose situation where all too often it the nation as a whole and the majority of its citizens who are on the losing side surely there must be a new way a way in which we all win something where compromise and agreement can be found so that the basic values of our society can be maintained and strengthened and this will only be possible if we stop fighting about our differences and start building upon our shared values and similarities in a successful community the unspoken need is to build coalitions and consensus not factions and dysfunctional debate these communities are not successful because there are no differences it is just that the members of the community work hard to solve their problems yet the most prominent product of congressional floor debate seems to be dysfunctional gridlock what if the tone the demeanor the very language of debate in washington were changed i am not advocating the elimination of disagreement or debate rather i am calling for the elevation of more fundamental qualities that can not be legislatedthat would encourage rather than discourage resolution of differences encountered in the legislative process is it a crime to seek winwin solutions in architecture buildings are designed not only as esthetic sculptures but as functional structures that serve their inhabitants thekey is to combine the two in such a way as to provide for both the pragmatic and inspirational needs of the occupiers the debate and discussion in this process reflect mutual respect and most importantly a desire by all the parties to find agreement this is really the approach that is built upon a winwin scenario take the design of a simple house the client is not one person but the entire family each person has preferences that are different from the others the different preferences by human nature inflate or deflate certain aspects of the house in the eye of the individual those who like to cook want large kitchens party people want big living rooms and so on the architects role is to bring balance to the process and accord each living area its proper due while keeping the entire project under budget on schedule and up to the esthetic standards set by the architect and client together public buildings go through the same process although in a somewhat less personal and individualistic way public space is a place where the sense of community is heightened and relationships are promoted between members of the public neutral corners are offered where specific tasks are carried out or thoughts are gathered the balance between the two should make the role each space plays all the more effective as an architect i like to look not only at the surface and shape of buildings but at underlying structures too every building consists of beams headers and multiple other components that are concealed yet play the more important role of supporting the structure as a legislator i cannot help but see the same process of design underlying structures in society except that they are intangible concepts or values that connect individuals to their community values like neighbor helping neighbor that all of us are entitled to equal opportunity and freedoms that each of must take responsibility for our actions and for keeping our nation strong that structure is weakening what can be done to strengthen the structure the lack of a productive dialog of winwin situations has allowed legislation to focus unduly on the problems rather than on finding meaningful solutions too often we are caught up in the debate for the sake of debate not for the good it produces meanwhile our society is struggling and crumbling around the edges we cannot allow our communities to disintegrate where one group is separated from another where neighbors no longer know their neighbor when families are ripped apart we are turning our public spacesthe markets town greens and gathering places from places where relationships are created and nurtured between members of the community to sites of butchery where lives are mercilessly slaughtered so too are the relationships between these people obliterated and annihilated beyond this destruction is the destruction of all relationships that touched the lost lives their ability to love is impaired their ability to hope is hobbled in short the underlying structure of any good and tolerant society is shaken and weakened in order to encourage my colleagues and the public at large to participate in this new democratic communitywith a small di think it is only appropriate to first lay what i call the foundations of agreement these are the basic values that i think mainstreet america would say are necessary to establish a constructive discussion we have obviously lost our understanding of the foundation otherwise why would our society have splintered into multiple and divided groups there are some basic principles that need to be agreed upon just as when i hold town meetings on health care reform where the first question i ask is who thinks health care needs reforming and invariably 70 percent of the people attending raise their hands so too do we need to ask what are the basic principles that need to be agreed upon in order to start a constructive society strengthening dialog in the political arena if we can get a 70 percent agreement in this area like i can get on the need for health care reform then we have come a long way toward starting the dialogue on a positive footing let me offer some ideas i have regarding foundational principles first our society is based on a profound respect for the individual and the sacredness of the human being second that good government serves the greater good by balancing the needs of the few with the needs of the many through pragmatic reasonable decisionmaking and consensus third in a free society as individual freedoms increase so do individual responsibilities fourth the governments role is to provide the policy tools to increase individual freedom prosperity and common valuessuch as the need for strong families and that elected officials are the public servant who fulfills the will of the public for the public good i do not think either the extreme left or the extreme right can truly claim these principles a whole new paradigm or way of thinking needs to be encouraged in government so that solutions become the norm instead of rhetoric it is important for elected officials to talk but not for the sake of talking the electorate must take more responsibility by demanding that rhetoric becomes reality the record of accomplishment should be easily correlated and matched with the original plans laid out by the elected official promises made should be promises kept actions should speak louder than words what role does government have in the connecting of principles to the issues here is an example government is neither the ultimate provider of entitlement nor the blind standby agent of benign neglect another example might be government is poised in principle at the center point of the dynamic polar forces one which wishes government to do everything and the other which wishes government to do nothing both of these forces are simplistic both provide false choices both are ultimately harmful to society locked together as they are today both forces are responsible for gridlock and misery i hear too often from people about how they wish government would stop looking for partisan positions and start implementing solutions government should not define its purpose by reacting to the polarized simplistic ideological forces but rather by ignoring them and returning to the basic principles upon which hopefully we have all agreed first what is the real situation and problem second what pragmatic effective tools can be created to deal with the situation and or equip people to solve these problems what can we look for in a leader to give us confidence that he or she is thinking in this fashion there has to be balance partnerships between the public and private sector at the national and local level ought to be a common goal a balanced program creates a winwin situation for america an unbalanced program creates winners and losers which is what we have too much of today in america effective and productive activity denotes the new leader americans seek results not rhetoric and those results are being sought in health care reform crime prevention welfare reform job creation and so on we must elect and follow people who are clearly identifying goals and achieving them vice president gores reinventing government is a good example of goal setting and we hope accomplishment those not supporting this approach are willing to waste national resources to maintain ineffective or nonproductive means because they have severed the relationship between ends and means look for leaders who are interested in results produced by individuals who are freely empowered to solve problems with useful tools not necessarily tied to one party or another if every problem is seen as a nail then every solution begins to look like a hammer that kind of rigid thinking stifles creativity and narrows options for not only finding solutions but for articulating the results to different groups as well too many politicians are more interested in the idea the ideals and the end goals and maintaining a commitment to them than they are in producing pragmatic tools for solving problems they damage their own stated cause by being rigid and ideological this country is a country of optimists our problems are temporal and specific americans embody the values which with useful tools can be used freely by them to solve their problems if only government and its leaders will put enough faith in the public to do so it is an illusion to claim that government actually manages the economy what is more accurate would be to understand that government creates tools or obstacles which when freely used by individuals produces constructive progressive results or economic disaster finally i believe the independence of the american people should not be underestimated if they have the tools to solve their problems they will do so independently and without the need of interference if it aint broke dont fix it the saying goes a logical corollary would be if it is broken make the tools available for someone to fix it and they will i think these values are held by a broader crosssection of the american public than any other approach recognizing these values and allowing them to be developed and realized is the first step toward building the bridge of trust building bridges of trust are the first structures necessary for the reconstructing of the sense of community in this nation the dialog in the country is moving in this direction just witness the number of articles and books being written about the need to build community first dan kemmiscommunity and the politics of place second amatai etzionithe spirit of community third john w gardneron leadership and fourth michael rowan on the deterioration of political dialogue in the united states to name a few in congress there is evidence of this new spirit of cooperation look at the example of the pennykasich amendment this was an amendment to cut spending in government by an additional 90 billion above and beyond the cuts proposed by president clinton this amendment was crafted by a unique bipartisan group of 15 democratsi was one of themand 15 republicans could it be that we had a winwin situation with such bipartisan support unfortunately this reasonable and fair proposal lost in the waning hours of the session by the close vote of 219 to 213 although the measure failed it played an important role in solidifying an emerging coalition on the democratic side of the aisle that has become known as the new democratsa group that is determined to get results to build individu al responsibility into government policy and who are working to see that americans have the tools they need to keep this country great many people who supported the pennykasich legislation reflect the mood of a national electorate that is increasingly skeptical of washington and hungry for change it is a safe bet that this budget coalition will resurface in the future and may even hold the balance of power in the house in the coming years these were not members of congress who wanted to cut every category of spending simply for the sake of reducing the deficit however they do understand that longterm economic growth requires less government borrowing and more private investment this was the first precursor tb the ideas presented by robert shapiro in his article on cutting and investing which appeared in the wall street journal on january 17 1994 it is time to seriously reexamine the progovernment or antigovernment extreme ideologies which an increasingly skeptical middle class does not seem to be buying it is time for members of congress to start addressing the real problems that have all but destroyed the publics faith ih government homelessness broken families drugs and irresponsible citizens belong to neither party or a particular ideology they are problems all of us share and must resolve another bipartisan effort to rebuild the bridge of trust between the public and the government is a piece of legislation coauthored by congressman cmus shays a republican from connecticut and myself a democrat from new hampshire it is called the congressional accountability act it sounds simple enough congress should live by the same laws it sets for the rest of the country but as amazing as it may seem congress is partially or wholly exempt from a host of laws the executive branch and private sector must comply with including health and safety standards information disclosure equal employment opportunity and civil rights protections labor laws ethics standards and even part of social security regulations this is an outrage and is wrong more practically speaking congress would write more effective and responsible legislation if it lived under the same laws it imposes on the executive branch and private sector by exempting themselves from some laws members of congress lose the opportunity to experience firsthand the effects of the legislation they adopt and in turn they remove themselves one step further from the average american insulating themselves from the frustrations constituents face every day it is no wonder so many feel congress is out of touch being in touch is what representative government should be all about being in touch is certainly what good community is all about people in touch with themselves people in touch with each other all of us working together on common agreements to improve our society through debate on the details that is what will keep us from committing suicide that is only possible by broadening the language of political debate to include the rhetoric of responsibility and values president clinton understands this language a growing number of my col leagues also understand this language as president clinton said in his state of the union address let us be honest we all know something else too our problems go way beyond the reach of government they are rooted in the loss of values in the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families and communities my fellow americans we can cut the deficit create jobs promote democracy around the world pass the toughest crime bill in history and still leave too many of our people behind the american people have to want to change from within if we are going to bring back work and family and community we cannot renew our country when within a decade more than half of our children will be born into families where there has been no marriage we cannot renew this country when 13yearold boys get semiautomatic weapons to shoot 9yearolds for kicks we cannot renew our dountry when children are having children and the fathers walk away as if the kids do not amount to anything we cannot renew our country unless all of us are willing to join the churches and other good citizens who are saving kids adopting schools making streets safer all of us can do that we cannot renew our country until we realize that governments do not raise children parents do parents who know their childrens teachers and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong those kinds of parents can make all of the difference these are powerful words the problem at the moment is that they are only words rhetoric in the coming weeks i hope that i my colleagues who choose to participate and americans from mainstreet america can explore more deeply the values that will surely shore up the sagging foundations of our society health care reform welfare reform crime legislation and next week we will be talking about congressional reform these are all the issues that need to be focused on i think that need to be passed this year so that we can begin to improve the relationship between government and the people we need to offer examples where the rhetoric has truly been replaced by reality we need to lay out the modest plan by which we humbly hope to build a new democratic community one in which there is shared responsibility shared accountability shared pain and sorrow shared love and shared joy i look forward to

border crossings if they have any into consideration when developing state transportation plans a recent study of unitedstates border infrastructure by the unitedstates department of transportation that was mandated by istea in 1991 the assessment of border crossings and transportation corridors for north american trade recognizes that border crossing communities face special problems created by border crossing traffic including increased traffic hazards backups and pollution more importantly the study acknowledges for the first time that border states have not adequately addressed these special problems with the implementation of nafta these problems will only increase h r 4385 with my amendment requires border states to take international border crossings into account in their state

this evening to the statement of the president of the united states of just a few hours ago regarding the mostfavorednation status for china i as many americans across the nation and many members of this body just learned of this decision just a few hours ago i have not read the presidents statement i have not studied the text of his thinking with regard to this decision but i believe that it does warrant a response from those of us who have deep concerns about our relationship with china in light of extensive human rights violations i believe it is important for we in congress and we as americans to ask ourselves some fundamental questions about who we are as a nation what we stand for what is the foundation of this country what should be the foundation of our foreign policy and what is it that we mean by human rights indeed do we as americans believe what we say and do we stand by what we say with respect tohuman rights i believe respect for human rights human dignity is a fundamental value that we as americans share o 1930 it is something that is extremely important to all of us regardless of our political persuasions regardless of where we come from in this great country i truly believe that deep down inside of us we have a very deep and firm commitment to the rights and the dignity of human beings in our country and outside of our country there is a thing called mostfavorednation status and it is what it suggests a declaration that certain nations on this planet are most favored in the eyes of the united states and in the eyes of americans and so it is when we look at the human rights abuses at the hands of the chinese of the repression at the hands of the chinese when we look at the evidence of torture of imprisonment of people for standing up and expressing their political views it becomes of great concern to all of us as americans because it violates that fundamental principle and value that we share so it has been that the question of whether or not we declare a nation such as china with the record that china has on abuse of its citizens and others clear violations of human rights whether we should extend mostfavorednation status to such a country whether we should declare a nation that engages so systematically in violations of human rights a most favored nation last year the president of the united states declared that if china was to have mostfavorednation status extended in 1994 that it had to make overall significant progress in the areas of human rights what has happened in that years time i know of no one who can say with a straight face that china has made overall significant progress toward human rights in this past year no one who i know who is familiar with the situation in that nation and no one i know who is familiar with the situation in tibet would suggest that overall significant progress has been made with respect to human rights by the chinese asia watch provided testimony to this country and to this congress that last year as a matter of fact was the worst for political arrests and trials they cited evidence upon evidence upon evidence of repression in every province in china and then they turned their attention to tibet the people who are seeking dignity and respect seeking the basic fundamental right to live as tibetans to practice freely their religion and their culture to not be the objects of systematic torture and repression by the chinese and we find there are now more prisoners in tibet than in every province in china combined and we find strong evidence of a systematic attempt by the chinese to repress if not annihilate the religious traditions and culture of the tibetans so in light of all of this evidence in light of all of this testimony in light of the hearings that we have held here in congress in light of evidence and testimony that experts have brought to us of the systematic repression at the hands of the chinese the clear evidence that the chinese have failed to meet the condition that we asa nation established for extension of its most favored nation status the question for us becomes what are we to do well the president of the united states today has announced that despite these facts and this evidence he believes that we should in fact extend most favored nation status to china that we should through that policy declare that this nation is a most favored nation of the united states i was pleased to learn just a short time ago that the senate majority leader of the other body senator george mitchell indicated that he disagrees with the presidents decision he made a statement just a short time ago in which he said that the experience of recent years has been that each concession to the chinese communist regime encourages its intransigence and he went on to say i believe this will be the unfortunate result of this decision it will confirm for the chinese communist regime the success of its policy of repression on human rights and manipulation on trade ladies and gentlemen i believe very strongly that two things need to happen no 1 this congress needs to engage in a debate over whether or not we should declare china a most favored natidn of this country i believe that if we have a fair and honest and thoroughdebate this congress will respond if it hears from the people of this country as members of congress go back to their districts when they hear from the people of this country about our belief if human rights and the principles and values that we hold dear that they will come back to this body and we will have a debate and we will recognize that human rights means something and most favored nation status should mean something as well and that we should not stand idly by and declare china a most favored nation but there is something else that i think that we as americans need to do in light of todays announcement by the president i think we all have to ask ourselves who are we as a people what do we stand for what should be the foundation of americas foreign policy when we tell the world that we believe in human rights do we really mean it when we declare to the world that our foreign policy decisions are going to be based upon the recognition that human rights should be respected everywhere in the world do we really mean it what happens ladies and gentlemen when the united states says one thing and does another when we stand up and declare our support for human rights our support and respect for his holiness the dalai lama in tibet for the people of tibet and then declare china a mostfavorednation status what does it all mean what does our rhetoric mean what do we really stand for what in fact drives american foreign policy is it human rights is it respect for individuals is it the values that we cherish or is the bottom line the bottom line pure economics pure trade pure opportunities for profits ladies and gentlemen we are embarked on a very new and important era in world history the cold war is over the old ways of defining our planet and aligning our nation have changed we are engaged in a new challenge and a new opportunity we have to

as the chairman of the full committee the gentleman from wisconsin did to acknowledge the efforts of negotiating this bill that certainly the subcommittee chairman made the ranking member the gentleman from wisconsin and the senior senator from west virginia what this bill did i think was to focus a lot of attention and perhaps we are going to visit it again but i think we have to look when there are certain allegations made about the inequity of one state in an account that account was for 352 million it was one part of a 36 5 billion bill of which 13 7 billion alone went to highways so the proportion begins to decline greatly i think that this discussion has also been helpful though because it has caused us to recognize the different needs that each of us has west virginia lives and breathes on highways if you turn to other parts of the bill for instance we have some airports getting earmarked which i support some airports getting earmarks which exceeded what west virginia gets for airport money we have no mass transit systems we can spend a lot of time looking for mass transit systems in west virginia but they are called coal shuttle cars we have no mass transit system in west virginia the issue of controversy on corridor h coming out of the conference 90 million is what it costs 1 mile of metro so i just ask that everyone look i think this does reflect a fair agreement i am encouraged for this reason first of all the 35 million for the most troublesome section of corridor h can be built i think that is very important the second thing is this committee for which i appreciate the efforts of all involved recognizes the importance of corridor h as a truly national highway i understand it has funding needs and is ready to go in the words of the committee i believe will proceed expeditiously on it i think for all of us it is a plus i hope what this debate has done is begin to cause each of us to recognize the needs which each one of us has and that you may not get what you want in one account but you are probably getting help and assistance in another account in the context of this broad bill i believe this committee has addressed many many needs"], [0.000276029109954834, 0.5002760291099548, 1, "these days we hear a lot of talk about cutting spending well what about the proposed trade agreement with mexico how much will it cost unitedstates taxpayers in actual dollars i say to my colleagues hold on to your wallets because nafta is out to suck them dry how much will nafta cost forty billion dollars just to start off with that is for the cost of paying for american workers who will be thrown out of their jobs the cost of building roads and sewers south of the border more customs inspectors loss of tariff revenues to our government and price supports related to farmers in our country who are going to lose income that sound incredible but that is what it says right here in yesterdays new york times based on administration and congressional budget office figures let me put this incredible 40 billion in perspective compare it to the flood relief we are going to have to give to iowa we expect the president to come in here and ask for s21 billion what a waste it would be to pass this treaty and send our workers jobs to mexico what a waste and what an incredible waste to spend 40 billion to do it this

originally offered by representatives ackerman and leach seeks to support democracy and human rights in burma this resolution expresses the sense of the house that the military authorities in burma should hand over the reins of government to those who in 1990 were elected to govern it restates our admiration and support for the imprisoned prodemocracy activist and nobel laureate aung san suu kyi it calls on the unitedstates government to elevate democracy and human rights in burma in our diplomatic dialog it urges greater international pressure on the military regime in rangoon and it sends a forceful message that we are not prepared to deal with the regime in burma on the basis of business as usual as many of my colleagues know burma has been governed since 1988 by one of the worlds truly odious regimes known as the slorc in 1990 in a monumental miscalculation the slorc permitted the holding of free elections to the regimes surprise and consternation the burmese people gave their overwhelming support not to the junta but to the national league for democracy whose leader aung san suu kyi languished under house arrest the tegime responded not by relinquishing power but by simply ignoring the election results and stepping up its repression last week marked the fifth anniversary of aung san suu kyis imprisonment i can think of no more fitting way to express our support for this courageous woman than by adopting this resolution house resolution 471 is supported by the administration and has widespread backing on both sides of the aisle in this body so it is with great

in and say that our standards our food safety standards the ones that you all have passed over the last several years to protect the consumer the ones who will be eating this food but what was
