the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it

oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut

the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal

percent while the rates for african americans and hispanics remain unacceptably high at 27 6 percent and 25 3 percent respectively in 2005 i founded the congressional out of poverty caucus because of the rising tide of poverty some of us saw this unfortunate day coming that was beginning under the failed policies of the previous administration of course we also know the terrible economic impact of the massive financial crisis that they left us on their way out of office with the swift efforts of president obama and congressional democrats we are finally beginning to dig ourselves out of the hole that was left by the bush administration and slowly moving the poverty rate in the right direction we must do more and we can do more one of the most critical responsibilities we have as a government is to promote and enact policies that keep our middle class strong and provide opportunities and a safety net for those striving and fighting to become middle class and to get into the ranks of the middle class to enhance their quality of life but far too many americans are continuing to suffer joblessness and have dropped out of the middle class and into poverty because of this

on women across the country i just have to tell you african americans and women have long found job opportunities in the public sector in public employment african americans in particular often found work with the city or the state because of racial bias and barriers and obstacles in the private sector the american people know that you cant have it both ways government spending cannot kill jobs on

5thyear report last april the council recommends that the unitedstates supreme court exercise direct review of all final decisions made by the virgin islands supreme court h r 6116 adopts the third circuit recommendation the bill simply authorizes the unitedstates supreme court to review at its discretion all final judgments rendered by the virgin islands supreme court the suspension version under consideration makes two technical changes to the bill as introduced first it clarifies that the unitedstates supreme court may review final judgments of the virgin islands supreme court pursuant to cert petitions in other words the unitedstates supreme court may exercise its own discretion to accept or reject cases secondly the suspension version expands the unitedstates supreme courts appellate jurisdiction through an additional reference to chapter 81 of title 28 of the unitedstates code chapter 81 sets forth the jurisdiction and venue of the unitedstates supreme court judges lawyers and litigants look to it when they have questions about the courts appellate jurisdiction the creation of an additional reference to chapter 81 makes it easier to find the new law i again

very great contribution to h r 2076 as amended that the house originally passed in 2011 by a vote of 3589 h r 2076 gives the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security the specific statutory authority to respond to requests from state and local law enforcement agencies for assistance in the investigation of violent acts and shootings occurring in public places and in the investigation of mass killings and attempted mass killings its very appropriate of course under the recent circumstances that the leaders on both sides of the aisle have mentioned so this bill unfortunately due to the tragic shooting in newtown the consideration of this bill is appropriately timely of course we should pass the bill today so that the president may sign it into law but it is unfortunate that were not also sending the president even more urgently needed legislation to protect us from gun violence while we must take steps to assist in the investigation of such incidents it is critical that we prevent them from occurring in the first place were simply not doing all we can do to protect our citizens but we celebrate that we have come this far so i urge my colleagues to

of money but yet mr karzai you can get your 10 billion a month and you can negotiate with the taliban and take the 10 billion that were borrowing from the chinese to give to karzai so they can buy weapons to kill the american soldiers and marines it just does not make any sense i have put together a resolution that i have asked the speaker of the north carolina house of representatives thom

and i certainly support paring down the budget where it is appropriate and where it actually saves money my colleague references some numbers that come from the army the army is getting out of this type of sponsorship the numbers that i want to give you are from the national guard that intends to stay in this form of advertising for recruiting purposes and also for building goodwill among the american people this sponsorship program that the national guard has in one form one very specific form of sponsorship that they have as well as a number of others but this one form of sponsorship for nascar the national guard saw a nearly 300 percent return on their investment now that comes from 68 million in media exposure it comes from 5 5 million pieces of merchandise and apparel that has national guard on it which has a value of roughly 70 million this is a huge return for the buck this is why fortune 500 companies actually advertise through nascarnot because it feels good but because it delivers results and the fact is that no matter the size of the military youre going to still need recruits and the fact remains if we look at the example of 2005 where the army didnt meet their recruiting goals what we had to do is increase the budget for retention so the fact of cutting one area of recruiting means that in a couple of years well have to actually pay more for retention in order to keep the same folks in the national guard that we currently need furthermore back to this one particular form of advertising i think its highly inappropriate for this congress to get into the business of specifying how best the national guard or whatever branch should spend their dollars on recruiting the appropriations committee has done a yeomans task of making sure that we scrub the department of defense budget from top to bottom i think this is a very strong and good appropriations bill it does have bipartisan support but lets face it when we start micromanaging advertising programs to try to recruit national guard members weve sort of slipped into the absurd the national guard from the experience that theyve had in nascar advertising in particular they generated 54 000 leads i wish my colleague had referenced that other than these other numbers that you referenced before which i think are a good reason why the army is not continuing with that program they didnt design it appropriately apparently but the national guard has got a huge bang for the buck and has actually gotten recruits because of this form of advertising i would encourage my colleagues if they voted no on the mccollum amendments last yearthere were two different amendments that deal with this very same issue if they voted no on those two amendments they need to vote no again madam chairman
