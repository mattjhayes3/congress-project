acts upon legislative initiatives that will have a major impact on the lives of our children and their families volume ii in turn provides a wealth of information on a host of federally assisted programs which seek to provide necessary services for our children included are descriptions of programs which address the need for quality education opportunities for selfsufficiency the right to a safe and livable environment and services that will ensure healthy minds and bodies i shall focus my comments and observations on our network of child nutrition programsprograms which in my judgment play a key role in ensuring that our nations children first do have healthy minds and bodies and second are better able to obtain a quality education what is the current status of our child nutrition programs as the vice chairman of the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity limited resources to the end that we meet our commitment to providing for the nutritional wellbeing and improved educational opportunities afforded to all of our children what is at stake has been eloquently stated in the current offering of letters for women infants and children in the usa being conducted by bread for the world children are our future au of them while adequate diets wilu not compensate for the great differences in access to opportunity between those who have and those who do not it is a start food can enable some children to survive and many others to make better use of educational and economic opportunities food is preventative medicine providing protection from disease food assistance can limit the stress

with more than 6 000 cases diagnosed in 35 states in fact many scientists believe that if it were not for aids lyme disease would be the no 1 new disease facing us today lyme disease is sometimes called the great imposter because it can mimic the symptoms of other diseases it may go untreated because its symptoms are sometimes mistaken for those of other illnesses such as ringworm arthritis or heart disease symptoms of lyme disease in its early stages include a character istic rash at the site of the tick bite headaches fever and swollen glands left untreated lyme disease can cause partial facial paralysis meningitis encephalitis an abnormal slowing of the heartbeat severe depression arthritis of the joints memory loss chronic fatigue and numbness or shooting pains in the arms and legs because lyme disease was only first recognized in the united states in 1975 physicians who do not see many cases of the disease may have difficulty in diagnosing and treating it however with proper diagnosis and early treatment lyme disease is curable as early treatment of lyme disease is the key to warding off its worst effects and as there is no vaccine for lyme disease the best defense
