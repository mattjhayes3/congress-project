to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who

universally recognized as critical to restoring incentives for both labor and capitaland essentini if we are to foster in creased productivity savings investment and enterprise it is perhaps even more amazing that because of reports that the economy is improving moderatelyif you can believe the economic indicators issued this weekwe can now somehow miraculously allow our federal government to grow to the astronomical level of 715 billion it appears that the budget committee only listens to those that tell it what it wants to hearlistening to any faint voice that somehow will continue to justify the runaway growth of the federal government that in a nutshell is the issue before us how big should the federal government be in the years aheadand who should we listen toas we make the decisionsas we set the budgetthat establishes the size and the growth rate for the federal government in thp years ahead it appears that the budget committee does not want to listen to president reagan the leader our country chose last november he wants to hold the federal government downlimit its growth with a budget of less than 689 billion it appears that the committee does not want to listen to the american peopleour constituents who have time and time again expressed themselves in favor of limiting the growth of the federal government well perhaps i can persuade my colleagues to listen to the voice of the future generation 19 years ago the federal budget was scarcely 100 billion who then would have believed that today the house budget co~mmittee would be seeking a 715 billion budget who would have been elected in support of such a budget 19 years hence well who today wants the budget in the year 2000 19 years away to surpass 2 860 billion if we allow the current budget committee proposal to pass and continue its level of growth even at what it calls these conservative levela then thats thh budget for the year 2000 2 860 billion i but if we adopt the presidents budget and escalate thi ough the year 2000 it the level of the 1982 proposal then the budget in the year 2000 will be less than half the federal budget woud become less than half if we allow the budget committee level to pass the question is clearly what will be the size of the federal government for the future generations well the choice is very clear we must support our president and slow the growth of the federal government or else we will continue the programs of the past two decades the lattagranmn bipartisan substitute is the best vehicle now available to accomplish the critical goals of cutting

critical amendments that will seriously impact upon the ability of this nation to meet the threat which it faces i would like to touch upon a few facts which i think are pertinent as we consider this defense bill first of all i call your attention to the comment of leonid brezhnev when he was addressing the warsaw pact heads of government back in 1973 the heads of those warsaw pact nations who were meeting with him were concerned about his feelings about detente and so they were putting him on the spot so to speak about his support of detente his answer to them was this trust us comrades for by 1985 as a consequence of what we are now achieving with detente we will have achieved most of our objectives in western europe and the shift in the correlation of forces will be such that come 1985 we will be able to exert our will wherever we need to that was back in 1973 i would like to call your attention now to some statistics that back up exactly what mr brezhnev was saying the soviets have set their goals they have achieved their schedules to their stated end thus far let us look at some of the statistics pertinent to the point turning first to the icbm and slbms strategic launchers in 1965 the soviets had 331 strategic launchers against our 1 100 today they have 2 426 and we have 1 710 strategic launchers let us look at the soviet ballistic missiles and on the same pattern in 1965 they had 107 while the united states had 496 today we have 656 and they have 1 028 let us look at the statistics with reference to the intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1965 the soviets had 224 while the united states had 654 today we have 1 028 while the soviets have 1 398 what i am saying to you is that we have not put a new ballistic missile on line since 1965 we have not put a new launcher on line since 1965 while the soviets have continued to increase their strength look at the soviet armed forces manpower with reference to ours today we have roughly 2 1 million men in our military the soviets have a military manpower of 3 6plus million what about total strategic warheads in 1965 the soviets had 530 while we had 2 716 but look how the imbalance has changed now we have a total of 6 282 while the soviets have 9 139 look at the trends see what has been happening over this period of time let us turn to soviet tanks in 1970 the soviets had 20 450 tanks today they have 26 768 we would be hard put to put 7 000 total in the field anywhere everywhere in the world what about the expernditures on defense as compared to social services we hear a lot of conversation about the fact that we are spending so much more on defense in comparison to our expenditures on social services let me review the statistics in 1960 we were spending roughly 30 percent on defense and roughly 31 percent on social services i am talking about all levels of government state and federal we are now spending 14 8 percent on defense and 49 1 on social services i just wanted to bring some of those statistics to bear because it shows that we are not spending for defense at the cost of social services now if we are not to invite disaster we dare do nothing less than what has been

minimum social security benefit has been shrouded in hyperbole facts are not perceived easily through such an emo tional fog but lets try to find a few anyway first eliminating the minimum benefit does not mean eliminating benefits it does mean that beneficiaries will receive exactly what will be produced by an application of the benefit formula to th eir average earnings under social security second the minimum already is being phased out by an action of the congress in 1977 the minimum was frozen then at its 122permonth level and eventually will disappear third the congress recognized in 1972 that the minimum was being paid to many retired civil servants who had worked just long enough under social security to get a basic benefit that constituted in effect a windfall therefore a special minimum benefit was established for those who had worked under the system for many years at low wages that special minimum will be continued fourth those recipients of the regular minimum benefit who can meet the needs test under our supplemental security income program will not lose income because the minimum is being eliminated provision is made for them to be paid the difference between the supplemental security income benefit amount and the amount they would receive through the regular benefit formula fifth aboit onethird of thosewho are now entitled to the minimum benefitanid who are cited as receiving itactually are being paid social security benefits well above the minumumn and would not be affected at all by its elimination there are for example many working wives of insured workers who have had sporadic attachment to the work force at relatively low wages they may be entitled to the minimum but they also are entited to higher benefit amounts based on their spouses earnings they always are paid the amount based on their own earnings plusthe difference between that and the higher amount to which they also are entitled thus elimination of the minimum will make no difference in their monthly social security checks sixth it has been estimated that an additional 37 percent of those now getting the minimum benefit either already are receiving supplemental security income payments or could become eligible for supplemental security income if they applied thus the numbers receiving higher amounts already and the potential supplemental security income additions constitute about 70 percent of the estimated 3 million now receiving the minimum who would lose no income by its elimination seventh another 12 percent of minimum recipients are estimated to be retired government employees who obviously are receiving governmental annuities or other forms of pensions eighth an undetermined number of elderly persons might be eligible for benefits in other social security categories were they not receiving the regular minimum benefit there are for example the beneficiaries under special transitionally insured categories designed primarily to provide benefits for persons who had not had sufficient opportunity to earni benefits under the system in short the misinformation about the minimum social security benefit is much too ample the facts are much too obscure from just a quick look at the facts it is clear that elimination of the minimum will not drive millions of americans to poverty the desirability of eliminating that benefit was determined by the congress 4 years ago and the provisions of both houses of the congress in conference now both confirm that earlier decision and accelerate its implementation finally i suggest to my colleagues in the majority party that if they are truly interested in doing something for social security beneficiaries if they really want to safeguard the system then they should start working harder toward development of legislation to put the nations basic social insurance network on a sound financial footing over both the short range anid the long on this side of the aisle

1 am particularly interested in this provision that encourages greater management control of contracting out practice~s at our military bases and installations historically since about 1955 the executive branch has supported and even encouraged the agencies to use the private sector to the maximum extent possible in 1966 the office of management and budget omb issued guidelines to be used by the executive branch in determining whether a particular activity should be performed by a private contractor these guidelines are outlined in 0mb circular asimply stated the guidelines require that a cost comparison of the agencys cost versus contractors cost be made before a decision to contract out any commercial or industrial type functions examples of the types of commercial and industrial functions which have been contracted out a military bases are security guard services aircraft maintenance and refueling sei vices motor vehicle maintenance operation of ammunition depots custodial services selected commissary services and medical equipment maintenance services the committee continues to be increasingly concerned about the advisability of contracting out activities at our defense installations and the potential for adversely impacting readiness furthermore the committee received information that suggests there mayhave been cases where the department has used contract services to circumvent civilian personnel ceilings in order to insure that contracting out would have l minimum effect on readiness last year the congress placed additional management and reporting requirements on the department of defense as outlined in the fiscal year 1981 defense authorization act these requirements were intended to prevent the department from using contract services to circumvent civilian ceilings however as importantly the bill directs the secretary of defense to report to the congress any intention or decision to contract out commercial or industrial activities during testimony on the fiscal year 1982 defense authorization bill witnesses indicated that in some cases performance by the contractor has been less that acceptable when this occurs it adversely affects the ability of both the base and unit commander to accomplish their missions one of the military witnesses indicated that contracting out in some cases would effect unit readiness as an example if a contractor who is contracted to perform vehicle maintenance or aircraft maintenance fails to perform this clearly effects unit readiness it is clear that contracting out may have an adverse effect on unit readiness however i would also argue that additionally it greatly limits the flexibility of the military base and unit tiveexcept when we need to defend commuanders to manage

bolling did not conceive i remember the 1966 committee i was on it myself the ideas all germinated from dick and i wonder where the nation would have gone if we had not established the budget

chairman as all of us prepare to vote on this particular item of this particular bill i hope that we will recognize that we are not just voting for a 2 4 billion piece of a larger defense bill our colleague on the senate side senator hatfield had asked the general accounting office to do some homework in the basing system of the mix missile he asked for that request simply because he wanted to get a handle on how much this particular defense item was going to cost the general accounting office came back and said there were difficult assumptions but anywhere between 40 billion and 80 billion then senator hatfield came back and asked some very tough questions and discovered that the actual cost will be far in excess of 100 billion let me read to you a quote from the general accounting office report the general accounting office report of february 1981not 1980 not 1979 but 1981says the following the congress and the public seem to be undler the impression that mx will consists of 200 missiles and 4 600 shelters however current sac projections indicate that even within the constraints of the unratifiqd salt 11 treatya higher numberlet me underscore that a higher numberof missles and shelters may be required to provide the necessary survivability without an arms limitation agreement the survivability of mx will depend on either soviet restraint or more missiles more shelters installation of a ballistic missile defense or a combination thereof the congress should be aware that it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate size of the deploymenkt area the number of missiles and shelters or the cost of mx madam chairman the quotation that i just read comes not from bob edgar not from ron delums not from any member from the democratlc side or any member of the republican side the quotation that i have just read concerning the cost of the mx comes from the general accounting office and the quotation indicates that there is more implied in the development of the mx missile than has been laid out in just our debate this afternoon i think it is important for us to be courageous to hold off on any future development of the mx missile until future decisions can be made and we can look at the mx in its total perspective i think the dellums amendment is an important amendment for this time in history to say to the american public we are not going to spend your money wastefully we are not going to commit ourselves to do the development of a system that we do not even know works and we are not going to commit ourselves to a system that costs more than 100 billion i urge the strong support of the dellums amendment and i urge the rejection of the mx missile system"]]}
