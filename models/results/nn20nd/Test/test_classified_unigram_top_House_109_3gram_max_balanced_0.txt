of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0001112222671508789, 0.9998887777328491, 1, "i plan to yield to several of my colleagues mr scott from virginia is also going to speak and as soon as mr spratt the ranking member on the house budget committee comes out of an important hearing on the dubai ports issue he will be able to join us as well the 2007 budget takes america down a wrong and unsustainable path the decisions the president made in this budget favor the wealthy over the working class these decisions reward those who live off what th6 irs considers to be unearned income while making those who have to work long hours every day to support themselves and their families pay far more in taxes in fact i think you would have found bipartisan agreement if we could have worked out tax cuts that were more in the interest of the working class and those hardworking families but in fact when you combine the focug of the tax cuts on those who live primarily off unearned income and the spending cuts that purportedly are necessary to offset the cost of these tax cuts the majority of young people in this country will find it harder to go to college it will be harder for lowincome elderly to get the nutrition and health care they need and it will be much harder for our grandchildren to pay for the future needs that their generation will face the decisions made in the presidents 2007 budget like his budgets since 2002 define a nation a community if you will that is not the america that we know in fact his priorities are just the opposite of what makes america great we heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle they call it a socalled republican truth squad it boggles your mind but the fact is that the bush administration has raised spending while they have cut taxes you cant fight two wars on four tax cuts ladies and gentlemen the gentlewoman from north carolina suggested that the government never invests it only spends well what does she think is the purpose of the interstate highway system that enabled our economy to fulfill its potential during the eisenhower administration and subsequent administrations or the money that we have put into the public schools systems to empower our working class and that is what we are talking about investment that will give us sustainable benefits versus tax cuts that are immediately lost most of which seem to be invested overseas and cuts in the real safety net that can make america achieve its greatness the conscious choices made in this budget reflect the flawed policies of an administration that has taken this country down a terribly wrong path one that consists of waging an unnecessary and extraordinarily costly war delivering huge tax cuts to the very wealthiest of this nation and taking the federal debt to depths never before experienced while reducing services to working americans first the 2007 budget is heavily impacted by the consequences of a reckless foreign venture namely the war in iraq the presidents 2007 budget sets aside another 120 billion supplemental to cover the cost of waging this war in fiscal 2007 of course this is on top of a regular defense budget of over 450 billion and in fact we have now allotted over 400 billion when you look through fiscal 2007 primarily for this war in iraq and very little for the war in afghanistan that was referred to by our colleague from maryland the money that is requested in these iraq war supplementals is 40 billion more than we request for transportation 33 billion more than we request for education and training more than 40 billion more than we request for the care of our military veterans inbre than 90 billion more than we will set aside to protect our environment and natural resources and more than 80 billion for what is considered diplomacy but is spent on dealing with the aids crisis on dealing with the ethnic cleansing the genocide in sudan and throughout the world places where we could have such a constructive positive effect the arhount of money that is being requested in fiscal 2007 for this war iii iraq will bring the total amount requested by the bush administration to 490 billion an enormous sum the american people have to ask has this been worth it given the results to date but we know the results are more than 2 300 americans who have lost their lives in iraq more than 16 700 who have been wounded tens if not hundreds of thousands of iraqi casualties andyet osama bin laden is still on the run iraq now appears to be descending into an allout civil war and al qaeda recruitment levels are reportedly stronger than ever but while our men and women are risking their lives overseas at the instruction of this administration and of course we have great regard for their courage and sacrifice we are not being asked to sacrifice at home and in fact the people who have been the most rewarded by this great economythat was built on the investments that have been made in prior generationsthey are being asked to sacrifice the least in fact they are actually being rewarded the same time that these men and women are going to war we are continuing trillions of dollars of tax cuts that primarily benefit the very wealthiest in our society and yet these tax proposals are going to cost the american people about 3 trillion 3 trillion over the next decade the benefits from these tax cuts are heavily skewed toward the wealthy if they were to fix the alternative minimum tax for the middle class that would be one thing if they were to help workingclass families deal with the vulnerabilities they face in providing for their families that would be one thing but that is not where most of it goes more than half of these benefits go to the 4 percent of americans who make over 200 000 annually four years from now in 2010 taxpayers with incomes of more than 1 million a year will receive average tax cuts worth 155 000 100 times the tax cut that the average taxpayer will receive is that fair is that smart i dont think it is appropriate and i dont think it reflects americas priorities and they come at a huge cost to the fiscal security of this nation causing massive amounts of annual federal deficits over the last 4 years we have seen the largest deficits in the history of our nation mr scott is going to show you what has happened over the last 5 years on a chart i hope you will pay close attention it is unbelievable the current fiscal year 2006 is expected to produce the largest deficit ever in the history of our country at 423 billion and this doesnt even take into account the supplemental spending requests that the president will send up to the hill any day now which will increase the 2006 deficit to well over half a trillion dollars and fiscal 2007 will be another year of historic deficits predicted to be 354 billion in fact since president bush took office we have had the largest annual deficits in the history of this country and those numbers are net numbers after you take the social security surplus and offset it against general fund deficits so you can add another 200 billion annually to each of those numbers so we are creating debt of over 500 billion a year these deficits and the 8 trillion in debt we now have as a result of prior deficits will place on our children anti grandchildren an unprecedented level of debt burden because of these policies every child born today automatically inherits 28 000 as their share of the federal debt and under the presidents budget proposals a child born just 5 years from now will inherit a much larger share in fact they will be paying taxes for nearly the first 5 months of every year just to pay the interest on the debt that their parents generation incurred the presidents massive budget deficits also require us to borrow from foreign governments foreign investors now hold half of the countrys publicly held debt china alone holds 250 billion of the public debt which is more than 300 percent the amount that chinaheld only 5 years ago they have a fiscal guillotine over our necks if they chose to use it we are so dependent upon chinas being willing to borrow all this debt that we generate year after year let me just show you a chart in fact of this foreign debt mr kahn our very able staff director on the house budget committee has put this together this is the aggregate unitedstates national debt held by foreign countries now the debt was climbing during the reagan years in the 1980s continued to climb during the bush years during the beginning of the clinton years it started to top oft and then with president clinton having adopted the payasyougo policy of the first president bush having to pay for tax cuts as well as additional spending we got the budget under control we had an estimated 5 6 trillion surplus predicted for the succeeding decade go foreign debt would have gone down just like this and as our foreign debt went down our national security would have gone up but this administration decided they did not want to adopt the policies of the father they did not want any payasyougo they just wanted to cut taxes the heck with paying it we will send a credit card to the next generation they can pay off our debt that is their problem not ours we are going to live high off the hog we are going to reward our contributors and the fact is that that is exactly what has happened and we have driven this nation into debt but even more seriously look at what has happened to foreign debt foreign debt has gone up like this to here we are now at 1 5 trillion here we are at 1 175 trillion and here we are over 2 trillion in 2005 a substantial share being purchased by china as i just said a 300 percent increase in chinas share of the foreign debt but imagine what has happened to foreign debt since 2001 when this president took office talk about endangering national security now who pays for all of this well what happens is that the american people obviously pay our children will pay most of it but even today the sick and the elderly who need care that cannot be provided by their families will pay we will have our college students pay in reductions in student loans and basically the dignity and the upward mobility of the american working class is going to suffer for these policies this is a situation that is not sustainable that has to be reversed now everyone is entitled to their own ideological opinions i do not think they ought to be entitled to their own set of facts this is factual information you can check in any of these budget documents put out by the government you can find that the amount of debt has skyrocketed the amount of debt held by foreign nations has skyrocketed to an even greater degree we are dependent on countries like china to keep us afloat and in fact the working class has suffered our children are going to pay the bill and we are involved in a war that we are only paying for by borrowing from the future we have not paid one dime of the cost of the iraq war nor have we paid for the tax cuts that we have so blithely passed with this i would like to yield to mr scott who has been on the budget committee for several years and he is going to show you some shocking charts as well"], [0.0001188516616821289, 0.9998811483383179, 1, "let me just say this i will not say the republican study committee i will say the republican conference i mean the bottom line is we would not have the philosophy of a few come to the floor pass the budget committee and possibly a threat for it to come to the floor by the end of the week if it was not for the help of the republican conference now they are our friends we are coffee together we ride the elevator together we walk down the hall together we talk about raising our children and all of the things that people do who work together we all work together but we have a difference in philosophy and priorities and i will tell my colleagues right now and i just want to make sure that members if you have a family member that is a veteran i want you to go grab them because i am about to say something i want to make sure that we understand that these cuts and we are talking about 60 million americans 60 million th are jon medicaid right now enrolled in medicaid 60 million americans not 60 million iraqis not 60 million somalians 60 million americans who pay their taxes every day that know what it means to punch in and punch out at work every day know what it means to have a 15minute lunch break or a break in the morning if they get it 15 minutes in the afternoon and a 30minute lunch break if they get it these are the people that we are talking about also children are enrolled in this too so it is very very important i am looking here at the families usa which is a voice for health care consumers i mean basically they are saying these cuts this proposal will force lowincome people to pay like you said higher premiums that they cannot afford and copayments so let us just call it what it is it looks good when you look at the numbers and oh these are the cuts that we are making but let us translate what those cuts mean it means that for the premiums and copayments that people are making under the medicaid plan now which is not the greatest because this republican congress has increased it time after time now we are about to do it again they are not going to be able to afford health care so we might as well say that we do not have it we have companies now that are telling people to go and enroll in medicaid because they we do not have a national health care plan they cannot participate in that program so when folks start talking about weaning people off let us talk about this i have also said we talk about the difference between democrats and republicans now here is one for the veterans that allowed us to be here under the lights in this chamber fought for this country still fighting for this country and also i want to call special attention to our members who come to the floor and give great floor speeches about how we love the troops well i have not seen a member come to the floor yet and say hey listen i do not like the troops so to say that i care about the troops we all care about the troops we all want to make sure the troops are okay but what happens when they come home what happens what happens when after the parade what happens what happens after they turn their uniform in what happens to those individuals let me tell you what is going to happen under this budget the bottom line is that the republican budget cuts that are being made in health care are 14 million below current service over the next 5 years now i am going to tell my colleagues something maybe i represent too many veterans maybe i have heard too many stories about when someone who wants to see an ophthalmologist or a podiatrist or some sort of specialty at the va and they have to wait 6 months for an appointment 6 months for an appointment and in rural areas 1 9 6 it is even worse there are areas where they have va facilities and clinics that are only open once or twice a month and under this budget with a straight face they are going to come to the floor and that is the reason why periodical after periodical is saying that it is hard for the republican conference to even vote for their own budget now folks come to the floor well we want our friends on the dertocratic side if they could support us yes we want to balance the budget but we do not want the veterans who have been waiting 6 months now to have to wait a year because the majority side has made a 5year cut of 14 billion that is not chicken feed that is a lot of money and then it goes further because facts hurt facts hurt reality hurts we are here to make sure that we give voice to those americans that sent us here some folks use it very loosely this is the peoples house well guess what we believe it wedo not use it as a punch line we are here because people have elected us furthermore it goes on to require the veterans affairs committee to make 798 million in additiqnal cuts over the next 5 years also it imposes new fees for veterans for health care by reducing veterans benefits such as disability payments pension benefits and educational benefits now let me tell my colleagues something like we say sometimes let us put the cookie on the bottom shelf the bottom line is that folks are sugarcoating a number we are making these cuts and we have to do this one says we have to do it on behalf of the katrina commission another person says well we want the katrina commission but because of hurricane katrina we have to respond to those individuals some say well we have to make sure that we reduce the national debt and that is the reason we are making these cuts and we all know that even in the senate there is a lot of chestbeating because there is a 6 billion tax break mainly for the top bracket and mainly for the special interests that they are going to push through this chamber why because if there is going to be a tax cut there should be a tax cut that is going to help every day americans but how can we with a straight face when we have veterans waiting 6 months for basic health care when we have folks in devastated areas with the three natural disasters that we have had that cannot even get a housing voucher that were made homeless because of the natural disaster when we have a government that is trying to figure out how we are going to continue to pay for the war in iraq how we are going to be able to pay for incompetence incompetence in the government how we are going to continue to condone cronyism a culture of cronyism at the same time the bottom line is ladies and gentlemen i believe the ma jority side really needs to have a meeting they need to have a meeting and talk about the true priorities of america and then one of those points in that meeting should be you know we really need to move in a bipartisan way oh wow that is a great idea hey let us work with the democrats and republicans and let us save the country now i am coming in f or a landing now i am going to tell you something people are saying why are you all on the floor every night why why are you on the floor every night some people are saying it is a great thing democrats and republicans we are glad the people are breaking this thing down so that we can all understand because we can use cbo and all the acronyms and folks can come to the floor and say we want to make america stronger what i am describing here is making a country weaker not because of the country and the people that live in it but the leadership that is supposed to govern it on behalf of making this country stronger these are the facts thirdparty validators these are the facts like it or not one other fact and ms wasserman schultz i am getting ready to yield to you i am going to take this chart out you know if i could mr ryan i would put this chart on the front of my truck so that people can see it if i had the resources i would get a billboard so that people understand what is going on this is not a woof speech this is a reality speech the bottom line is that the majority that is in control now need it be the house or senate or need it be the white iouse the policies that they are putting forth are not helping and strengthening our country period dot i do not want to make it seem like it is some sort of extreme statement it is not an extreme statement what i just described was happening to veterans the last 15 minutes we talked about what is happening to medicaid and medicare is on the table mr delahunt the bottom lineis 42 presidents 1776 we were not even thought of you know as members in this house here to the year 2000 42 presidents 1 01 trillion that we borrowed from foreign nations president bush not by himself with the republican majority not by himself i just want to make sure that everyone understands that the president does not have the ability to do this all by himself trust me 1 05 trillion from foreign nations mr ryan including china and so i think it is important that people understand this is not democratic talk this is not independent talk this is not even republican talk this is reality and unless we rise up i just want to make sure that we let the members know we know exactly on a majority side you can have a study group you can have a caucus within the caucus you can have subcommittees the bottom line is the policy will never see the light of day if it was not for the republican majority here in this house pushing it to the floor and that is the reason why that is the reason why you have republican conference members that have big problems they are you know they are even looking at their calendar saying well goodness it is my sons birthday on saturday maybe i can tell leadership we are going to celebrate it on thursday because i do not want to be here for this vote because how can i explain back home how we are increasing the wait list for veterans how we are cutting benefits for your children to go to college and we are going to put the responsibility on your back to take up the slack because we want to give tax cuts to special interests to billionaires i mean that is a hard thing to explain especially when you are by yourself back in your district and you are not hiding behind the press release from the majority office of this house of representatives and that ig the fact jack and the bottom line is we are going to man up and woman up and leader up and say no and that is the reason why it has not been to the floor and i hope that is the reason why it will not come to the floor in its present form and that we go into if we had rule xxi which we do have rule xxi here in the house but if we had a rule xxi like the senate we should go into closed session folks grab the mike the leadership and the bottom line is work out a plan that we can all work together take from the democratic budget the republican budget and do what americans want us to do they do not want us here talking about one another back and forth but the bottom line is that is the road map that has been laid out by the majority ms"],

clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what

at this issue of the irresponsibility of the republican majority they are being very irresponsible and to say that that is fine we will give you what you want of course i think we are going to see more of that kind of action by the republican majority to say that oh we are with you even if we are running the country into the ground we know better we know that we have foreign countries that we are borrowing from because we cant even borrow from ourselves anymore because we have done such a bad job we know we have raised the debt ceiling time after time after time again meanwhile we come to the floor and say our policies are working we know that there are things we should not be doing because you are working every day or you are running your business eyery day you may not be paying attention to everything that is going on not only are we elected but we are paid to watch out for your best interest and also for future generations best interests and they are doing it and i think that the paradigm shift as it relates to the american people paying attention to what they are doing in a way from a fiscal way i think will take place between now and november and so what is so unfortunate abqut this whole situation is that we are supposed to be responsible policymakers on a bipartisan basis and that is not happening right now that is just not happening the american taxpayers are getting mugged knocked down and kicked by this republican majority and the rubber stamp or the rubberstamp congress republican majority that is here now one other thing i want to mention here which i think is very very important just today mr ryan mrs tubbs jones we dont have to go back to weeks or months or 2 years ago or 3 years ago we had a payasyougo provision here individuals decided not to take it up we had an opportunity to raise the minimum wage on behalf of the american taxpayers the republican majority rejected an opportunity to raise the minimum wage for everyday working americans as a matter of fact mr ryan one of the republican leaders said i havent voted in 25 years to raise the minimum wage and if he would have had his way the minimum wage would still be 3 35 versus 5 15 i am so glad that my state joined 21 other states in raising the minimum wage meanwhile we are still here with chisel and hammer in hand as neanderthals on the republican side of the ball and saying oh we dont have to raise the minimum wage we are so indebted to the special interests that we dont even want to bother them of having an american public that is able to pay the rent or pay for their house mortgage or to be able to put gas in their tank we are so invested in the k street project we are so invested in so many other things that we are willing to allow these individuals to suffer but guess what those are the same individuals that are making america america and there are millions of americans that are there and so what is very very unfortunate here is the fact that the republican majority is still boasting about you know we are in charge we are going to continue to keep our foot on the necks of everyday americans that are going in punching in and punching out every day 5 days a week sometimes 6 because they have to work overtime those americans that know what it means to take a 15minute break in the morning and a 15minute break in the afternoon and a solid 30 minutes of lunch if they get that and they better not be a minute late those kind of individuals i think are going to go to the polls this november and say no more they are going to go to the polls

elected to that you cant be appointed to al due respect to the senate but senators can be appointed by governors if a senator was to say hey you know i have had enough i want to go home i want to take care of my grandkids a governor can appoint a senator but in democracy in this chamber in the unitedstates house if one member were to say hey i want to take care of my grandkids i want to spend more time with my kids they have to run for office they have to run for office and they have to be replaced by the people so we have a greater responsibility we have a greater responsibility than the white house than the senate or the supreme court when you look at the three branches government to the american people the oversight house resolution 841 and mr cardozas legislation that calls for the calling in those administrators that are not accountable to taxpayers dollars these are the kind of bills that we must pass one thing i can say mr ryan which is so very important on our side of the ball of saying we want to take this country in a new direction is the fact that we said we will increase the minimum wage we will make our country more energyindependent within 10 years we will implement the 9 11 recommendations to be able to make sure that we can fight terrorism here and make sure that local communities have what they need these are not if or if we get around to it

get on housedemocrats gov 30something i do not even waste my time anymore as a member of this house talking about working in a bipartisan way because the only way we can work in a bipartisan way mrs

of us that are fiscally conservative democrats that are concerned about the state of affairs in america we are concerned about the debt the deficit the budget and we are committed to trying to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government and our nations budgeting process ever since i was a small child growing up in prescbtt emmet and hope arkansas i always heard it was the democrats that spent the money and yetit was a president named bill clinton from arkansas from my hometown of hope arkansas in fact that gave this nation its first balanced budget in 40 years from 1988 through 2001 america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having its fiscal house in order america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having a balanced budget it is hard now to believe that from 1998 through 2001 this country had a balanced budget because as we all know for the sixth year in a row this nation under this republicanled congress and under this president this administration has given us the largest budget deficit ever ever in our nations history for a sixth year in a row as a matter of fact as you walk the halls of congress it is easy to spot a fiscally conservative democrat because the 37 of us who belong to the blue dog coalition have this poster outside our office in the halls of congress as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 365 525 832 151 and some change that is a big number let us put it in a way that we all can understand it for every man woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can complete 169 and with these two interstates we can bring economic opportunities and jobs to one of the most depressed and distressed areas of the country these are the kinds of priorities that should be americas priorities that continue to go unmet until we get our nations fiscal house in order and restore some common sense to our government if you have questions for the blue dog coalition iwould invite you to email us at bluedog mail house gov we are very privileged this evening to have a special guest join

have been talking about here one of the major costs of the kind of institutional corruption that is going on right now is what is going oni with the interest on the debt the nations debt is now over 8 trillion with a t and the interest in the 2007 presidents budget the interest alone is almost twohundredandtwentysome billion dollars out of this budget now when you look and you compare what we have to pay in interest on the debt compared to what we are paying for education or homeland security or veterans it is totally and utterly disproportionate to the kind of investments we need to be making because this money and on the chart here we are borrowing this money from the japanese government we are borrowing the money from the chinese government we are borrowing the money from opec countries we are ceding our country away to these other foreign interests and at the same time we are asking japan and cliina to borrow money because we do not have enough because we are giving out corporate subsidies to the oil companies and corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies while we are doing that we have to go and borrow the money from the chinese government and then we have to borrow it from the opec countries and as we showed before earlier an hour or so ago the chinese government is taking this money they are lending it to us collecting the interest and investing that money in the training of engineers to the tune of 600 000 engineers that they are going to train next year while we are training 70 that really is the bottom line that these kind of decisions are leading and costing they are leading to enormous problems for our country and they are costing us a lot of money they are really beginning i think to push the burden down on to the next generation we cannot continue to sustain the kind of deficits that we are running the next year or 2007 years budget deficit is projected at over 400 billion 400 billion and that is unacceptable while we are giving the oil industry 12 billion and 16 billion to the energy industry and we are giving to the tune of 50 60 70 billion to the health care industry in subsidies it is a coincidence or maybe it is not that the oil industrys profits are going through the roof so it begs the question why are we subsidizing them the energy companies profits going up subsidizing them too pharmaceutical companies profits through the roof subsidize them too this is paytoplay in washington d c and all the while it is happening at the expense of average people all this is happening at the cost of the american people there is a corruption tax there is a k street tax to average people who are trying to do business trying to make ends meet in middle america and all across the country and they are having a very difficult time of it they are paying the cost of k street and the cost of the corruption that is going on"], [0.00024455785751342773, 0.9997554421424866, 1, "i want to thank ms wasserman schultz for coming down to the floor today as you always do and we continue to work on these issues that are facing americans i think it is important that since we are all kind of draped up in the flag this week and talking about who is a patriot and who is not and i will not stand judgment even on my republican colleagues many of whom that have cast dye on some of the members of the democratic aisle of saying who is with the troops or who is not with the troops i just want to say that fact not fiction always prevails in history and also in the future we want to make sure in the republican budget that we point out the fact that there will be a copayment for veterans there will be a copayment of some 250 for veterans because that is what is in the republican budget package that is a fact their prescrfption drug costs will go up that is a fact so if we want to get all draped up and tearyeyed and saying i have a tattoo saying i support the troops more than you do my car that i got is painted that i support the troops it is not what you say or hear on this floor it is about how you vote and where your dollars are as it relates to respecting the men and women that laid down their life many of whom and those individuals that have that will never walk again to allow us to salute one flag here today i think it is important and i take issue with the fact because i will not let their memory be dishonored i take issue with the fact that individuals are coming to the floor saying one thing and doing another with their vote as it relates to those individuals when our men and women come home they are going to have issues they are going to have issves because they are not going to be able to deal with the effects of the ieds that are going off their friends being maimed and still there is no policy as it relates to how we are going to deal with the issue of iraq how we are going to take the training wheels off the iraqi government the only resolutions that have been put forward to deal with those issues are on the democratic side of the aisle and because the president does not want to talk about it the republican majority does not want to talk about it what is so frustrating is the fact that we have plans on this side to have discourse and dialogue in a bipartisan way so that those individuals that are there now in some areas in the western parts of iraq eating meals ready to eat okay mres for those individuals and those individuals that are talking to their children by long distance saying i am coming home soon and they really cannot answer the question because i have a 9yearold son and i have an 11yearold daughter i have been to iraq twice but you know something when a member of congress goes to iraq we are coming back in two or three days on a federal plane being served food and drink we are coming home we are going to land at andrews air force base and the air force people god bless them and i love them they are going to give us a ride back here to the capitol we are going to get out and we are going to go home not like those individuals who volunteered not drafted volunteered to serve this country if they agree or not they deserve a policy on iraq not just cheerleading resolution saying well we are going to do a lot of wordy stuff then we are going to mail this over to the troops and say we are with you they know that they are with us there is not a member of this house there is not a person i have received a phone call from that says i do not support the troops and i do not think you should support the troops that is not what this debate is about the debate should be about how we are going to deal with the iraqi government how we are going to continue to pull coalition forces in guess what you would assume under the resolution that passed today and with the speeches that the president is giving that we have coalition partners that are running in saying how can we help there is something wrong when the coalition is gettingsmaller of nations that are involved in this effort with the united states of america i think if i start giving a speech and i am home giving a political speech a campaign speech and folks started leaving the room that means i am saying something that they disagree with that they do not believe in so i think it is important that we pay very close attention and tell my colleagues on the republican side of the aisle that we pay very close attention this is not a republican executive committee this is not a democratic executive committee this is not the reform party this is not the green party this is the unitedstates house of representatives and i want the record to reflect in this time that we are making history in all the wrong places we are allowing foreign countries to own a piece of the american apple pie who have never owned at these numbers in the last 4 years a piece of the american apple pie the republican majority is allowing it to happen and it is unpatriotic for us to even think about being unpatriotic at a time such as this we should be coming together as republicans and the one independent in this house and democrats and figuring out how do we work our way out of this it will take a generation fiscally for us to work ourselves out of the deficit that has been put forth here today and has been led on by the republican majority because it has been handed down by the bush white house now the president can invite as many members of the house and the senate to the white house for tea and coffee and cookies but guess what that is not going to cut it that is not going to cut it what is going to cut it is a republican majority saying you know something enough is enough let us put politics aside let us make sure that democrats are a part of a conference committee in a real discussion on a strategy of dealing with ira dealing with education dealing with how we are going to treat our veterans when they come home they are going to be at the dining room table with their families and we cannot be stuttering when they get back as it relates to our commitment to those individuals that has sand in their teeth and are away from their families 12 months in some cases being extended beyond that another 6 months to say that oh well we had to up on your copayment because we promised that we will provide health care to you because we want to make sure we guarantee these tax cuts for these billionaires now i think it is important and i think that we should get passionate and we should get emotional about what we should be doing versus talking back and forth at one another we have to see it in black and white in the congressional record and legislation and resolutions that are passed here on this floor that are going to benefit those individuals in harms way if that is going to be the topic of the day then let it be the topic of the day let us see resolutions that come to the floor from the democratic side of the aisle about how do we deal with iraq with republican input let us see if there is some sort of resolution outside of a bunch of words saying well you know we feel that the war on terror and you know the president and people are doing good work and you know the indicators show what the indicators show that is not policy that is a speech for someone to go home and say you see i voted for this because it said a lot of good things but it did nothing to say that we are passing this to send a message well guess what that message is not penetrating the reality of this war and it is important that we deal with it in a way that the american people and the troops know that we have their back 110 percent or reassure americans that we have their back 110 percent by not shunting our policy responsibility right now we are punting the republican majority is punting because the white house does not want to do anything yet the white house the white house says we listen to our military commanders can we bring our military commanders out we have eight generals that are retired that have said that they do not agree with how the way things are going now eight of them eight generals eight generals that are saying they do not know what is happening they have questions on what is happening eight generals so many generals are saying i was there these policies are notright but no one wants to listen i guess they are not patriots now i guess these generals they have a cowardly way about them because they disagree with the president and they disagree with the republican majority the thing about it is in america someone should be able to say what they want to say and there should not be any repercussions i think too it is fighting in iraq to try to bring some sort of democracy to iraq we are so much in the front seat the iraqi government cannot even get in the front seat because we have a policy that no one can figure out on the republican side so i guess we are not going to figure it out forget about what those democrats are saying in the house and senate about how can we do it in a comprehensive way and pull it together maybe other coalition forces and other countries may come in and say now how are you going to deal with iraq and have the iraqi government take over security operations in iraq maybe we want to be part of it because we do not want to continue to go on with the plan of just saying let us just go on i will use this analogy by saying this as i close to pass a resolution without true instruction on how we are going to deal with the issue in iraq is almost like taking a carton of milk out of the refrigerator and opening it saying oh it is sour lpt me put it back in it will be fresh tomorrow it may be okay when the issue is a carton of milk but it is not okay when we are dealing with the lives of the american troops that are in iraq and in harms way at this time it is not the right policy and it is not the right thing to do when we have got kids coming home from school saying is daddy or mama home yet it is not the right policy as it relates to those individuals that are our generals and our commanders in iraq that are looking for some policy direction from the clongress on what we feel because we are the representatives of the american people it is not the right way to do things so i am here to say we want to talk about what we are going to do we know we have a new direction for america we know we have a security policy on this side of the aisle we know that we have a policy as it relates to innovation we know that we have a policy as it relates to the fact that the minimum wage will be raised it is not a question of we are not it is going to be raised if we are in the majority we have a promise to the american people of sending in a new direction on this side of the aisle that if we get the control of this house of representatives that we will institute payaswego policies to make sure that we work towards balancing the budget and you have a commitment on this side of the aisle from the democratic side of the aisle that if we become the majority that this country will be working towards energy independen6e within 10 years using alternative fuels and passing policy that will have motor companies building flex vehicles so that we no longer have to be dependent on the middle east and that we can fund and support the midwest as it relates to corn as it relates to sugar cane as it relates to other energyrelated issues to make e85 here in the united states of america maybe just maybe we will not be having the debate up here and resolutions of the house spending a day and a half with speeches on a resolution that was written handwritten by the republican majority without not one word not even an and not a but not a comma not a dot by the democratic side of the aisle and expect for us to come to the floor in a democracy and just say okay i will vote for it you wrote it so i will vote for it even though there was no input my only input is to come in here and press the red or green button because the way you wrote it is the way you want it and i think the american people are going to stand up against that kind of policy with that i say for the members to go on if they want to get a copy of anything we talked about here today to housedemocrats gov 30something that is housedemocrats gov 30something you can get everything every chart that i showed here i would like to thank the democratic leader for allowing us to have this hour and i want to thank my colleagues in the 30something working group for all of their assistance

american people understand what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a

you want to move in on something go ahead and i will let you interrupt and you can let me interrupt and we will go like that lets talk about tax policy in the united states congress since i have been here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"], [0.9866488575935364,

a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure

nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these people are goingto qualify for assistance i yield

there is nothing like being on the scene every day all day so much has gone into getting this agreement we must do everything to make sure that it lasts it is also important as we look forward that we do not forget the tragedy still unfolding in sudan as i speak women continue to be raped children die from hunger and disease men continue to be murdered by the governmentsponsored janjaweed and new attacks continue to be launched against defenseless villages many of these people have been huddled in camps for over a year put yourself in their shoes for a minute you are uprooted from your home you live in a refugee camp where conditions are terrible you do not know if your family members are dead or alive you are sick weak watching people die all around you from hunger and disease now picture you have been there for over a year the tsunami in south asia demonstrates how quickly and effectively the world can respond to such terrible disasters once again we are reminded that the world has failed the people of darfur i commend the quick and generous response to the tsunami but we must not only focus on disasters as they occur but also to respond to disasters like in darfur that have gone on for decades the peace agreement between the north and south opens new doors for a comprehensive peace throughout the country and dr john garang who will now be vice president of sudan has an opportunity to play a positive role and should go to darfur to help bring about peace i have strongly supported the united states commitment to the united nations since i became chairman of the subcommittee on commerce justice state judiciary and related agencies of the committee on appropriations all unitedstates assessments to the u n have been paid in full but over the past year we have seen the united nations fight an uphill battle on darfur resolution after resolution has failed to have any impact at least two security council members china and russia have threatened to veto strong resolutions from being passed secretary general kofi annan continues to report that the situation in darfur continues to deteriorate and the government of sudan has violated the previous security council resolutions by failing to disarm and prosecute the janjaweed ngos are leaving the region secretary general annan has sent a commission on inquiry to darfur to investigate if genocide has occurred and he has the report in his hands as i speak most people believe there is genocide but whether or not they use that term it still is horrible what is taking place and no matter what you call it the facts remain innocent civilians are systematically being murdered raped and displaced and the world has failed to stop it it is time for the united nations and the international community to respond in a meaningful way i ask secretary general annan to go to darfur to confirm with his own eyes that the situation has not improved then secretary general annan should make bold recommendations and call on the security council to immediately implement them because a strong meaningful resolution should be put forward and could make a difference it is now time for secretary general annan to use his strong moral leadership he is a nobel peace prize recipient and surely the security council would take his recommendations he should use his power and prestige to plead for the people of darfur and if the security council fails to take meaningful action secretary general annan should resign in protest i am not blaming kofi annan for darfur he does not control the security council but i ask him to use his leadership to demand a new course of action from them i believe these actions could turn the attention of the world back to what is taking place in darfur resigning under protest is an act of great moral leadership and this world would respect his actions great men in history have given up their posts to force change in 1973 at the height of the watergate scandal president nixon ordered attorney general elliott richardson to fire the special prosecutor he refused and resigned in protest and later got the presidential medal of freedom william wilberforce a member of the british parliament he could have been prime minister but spoke out to abolish the slave trade and gave up being prime minister of england anything kofi annan can do to get the world to focus on darfur would be greatly admired if in the year 2005 the security council cannot deal with genocide the raping of women and the systematic burning of villages now occurring then i believe it is fair to ask what purpose is the united nations serving in the 21st century i close by adding that just yesterday the new york times reported that villages continue to burn and that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence in darfur just last week fresh attacks killed over 100 people and drove thousands more from their homes where is the international community something needs to be done now this past weekend i watched the movie hotel rwanda i urge you all to go see it it is a movie about how the world stood by as almost a million people were slaughtered in rwanda the
