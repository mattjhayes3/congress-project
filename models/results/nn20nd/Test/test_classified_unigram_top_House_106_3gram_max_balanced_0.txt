accept it my district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young

debts and agencies would be required to establish programs to reduce the nontax debts held by the agency and obtain the maximum value for loan and debt assets in addition h r 436 would help the collection of child support by allowing the offset of social security benefits to a recipient who owes pastdue support to the state people who work hard and play by the rules should not have to pick up the tab for deadbeat dads and others who will not pay their debts as individuals we are expected to pay our debts as a nation we expect efficiency and accountability from the agencies that have been created to serve us it is important to give those agencies the tools to do the job that we require of them therefore i urge passage of h r"], [0.0001468062400817871, 0.5001468062400818, 0, "i

act of 1999 which i did cosponsor along with the gentleman from indiana i cannot say enough positive things about his efforts as this wound its way through the committees and the amendment process and everything else hopefully we can grasp hands at the end of it in celebration that we have gotten it done as we all know there is nothing more important to the future of our country than to ensure that our students receive a challenging and enriching education over the years a topheavy system of educating our youth has emerged from washington regulations put in at the federal level have addressed mainstream problems only overlooking the fact that each and every district in this nation is different the only policies that can truly assist the diversities in schools across the country are flexible policies that allow states and schools to mold federal assistance to meet their individual needs h r 800 will provide this flexibility while ensuring that states and schools are held accountable for achieving positive results and improved student performance this has been demonstrated by the 12 states that have edflex authority in current law the state of texas has issued 4 000 programmatic and administrative waivers to get federal assistance in the form they most need it students in districts with waivers have outperformed students in districts without waivers in addition the scores of educationally disadvantaged students have improved dramatically edflex permits local school districts to think outside the box in order to design a system that is truly focused on improving student performance instead of having to plan a specific project around a set of separate and conflicting progran requirements districts can develop a vision of how to use local state and federal resources to more effectively improve student performance and then make that vision a reality through the edflex waiver process all states deserve the flexibility that has enabled current edflex states to achieve greater rates of success that is why the gentleman from indiana"], [0.00014889240264892578, 0.5001488924026489, 0, "america lost its foremost science advocate a statesman and

of service georges integrity and the strength of his word were never in doubt he could be a forceful advocate when needed and a bipartisan friend when deserved perhaps what was most remarkable about george was that even after sitting through hundreds and hundreds of presentations by researchers around the nation george never lost a genuine delight in he aring of new science breakthroughs that would revolutionize tomorrows world when tomorrows scientists find their next breakthrough discovery i know in my heart that george will delight in their achievement although george served for eighteen terms in the house a remarkable achievement in itself i dont think he ever enjoyed looking back as much as he cherished looking ahead earlier this year george remarked ive thought that

destroying public land at a loss of 300 million per year to taxpayers that is a lot of money to spend on the destruction of our national forests some of my colleagues say that if we do not expand our corporate welfare to the timber industries there will be no money for our nations children that is like robbing peter to pay paul timber sales have been decreasing and the money for rural schools is on the decline we need to provide a real solution to the problem not a false choice between trees or schools supporters of this bill say we need to address the declining rate of funding for schools yet 13 states will experience a permanent reduction in education and infrastructure funding under this bill the fact is we can afford to give our rural schools the funding they need and deserve but we must separate funding to rural countries from timber receipts i am a strong supporter of rural education i ask my colleagues that if they are true supporters of rural education then give students what they need payments that are not dependent upon fluctuating timber sales our children deserve a steady supply of funding and a healthy environment this bill provides neither this bill was not written to help students it actually scratches the back of the timber industry the national forest protection and restoration act provides for rural counties by offering them guaranteed annual funding counties would no longer have to depend on the forest service for what they need they would have a budget that allows them to plan for the future they would no longer have to clearcut for our kids it
