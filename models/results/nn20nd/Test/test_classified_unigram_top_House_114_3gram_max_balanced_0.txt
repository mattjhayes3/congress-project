every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big

important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health

caregivers who are treating drug users are frequently in the best position to administer a lifesaving reversal drug in time to be effective an overdose victims family and friends as well as other drug

do mr speaker this bill directs the secretary of energy to prioritize the training of underrepresented groups including minorities women veterans as well as displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers in order to increase the number of skilled candidates trained to work in these same related fields this bill will strengthen and more fully engage doe programs and national laboratories in order to carry out the departments workforce development initiatives that includes the minorities in energy initiative that was established 2 years ago with my encouragement under secretary monizs leadership there will be a clearinghouse of information and resources on training and workforce development programs for energy and manufacturingrelated jobs state by state and region by region all across our nation this bill will help increase outreach to minorityserving institutions to ensure that the wealth of existing resources at doe are made available to these worthy establishments it will also provide additional outreach to displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers with the objective of improving the opportunities for these candidates to find employment this legislation will help to develop a skilled labor force trained to work in a wide array of sectors including renewables energy efficiency oil and gas coal nuclear utility pipelines alternative fuels as well as energyintensive and advanced manufacturing industries one of the challenges that i have heard far too many times from my constituents is of individuals participating in training programs that in many cases do not always lead to actually finding a job with that in mind this bill will help industry help schools and help communitybased workforce development organizations to identify candidates for enrollment into training and apprenticeship programs with the objective of ensuring that the skills learned are immediately transferable to goodpaying jobs and goodpaying careers within the energy and manufacturing sectors regionally nationally and indeed all across this globe as you well know and as all members in this house know the energy and manufacturing industries are two of the most critical and fastest growing sectors both domestically as well as internationally the potential of these two sectors can help bolster the american economy and are also vital to the growing number of people seeking middle class status all across the developing world it is important that we equip our citizens those who need jobs and those who are out of work with the skills needed and necessary to meet this growing demand so that we can tap into these tremendous opportunities this very bill before us today will accomplish that goal why is the 21st century workforce bill so very necessary just last week my office had yet another visiting delegation a meeting this time with an energy company out of the great state of north carolina whose representatives informed me that right now today as we stand here in this great chamber today they have over 1 000 job openings that they cannot fill because they cannot find enough qualified skilled workers the 21st century workforce bill will address that difficulty and be a solution to that and many other similar problems all across our country in fact my office has been holding many of these same types of meetings over the past 4 years with a variety of different energy and manufacturing industries that are indeed facing this very same predicament at a time when african american and latino unemployment rates are still too high when coal workers throughout appalachia and beyond are finding themselves without work when too many female heads of household cannot find adequate employment to take care of their families and when veterans returning home from defending our nation still cannot find a job it is a travesty and a shame that eager employers still cannot find the trained workers they need this is a commonsense jobs bill that will help to match up trained qualified candidates with goodpaying jobs and careers that will fit them and their families help lift up their community help strengthen the energy and manufacturing industry and will bolster the entire american economy as a whole whether you are a student pursuing your engineering degree at an hbcu or a single mother taking classes at your neighborhood community college this bill seeks to provide additional opportunity to all those individuals who are out there looking to better themselves and improve the financial situation for their families when this bill becomes law and its provisions are implemented it will help outofwork coal miners retool and retrain for the jobs of the 21st century this bill will also help returning veterans use their skills and use their talents to find employment and provide a dignified future for their families so again i want to thank my distinguished colleague from the great state of michigan chairman upton my friend from the great state of kentucky chairman whitfield ranking member pallone my friend from north carolina and all my colleagues on the energy and commerce committee as well as those who are on the education and the workforce committee who helped bring us to this point today where we are bringing forward this bill with this focus not only on underserved communities such as minorities women and veterans but also displaced and unemployed coal miners and outofwork energy workers in other places i can assure you when this bill ultimately becomes law it will go a long way in helping not only communities that look like the one i represent on the south side of chicago but every community in every district throughout this

enforcement officers to carry their governmentissued firearms during government shutdowns and administrative furloughs that result from lapses in appropriations essentially this measure would help ensure that those who protect us are able to continue to do so even during an official furlough the ability of our federal law enforcement officers to respond to critical incidents should not be impeded particularly when violent crimes are committed in their presence h r 2137 does not expand federal law enforcement officers authority to carry firearms the bill merely authorizes these officers to continue to carry their federally issued firearms as if a furlough had not occurred this legislation recognizes the very real threat of harm that many of our officers face particularly special agents on a regular basisa threat that does not simply disappear because of a government shutdown in 2012 for example more than 1 800 federal law enforcement officers were assaulted and of those approximately 200 sustained serious injuries even when off duty federal law enforcement officers remain the target of assault for example between 2011 and 2014 27 law enforcement officers were killed while they were off duty although this legislation only concerns federal officers i want to take a moment to recognize the state local and federal officers who have sacrificed their lives in serving our communities this week law enforcement officers throughout the united states have come to washington to show their support for our fallen officers during national police week in the spirit of

colleagues 2011 was a different time the security environment has changed significantly since that time threats from terrorist groups and nationstates have risen dramatically the security spending reductions envisioned 4 years ago seem extremely unwise and dangerous today in this agreement the department of defense will receive additional resources badly needed resources 30 billion this year
