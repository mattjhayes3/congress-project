without eliminating a single federal program in the first few years of the plan the plan includes a 71billion energytax and 32 billion in taxes on senior citizens according to several studies the energy tax will cost the unitedstates economy almost 600 000 jobs by 1998 and it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing construction and agricultureuse a lot of energy and will be the ones hardest hit by the tax if the clinton tax had been in effect in 1990 north carolina residents and industries would have paid 714 8 million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits this increase will raise 32 billion over 5 years a study by a senior advocacy group shows that the average senior citizen will pay 483 a year in new taxes finally the presidents plan will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a business not what the owner takes home this means that business

persian gulf we had to fight it with greek ships and taiwanese ships because our merchant marine is in a state of collapse that is why 250 members of this house in the last congress supported cargo preference for american foreign aid the members will not be voting on it today the members will not have a chance because this rule will not allow us to do that in spite of overwhelming majority support in spite of the fact that we clearly could have put it in the bill in committee but did not in good faith so much for good faith in the few minutes that remain the members will hear from the masters mates and pilots the seafarers the longshoremen the aflcio and make no mistake about it for organized labor in this country for those of the members who watch the records this will be a critical vote on the record of the aflcio one of their priorities it will be noted by working men and women in this country whohave asked for a chance regrettably i ask for the defeat of this rule"],

conservation and design program the junior duck stamp program is modeled after the federal duck stamp program which has raised money through the sale of the stamp needed for duck hunting to purchase wetlands and other parcels and land critical to the continued breeding of migratory ducks my own interest in this program was sparked by my dear friend jeanette rudy of nashville ms rudy is not only a duck hunter conservationist and philanthropist but she is the owner of one of the best and most extensive duck stamp collections in the world in fact she has donated this collection to the new national postage museum together with funds to build a gallery to display the collection ms rudy has been a judge in the federal duck stamp competition and now enthusiastic backer of the effort to expand the program to exclude young people she has personally lobbied members of congress and the administration for the passage of h r 3679 which achieves this goal the junior duck stamp program will allow the fish and wildlife service to conduct annual design competitions in elementary and secondary schools and make awards for the best designs the service is authorized to license and market the designs this competition will be in conjunction with educational activities concerning wetlands and waterfowl conservation and thus will highlight to students the importance or preserving both wetlands and migratory ducks for the enjoyment of future generations i ask my colleagues to join in supporting h r 3679"], [0.000679314136505127, 0.5006793141365051, 0, "madam chairman i move to strike the last word madam chairman i am going to vote for this legislation i am not at all happy with the legislation and the intent and what i think will come from it i think the gentleman from louisiana is exactly right this will be used in ways or may be used in ways that will deteriorate private property rights i think what he was saying even though his amendments have been ruled not germane he certainly is aiming in the direction that we must go in this country to protect private property rights to restore respect for trying to take care of legitimate environmental needs when i go home people talk to me about endangered species they say are you crazy as a loon for what you folks are doing out there they cannot understand what we are doing with many of the acts we pass in the name of the environment we are getting ready to spend 163 million for the national biological survey and some constituents who live next to the great smokey mountain park which is in my district brought me photographs of the conditions of a number of the picnic tables i know we cannot see these but here is a picnic table that is falling apart it is one of three on the north shore of the park that is totally deteriorating there are two portojohns to take care of all the people who are over in that section in fact at the top of the great smokey mountain park at queens dome sewage is running from the facility that has been put there because it is totally inadequate to take care of the number of people who come there what i am saying to you is that all across our nation we have needs in our national park system that would be better served with this 163 million than would be the 163 million we are spending on the national biological survey but we are not voting today to create the national biological survey we did that the other day in the appropriations bill i voted against it at that time secretary babbitt has said that when the money passed the appropriations process in this house and if it passes the senate he plans to install the national biological survey no matter what happens to the authorization bill no matter what congress says about the authorization power he is going ahead and will conduct the national biological survey so that bill having passed this house what we are doing today with an authorization bill and the amendments that have passed we are trying to put some standards and some controls behind it i believe that is worth doing i hope we will have an opportunity in the future to address private property rights and to make a fight in that area now we are going to vote again on the taylorpombocondit amendment i believe here today i know there was some talk that tenant rights had been abused by that legislation that in some states where the tenant has a right to the property by going to the property owner for permission to come on to that land as our amendment does we bypass the tenant that is entirely false that is a smokescreen that is trying to defeat the bill as it is what happens in most of those states is that the property owner will be asked for his permission to come on the land and then if there are tenants according to most state laws his permission will also have to be had now we have no objection if anywhere along the process people want to amend our amendment to say that tenants are also protected if that is a real concern but we should not try to defeat the right of private property owner to protect their land under the guise of a tenant law so you can see my position we have passed the creation of the national biological survey with the appropriations that we passed last week what we are doing today is to try to put some control in an authorization bill that will protect private property owners and make this legislation more in the public interest and i intend to support it for that reason and that reason only"], [0.0007210373878479004, 0.5007210373878479, 0, "mr speaker i would like to thank the gentleman very much for being with us here this evening to discuss threse very very important issues and i would also just like to say to all the members that these issues are things that we are going to be dealing with in the future and i hope that this special order tonight has shed some light i tried not to be too partisan about it but there are differences in the thought process or in the basic approach that i think that the two parties have here and i hope that we have been able to point them out in an objective in an objective way the hour is growing late and i know there is more business in the house so at this point i guess with very little time left i conclude"]]}
