americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare

massive financial crisis that they left us on their way out of office with the swift efforts of president obama and congressional democrats we are finally beginning to dig ourselves out of the hole that was left by the bush administration and slowly moving the poverty rate in the right direction we must do more and we can do more one of the most critical responsibilities we have as a government is to promote and enact policies that keep our middle class strong and provide opportunities and a safety net for those striving and fighting to become middle class and to get into the ranks of the middle class to enhance their quality of life but far too many americans are continuing to suffer joblessness and have dropped out of the middle class and into poverty because of this republican

longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive dance software 1 2 million was spent on a train museum 2 million was spent to study ant behavior 762 000 was spent to study improvised musici am not sure what that is but i am sure it is lovely not necessarily deserving of scarce federal resources 300 000 to track weather on other planetsgreat if one lives on another planet not so great if one lives on earth in a country that has accumulated an unprecedented debt exceeding 15 trillion 153 000 for an indoor water park and 712 000 to develop a machinegenerated humor systemin other words a joke machine this big joke is on the american taxpayer unfortunately it is no laughing matter in the last 3 years we have added more than 4 trillion to the national debt we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in our nations history and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit exceeding 1 trillion this week the president submitted a budget that calls for adding 11 trillion in new debt over the next decade his own treasury secretary calls the level of spending unsustainable and it is despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has failed the president has called for additional increases in spending i know the president is a good man i also know he faced a difficult economy when he took office but the president is unwilling to tell the truth to the american people about what lies ahead about some of the challenges we face i think he needs to do so and he needs to acknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can avoid making similar mistakes in the future today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the presidents stimulus rather we must lament a tremendous lost opportunity by this administration to put this country back on the right track over these last 3 years for the sake of future generations i hope it is not too late to change course i suggest the absence of a quorum"], [0.973825991153717,

words the unitedstates supreme court may exercise its own discretion to accept or reject cases secondly the suspension version expands the unitedstates supreme courts appellate jurisdiction through an additional reference to chapter 81 of title 28 of the unitedstates code chapter 81 sets forth the jurisdiction and venue of the unitedstates supreme court judges lawyers and litigants look to it when

vladimir putin for his election to become president of russia we saw the reports yesterday there were nearly 100 000 web cams that followed the voting stations all across russia and even though there have been reports from the organization for security and cooperation in europe of voting violations we are where we are vladimir putin is going to be the next president of russia i believe that in light of that fact its important for president putin to recognize that contrary to what he said in his acceptance speech last night we do not want to destroy russia i believe that it is very important that we take every step that we can to encourage a strong vibrant growing independent democratic russia im not going to as president putin said last night dictate from the west what he should do but i do think that those of us like the united states of america a country that has had a 223year history of democracy could provide a little bit of advice to a country that is just now beginning to enter its third decade of democracy and obviously has had more than a few challenges now i think that if we look at some of the recommendations the economists last week pointed to some very positive steps that could allow president putin to rather than repressing the opposition that he faces embrace it now what could he do first he could announce that this 6year term will be his last term that he will not run again as president of russia second it would be very important in light of all of the controversy that took place following last decembers parliamentary elections for him to call new parliamentary elections so we could have a greater degree of transparency and accountability third as we look at the prospect of provincial elections what are tantamount to governorships having those elections being free and fair would be a very positive thing additionally i was very glad to hear the news this morning from current president dmitry medvedev about the prospect of releasing my friend who sat with me on numerous occasions here in the capitol mikhail khodorkovsky who was the head of yukos oil one of the great energy companies in the world and was a great philanthropist in the country and was guilty of one thing and one thing only that being opposing vladimir putin the prospect of his release would be a very welcome sign i also think that as we look at the prospect of the appointment of a new prime minister there are names that have been thrown out there alexei kudrin who formerly served as finance minister would be someone who would be very welcome in light of the fact that he has actually engaged the protesters so i throw these proposals out simply because i believe that we need to have a strong vibrant growing russia we need to recognize that those countries that are formerly part of the soviet union should also have an opportunity to be strong vibrant democratic and independent without facing repression i do also believe that as we look at the debate that were going to face here that bringing russia into a rulesbased trading system by seeing them join the world trade organization would be a very positive thing as we pursue our shared goals so
