district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young

be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that

down here in the well of the house on the floor to join myself with their remarks my colleagues the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentlewoman from florida i am sure are going to speak eloquently on this very subject that we are talking about this evening and that is that our hope as we stand here this evening is an opportunity to give peace a chance in the balkans war no war no conflict and certainly no humanitarian crisis has ever been resolved by bombing a country into oblivion may i say that as a veteran of two wars myself that diplomacy is always preferable to war and i am sure that we all recognize that this balkan crisis the war over there in yugoslavia the ethnic cleansing the terrorism the human tragedies are an enormous crisis that this world faces and military escalation by itself will not end nor will it solve this crisis in fact it may even precipitate an increase with the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction perhaps i can explain that in just a few words whenever a small country is opposed by an organization of 19 other nations the propensity of that country to defend itself may reach extremes to that end it may reach for those arsenals that it could acquire from some other country of a weapon of mass destruction whether it is chemical whether it is biological or even whether it is nuclear in order to defend itself from the onslaught of an attack i urge this administration and i urge my colleagues here this evening to seriously consider the efforts and the recommendations of the unitedstates congress and the russian duma meeting that was held in vienna austria this last weekend i urge them to consider the recommendations in order to bring about a fair an equitable and a peaceful settlement between the warring factions in yugoslavia this meeting that was held with the leaders of the russianfactions in their duma which is our equivalent of the house of representatives here in congress reached consensus reached an agreement on areas that we thought would form a framework for the resolution the peaceful resolution i might add of the yugoslavia crisis those include first ending the ethnic crisis the ethnic cleansing andterrorism an end of the nato bombing an absolute removal of the serbian military forces an emplacement of an international peacekeeping force that will ensure the peaceful repatriation of the refugees back into kosovo and wide autonomy is the final goal for kosovo i think all of us here in this room this evening can agree that these are elements that we can all consider as a solution for this crisis elements which will allow us to resolve this may i say that later this week my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will have an opportunity to deal with the concurrent resolution that is the result of the recommendations of this meeting in vienna austria a historic meeting and now this resolution will simply state a sense of congress as to the meaning that diplomacy is always better than warfare i hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will give peace a chance as we debate this issue and vote on it later this week may i also say that it has been a great pleasure to work with my friends on both sides of the aisle when we have a common goal a common goal of peace not only in the balkans but peace in the world so it is an honor for me to have stood down here to associate myself with my colleagues remarks as we go forward in this process of seeking an alternative to an escalated war in yugoslavia i would like to thank them for the bipartisanship and the friendship and the collegiality that was demonstrated throughout this meeting it is indeed a great honor for me to stand here arm in arm shoulder to shoulder in this effort to bring peace to this

in 1997 by a vote of 82 to 342 in this house and i would hope that this amendment would be defeated by a similarly wide margin the reason i feel this way and so strongly is because it is our national security interest for the united states to have a strong relationship with india we do not need to be showing the kind of vote that a vote for this amendment would do right now when we are having the best relationships we have ever had with india in the entire history of the two countries at a time when india is sharing a common fight with us against terrorism terrorism spawned by radical islamists in that region of the world which do terrorist acts not only in india but all over the world and particularly against our interests in many parts and maybe against us ourselves at a time when china is a growing presence that we are not quite sure of and india provides a democratic ballast in that part of the world at a time when india has just rebuffed the pakistani incursion across the line of control in kashmir and under very extreme pressure of invasion did the right thing and limited itself in restraint and in the end prevailed i think this is a time to reward india not to attack it i personally have spoken with the indian ambassador within the past week and i am very aware that the activity level involving the question of the aid to iraq is fully within the united

caught up in our daytoday lives we often forget that there are men and women in distant lands and dangerous situations doing a lot of heavy lifting for us and this country its important that we pause occasionally and remember that our freedom our wealth and our peace of mind is the direct result of service members such as the sailors on the uss cole this year there has been considerable debate and discussion about keeping promises to our veterans and their families i think that these bills help to put an end to any doubt about our commitment to our veterans in my district of el paso texas i represent almost seventy thousand veterans and family members ive seen some of the procedural difficulties that veterans and their family members must endure and i can talk to you in great detail about how these bills will help to improve the quality of life for our veterans in my view this legislation is not about keeping promises or mending fences i think of it simply as an imperative for the nation this is legislation that this body must pass because it is the right thing to do for those who have committed so much of themselves to our country i sincerely appreciate the work that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle put into these bills because of their hard work we have three meaningful veterans bills the veterans benefit act the claims assistance act and the veterans and

that both parents work long hours and commute long distances so then we have to ask the question who is taking care of our children compared to 33 years ago parents spend 52 fewer days a year with
