10 yeafs and we would have had no housingproblem but we abandoned that commitment we came back in 1968 with the same kind of pronunciamento the same kind of national policy saying we would provide i million housing units a year for the next 10 years we abandoned that and now we are here fighting to try to at least keep a part of that commitment alive under the fauntroy substitute all of you in the sound of my voice have told me about young people not being able to buy homes in the housing package that we had there is something called the 312 the 312 loan program and many young people have moved back into the cities and have purchased homes u nder that program under the grammlatta substitute that is stripped away under the fauntroy substitute there would still be a chance for that i do not need to make out a large case for housing i just want us to continue to try to meet the needs of the people i would like to take 4 minutes or less to talk just a little bit about small business and what the fauntroy substitute does in terms of small business it keeps small business in operation there are 13 million small businesses in this nation and as you know if you read the newspapers daily they are announcing bankruptcy daily they are being swallowed up by the giant corporations the qrammlatta substitute which is the administrations substitute would simply devastate small businesses in this nation i serve as chairman of the house small business committee the original proposition that came down from the reagan administration was bad enough there is something called direct loans where small businesses cannot borrow from banks because banks will lend only to big corporations so we set up a program of direct loans under the original reagan proposal 100 million would be cut out of the direct loan program 100 million zapped small businesses that cannot get money from the lending institutions would be decimated there is something called the bank participation program where the federal government guarantees 90 percent of a loan made by a lending institution under the reagan administrations proposal 100 million would have been cut from the direct loan program and those few small businesses that did get loans would not be able to get them in addition to that the reagan administration proposes that the interest rates on those loans to small businesses be tied to the prevailing interest rate the prime rate is now 19 percent and the federal reserve just raised the rate at the discount window to 14 percent who can afford to make loans on that basis save the giant corporations so just in these two aspects we are grateful to the members of the congressional black caucus for having made an attempt to keep a commitment of a nation going for housing for its people and to give some sustenance and vitality and significance to the small business community which is the backbone of our nation sin conclusion let me say thisi said i would be very brief and i do not want to take up a lot of time other members wish to speak let me say this 90 percent of the members of this house are rushing in a pellmell fashion to vote for the grammlatta substitute and when they do what they will be voting for is a denial of a longstanding commitment made by america lto amnerican people that somehow or another when every other resource failed in this nation the government would stand by its people that is what you will be denying that denial is not on the basis of any economic deprivation or any economic difficulties that we are having it is solely and exclusively on the basis of trying to justify an ideological position a position that says the government has no responsibility to meet the needs of the people that is a responsibility of the private sector this is a sad day i have been in this congress 10 years and i have tried to serve with honor and decency and with commitment because i believed in a government that had commitment

deliberately constructed to~help the rich i hope we will not continue down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [9.138691530097276e-05, 9.138691530097276e-05, 0, "i have asked for this time to talk about the budget choices we will be faced with tomorrow as this house takes its second pass at trying to pass a budget the first effort to pass a budget failed when we had a rule which permitted 7 budgets 68 amendments 3 days of unending dialog and confusion but in failing in our first effort it is important to note that the most votes went to the latta bipartisan budget that the second largest number went to the rousselot balanced budget and that the three liberal budgets lost with increasing numbers voting against each budget based on its degree of liberalism that is the more liberal the budget the more likely it was to lose we need a budget for five reasons first to bring down interest rates by proving to the savers of america that this congress is capable of bringing spending under control second to reassure our allies that the united states can govern itself that the american political system can make difficult decisions and that we are capable of building our national defense while at the same time bringing general spending under control to resolve both our allies fear about our defense capabilities and our allies concern about our economic leadership third to lay the base for nuclear arms talks with the soviet union by proving to the russians that this country is committed to building up our defense to the degree necessary to compete with them so long as the russians believe that we will unilaterally disarm by shrinking our defense spending they have no incentive to meet with us in serious talks about nuclear arms in that sense a vote for a budget is a vote for adequate strength to go to the bargaining table fourth to protect the taxpayers by bringing down the size of government so long as government continues to grow we are faced with a continuing crisis sooner or later we are going to break the interest rate market by borrowing so much that it is impossible to continue or we are going to have to dramatically raise taxes only by shrinking the size of government and shrinking the rate of spending increases can we in fact expect to protect the taxpayer fifth this budget along with last years budget represents the first step toward shifting from the liberal welfare state to a conservative opportunity society clearly the voters of america in 1980 voted for that kind of a shift they voted to move away from the centralized bureaucracy the welfare state of the past toward a new more open conservative opportunity society which i think will develop more opportunities for more americans to have jobs and to control their lives through their own local governments and to have a chance for a stable retirement because there is a real economy creating real jobs which then leads to real social security faced with this challenge in these five areas bringing down interest rates reassuring our allies laying the base for nuclear arms talks protecting the taxpayers and trying to manage the shift away from the liberal welfare state the liberal democratic leadership budget which will be offered tomorrow fails on every count it has 150 billion in tax increases over the next 3 years nearly three times more tax increases than president reagans february budget it in effect cancels 37 percent of the tax reductions voted by congress last year when combined with the already scheduled social security tax increases and there are 112 billion of additional social security tax increases already scheduled the liberal democratic leadership budget will result in 260 billion in tax increases over the next 3 years that is 2 600 in additional taxes for every working american in fact the simple reality is that that liberal democratic leadership budget cannot be achieved without repeal of the third year of rate cuts and it is the third year of rate cuts that are the fairest it is the third year of rate cuts for individuals that have 40 percent of the tax cuts for the average working american so every person who believes in fairness and is concerned about fairness in the tax cuts has a vested interest in keeping the third year of the individual rate cuts so on the grounds of protecting the taxpayer the liberal democratic leadership budget falls second the liberal democratic leadership budget fails in defense both in reassuring our allies and in laying the base for negotiations with the soviets it fails because it has 47 billion in pay cuts for military personnel over the presidents proposals this 59 billion total department of defense cut eliminates 69 percent of the administrations increase over the last carter defense budget in 1980 the american people voted for a stronger defense surely with war in the falkland islands in lebanon in afghanistan we have all the evidence we need that this is a dangerous world yet the liberal democratic leadership budget would cut fully 69 percent of the administrations increases over the last carter defense budget so in addition to failing the taxpayer the liberal democratic leadership budget also fails on the grounds of setting a base for negotiating with the russians on nuclear weapons and on the grounds of reassuring our allies but it also fails frankly to reassure the money markets to have any hope for bringing down interest rates the liberal democratic leadership budgets 1983 discretionary and targeted entitlement savings are a reduction of only fourtenths of 1 percent from the congressional office spendingasusual baseline let me repeat that because it is almost unbelievable the liberal leaderships budget in the discretionary and targeted entitlement or transfer payment savings has only a 0 4 percent fourtenths of 1 percent cut from the spendingasusual baseline the liberal leadership budget provides for 3year savings of only 21 billion in discretionary spending and targeted transfer payments that is only 2 6 percent of the 3year baseline by contrast the latta bipartisan budget has 78 billion in targeted savings or 31v2 times as much change in the domestic welfare state spending levels to refer back to president reagans february budget savings effort the liberal leadership budget has only 21 percent of those savings while the latta bipartisan budget has 77 percent of those savings in the narrower area of transfer payments or entitlements the liberal leadership budget has savings of only twotenths of 1 percent of current law on a baseline of 1 2 trillion by contrast the latta bipartisan budget has 45 billion in savings or 17 times as much so if you want to cut federal spending and you want to decrease the scale of the welfare state and you want to get money out of washington and back into the workers pockets the latta bipartisan budget is 1 700 percent better on transfer payments than is the democratic leadership budget in fact the democratic leadership budget calls for massive social welfare program increases even when compared to fiscal year 1981 compared to the 1981 outlay levels the liberal leadership budget calls for an increase of 22 percent in health programs in just 2 years a 23percent increase in income transfer payments in the welfare program this amounts to a 66 billion staggering 2year budget increase note this is not in a period of 13percent inflation during a period when we are bringing inflation under control when in fact for the last few months it has been down to around the 3 percent a year level we are talking about a liberal leadership budget that has a health program increase seven times the size of the inflation rate for the first half of 1982 we are talking about an income transfer payment and a welfare program increase which is seven and a half times the size of the inflation rate for the first half of 1982 not just keeping up with inflation but massive 22percent increase in health programs and 23percent increase in income transfer payments and welfare programs the latta budget by contrast is not a cut in social welfare spending it is an increase but a prudent realistic increase an increase of 19 8 billion or 5 6 percent over fiscal year 1982 social welfare spending an amount needed to accommodate inflation in new needs the difference is that the liberal leadership proposal calls for a whopping 30 3 billion increase in 1983 352 percent bigger than latta and far more than is needed if we are to meet legitimate social welfare needs without breaking the bank let me emphasize this point while the liberal leadership budget totally and irresponsibly fails to cut the growth of federal spending to bring under control the impact of the federal government to give us a chance to bring down interest rates it is totally inaccurate to suggest that the latta bipartisan budget fundamentally cuts social welfare programs and spending as just noted in fact the latta budget increases social welfare spending by 5 6 percent by 19 8 billion compared with the presidents budget there have been substantial improvements let me suggest a few areas in higher education the latta bipartisan budget is 42 percent better than president reagans original proposal and adds back 2 193 billion in elementary and secondary education the latta bipartisan budget is 50 percent better than the presidents proposals and adds back 1 198 billion in handicapped and vocational education the latta budget is 37 percent better than the presidents program and adds back 499 million in manpower training the latta budget is 21 percent better than the presidents program and adds back 636 million in older americans employment the latta budget replaces 266 million where the president had none in energy conservation an area of particular concern to our friends in the northeast and the midwest the latta budget is 1 318 percent better than the presidents budget and adds back 290 million in low income energy assistance the latta budget is 44 percent better and adds back 575 million for those folks concerned about the environmental protection agency the latta budget adds back 36 percent or 150 million for amtrak of great concern to our friends in the northeast the latta budget adds back 26 percent 158 million and wic maternal and child health care the latta budget adds back 33 percent or 332 million in win employment services and for aid to families with dependent children the latta budget adds back 300 million on a base of zero finally on economic development the latta budget adds back 209 million an increase of 1 393 percent over the administration budget but there are other areas on medicaid latta adds back 1 456 billion on public assistance aid to families with dependent children and supplemental security income the latta budget adds back 2 497 billion almost half of the presidents cuts on nutrition food stamps and school lunch the latta budget adds back 226 million and finally as i noted earlier on student loans the latta budget adds back 1 985 billion"], [0.0001093149185180664, 0.9998906850814819, 1, "i rise in support of the fauntroy substitute the congressional black caucus once again has presented an alternative budget plan that offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my

as a percentage of gnp are at a level unmatched since world war 11 inflation is driving millions of hardworking citizens into tax brackets traditionally associated only with the very wealthyto the benefit solely of the federal treasury in addition to budget reductions tax relief was the key ingredient of the economic platform on which president reagan swept to victory last fall the presidentk economic program remains overwhelmingly supported today and only the conablehance substitute fully reflects the principles of long term tax reduction expected by the vast majority of our constituents before elaborating further i should make clear the fact that in many respects both conablehance and the ways and means bill provide for important changes in the tax code in similar fashion for example each bill proposes an easing of the marriage tax penalty an increase in the foreignearnedincome exclusion savings incentivesincluding an expansion of iras and keogh plansa much needed reduction in estate mid gift taxes and business tax incentives i have long advocated such legislation and am pleased that the members of the house have agreed at long last to address these crucial issues in the area of personal income tax reduction however the conablehance bipartisan substitute is clearly preferable it provides for a 25percent reduction over 3 years while the ways and means committee has recommended only 15 percent over 2 years with the misleading promise of a third year based on an unachievable trigger further conablehance assures that beginning in 1985 individual income tax rates will be indexed to inflation this is the reasonthat the bipartisan substitute alone provides for real permanent tax reduction social security tax increases already mandated and bracket creep caused by inflation will result in a 22percent tax increase tor the average family over the next 2 years it is clear then that the democratic plan would not even keep pace with increases over the next 2 years already built into the tax system only the bipartisan substitute provides real and certain tax reduction only the bipartisan substitute guarantees through indexing at the end of the 3year period over which the 25percent tax cut is made that taxes will not automatically increase purely because of inflation in the future i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting legitimate long term tax reductiontax reduction which will get the economy moving again i urge support for the bipartisan economic recovery tax act"], [0.00016882491763681173, 0.00016882491763681173, 0, "the issue before us

commend several of my colleagues for sponsoring various special orders today to address those issues that remain at the top of our congressional agenda namely the budget and the economy as the first step in the congressional budget process the president submitted to the congress his budget recommendations i was happy to see that the president decided to reaffirm his economic recovery program and did not change it to increase taxes as some advisers were urging him to do i still firmly support many of the components of the presidents package however several of us find the budget deficit projections that are in excess of 90 billion to be completely unacceptable many here in this house firmly believe that the congress must do a better job in reducing what soon could amount to a tripledigit deficit as a member who has already offered 11 amendments to the budget process that were designed to balance the budget i will continue my diligence to reduce these unacceptable deficit figures during this session of the 97th congress after all government spending is as controllable as congress so chooses the founding fathers would turn over in their graves if they knew of the over 1 trillion debt the congress has allowed our nation to accumulate thomas jefferson wrote the public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by a republican government and it was president andrew jackson that observed we should look at the national debt as just as it is not as a national blessing but as a heavy burden on the industry of the country to be discharged without unnecessary delay as discussion focuses during the next couple of weeks on the size of the national debt the deficit and the budget i believe there is one point that must not be overlooked that is quite simply that even with the reagan budget and tax reductions that were enacted last year the unitedstates government will still spend more and tax more in fiscal year 1982 than any other year in history even though we are slowing the increases in expenditures the budget continues to run out of control in fact payment of interest on the national debt for fiscal year february 10 1 982 1983 will be 99 billion more will be spent paying interest on this debt than the unitedstates government spent or collected in taxes in fiscal year 1961 it is incredible to think that while it took nearly 200 years for the national debt to reach roughly 400 billion that during the past 10 years alone the government has allowed the debt to increase an additional 600 billion with deficit estimates of 98 6 billion for fiscal year 1982 and 91 5 billion for fiscal year 1983 there is much work to be done members of congress must take note americans wiu not stand for such a deficit it is ironic that it took us 50 years to discard the higher spending higher taxing policies of the past administration while some members are ready to pass instant judgment on the entire program for economic recovery after only a few months trial such criticism comes even before many key elements of the presidents program have taken effect for instance the citizens of our nation have realized only a 5percent tax reiaction of a total 25percent tax reduction which has yet to become ef fective these tax reductions were drafted in recognition of the fact that unitedstates citizens rather that the federal government know how best to spend their hardearned money recent public opinion polls show that the american people are willing to give the administration more time in order for the positive effects of the economic program to be able to take effect they realize that the president came into office inheriting a huge economic mess for instance in december 1980 the prime rate was at an alltime record high of 21 5 percent compared with 16 5 percent today in december 1980 the 90day tbill rate was 15 7 percent today at 14 percent it is slowly coming down from april 1980 to april 1981 the money supply as measured by m 8 increased at a rate of over 10 percent this is the highest growth for any 12month period since world war ii during the previous administration from 1977 to 1981 federal spending increased 61 percent the president came into office after the first backtoback years of doubledigit inflation since world war i 12 4 percent in 1979 and 13 3 percent in 1980 as my colleagues know a great turn around has been made on the inflation front as the consumer price index snapped the doubledigit levels and came down to 8 9 percent during president reagans first year of office these facts show quite clearly that the reagan administration inherited the economic mess from the previous administration unfortunately we are still suffering from an economic hangover as a result of the liberal economic policies that prevailed during the previous years the economic slowdown was an inevitable consequence of the past policies of high taxes higher spending and fast money growth the economic trend was well in place far before the reagan administration arrived in washington it was this worst economic mess in half a century that significantly contributed to the large deficit projections we have today consequently this administration was faced with a hard choice it could have easily continued the old policies of tax and spend or it could choose to enact a new program designed to snap the inflationary cycle and to lay the foundation for a strong economy for many years to come i am not alone in stating here today that the presidents program for economic recovery has established a muchneeded foundation for economic growth it is a comprehensive fourpart plan to restrain the rate of growth in federal spending to reduce personal tax rates and business taxes to reduce the burden of federal regulation and to adopt a stable monetary policy unemployment interest rates and inflation are still at unacceptable high levels however once the reagan program takes full affect these figures too will come down and should stay down we can be certain of one thing there are no economic miracles or quick fixes or instant solutions we have already enacted a program based on sound economic theory not on political expediency it is important that we hold firm and steady to that course to turn back now to the businessasusual policies of the past would be to forsake many of the economic gains we have already made of course the task that we have before us as members of congress will not be easy however the only other alternative would be simply to return to those feeble and

persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his

of wheat growers the national corn growers association the unitedstates feed grains council the unitedstates wheat associates the american farm bureau federation and the national grange are just a few of the major groups representing farmers which have endorsed an export credit revolving fund secretary of agriculture john block has also indicated his support of the concept of the revolving fund he did so in an associated press article which followed the introduction of my bill and he confirmed this view when he appeared with me on a tv interview program no one can dispute the fact that the export of agricultural products has been a bright spot in our evonomy in recent years but while we are giving ourselves a pat on the back we should pause to consider the fact that we are in no way reaching our potential in this area nor is there any guarantee that we can even maintain our current level of performance this is a highly competitive area and our competition has adopted aggressive marketing tactics we must have the tools to meet this competition and to maintain and expand our agricultural export markets our current program of loan guarantees for agricultural export credit works fine for some nations but many others for a variety of reasons prefer direct credit they must turn elsewhere to nations which offer more attractive financing terms these financing terms are often enough to tip the balance in favor of a competitor nation and allow them to capture tl~xe export market despite other advantages offered by purchasing from the united states the commodity credit corporation revolving fund for export development and expansion created by the glickmanskeltonstenholm amendment would give us needed flexibility in the agricultural export area it would be available for shortterm financing of commercial export sales of unitedstates agricultural products export sales of unitedstates breeding animals and the establishment of facilities in importing countries to improve the capacity of such countries for handling marketing processing storing or distributing unitedstates agricultural commodities its purpose is to enable our nation to develop and expand commercial markets fqr unitedstates agricultural commodities it will help us realize our vast untapped potential in this area farm exports are vital to our entire economy they are the most important factor on the positive side of our balance of trade they provide jobs and they bolster market prices for farmers without adversely impacting food prices or requiring direct government payments unfortunately the budget will not allow us to put money in the revolving fund created by this amendment this year however i believe it is still vital to get the mechanism on the books when the

corrective legislation before that date to solve the constitutional problem in the federal bankruptcy court system h r 6978 the bankruptcy court act of 1982 which mr rodino introduced on august 12 1982 and which i have cosponsored along with mr mcclory and mr butler would remove all constitutional uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy courts by providing for the appointment of unitedstates bankruptcy judges under article iii of the constitution the bill was favorably passed by the judiciary committee on august 19 the unitedstates supreme court held on june 28 1982 in the case of northern pipeline construction company v marathon pipe line co unitedstates 50 unitedstatesl w 4872 that the jurisdiction conferred on the bankruptcy courts by section 241 a of public law 95598 cannot be constitutionally exercised by those courts because bankruptcy judges are not afforded the protections set forth in article iii of the constitution to insure judicial independencetenure during good behavior and guarantee against salary diminution while in office the court invalidated section 241 a but expressly stayed the entry of its order in the case until october 4 1982 in order to give congress time to correct the constitutional problem absent congressional action by october 4 the bankruptcy courts will lack authority to hear and decide any bankruptcy matter failure to remedy the constitutional problem by october 4 threatens chaos in the judicial system and credit community and could jeopardize jobs there are in excess of 500 000 cases presently pending in the bankruptcy courts involving billions of dollars in creditorss claims many major corporations employing tens of thousands of employees anq having billions of dollars of assets and liabilities and many farmers are now operating under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in just two chapter 11 cases alonewickes corp and sambos50 000 jobs are involved echoing the views of the judicial conference which has long opposed an article iii bankruptcy court on the ground that it would somehow diminish the prestige of the federal district court judges my colleague mr kastenmeier stated in the september 16 6978 would create new courts of general jurisdiction establish additional judgeships and create more courthouses and supporting personnel this is completely inaccurate h r 6978 does not create a new court does not authorize additional judges or personnel and does not alter the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts the bill simply grants article iii status to an existing court by providing that unitedstates bankruptcy judges be appointed by the president for life rather than for 14year terms as is the case under present law the number of bankruptcy judges under the bill 227 judges is essentially the same as the current number of bankruptcy judges 241 judges and the present jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts which extepds to all bankruptcy and bankruptcy related cases remains completely unchanged in a report filed on september 10 1982 the judicial conference appears to read the dissenting opinion of chief justice burger in the northern pipeline case as if it were the ruling of the court as one constitutional scholar testified at the subcommittee hearings i think the chief justice had his say 5 years ago i think it would be fundamentally unwise to recommit this question to him again the chief justices dissent is exactly that it is a dissent that is it is a statement of position by a gentleman who refuses to agree with the people who disagree with him and i think he is not even purporting to read justice brennans opinion i guessso i cant say his misreads justice brennans opinion i think he reads justice rehnquists opinion in a way that is simply unsupportable the chief justices dissenting opinion forms the basis of the judicial conferences legislative proposal and the proposal which mr kastenmeier has introduced as h r 7132 par from creating jurisdictional unity and clarity and providing constitutional certainty for the bankruptcy court system the proposal would create ambiguity confusion and endless jurisdictional disputes this proposal is if anything even more inefficient than the pre1978 bifurcated summary plenary jurisdictional system the judicial conferences proposed remedy is in effect a trifurcated system that would produce endless litigation over which forum should hear an issue diluting the assets of the estate and reducing the present value of creditors claims bankruptcy experts lawrence p king of new york university school of law ven countryman of harvard law school and frank r kennedy of the university of michigan law school have commented the report is replete with phrases and labels having no content other than that poured into them by the authors of the report ancillary issues and ancillary cases substantive bankruptcy law questions bankruptcy law cases and subsidiary proceedings the authors seem to have no appreciation of the vagueness and potential disagreements as to the meanings of such language yet the report purports to make a statistical calculation as to the proportion of the bankruptcyconnected litigation that is or would be embraced by the term ancillary cases it thus appears that a substantial part of the jurisdiction that shall be exercised by the bankruptcy court under proposed 1471 c may be challenged as beyond the power that may be exercised by that court on the other hand no dispostion is made at all respecting a large part of the regular business of the bankruptcy court jurisdictional challenges and problems of interpretation would be rife for at least a generaltion under such a cryptic statute the report speaks of the need to clarify the jurisdictional grant made by the bankruptcy reform act and to deal with the ambiguities in that grant there is neither ambiguity nor a need for clarification of the grant of jurisdiction in i 1471 the amendment proposed by the judicial conference would create ambiguity confusion and litigationproducing doubts about every exercise of jurisdiction by the bankruptcy court the report glosses over the many problems the flood of litigation it would loosen and the delays and expense that would be entailed by superimposing on bankruptcy administration the obscure provisions of the proposed 28 unitedstatesc 11471 the legislation proffered by the judicial conference is totally unresponsive to current needs it not only reintroduces a bifurcated jurisdictional system one might say it would establish a trifureated system instead of permitting all disputes to be resolved in one forum it would give the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over title 11 cases and subsidiary proceedings which may however be recalled by the district judge and then referred to a magistrate related proceedings another legislative term would remain with the district court but supposedly could be referred to a bankruptcy judge as special master under proposed i 1471 f thus we would have cases under title 11 subsidiary proceedings and related proceedings we would also have the district judge the bankruptcy judge and the magistrate perhaps the view of the judicial conference is to place the magistrate above the bankruptcy judge since the district judge could recall a case or related proceeding from the bankruptcy judge and refer it to a magistrate in any event this trifurcated system although it includes article iii district judges apparently could not handle claims based on state law which would have to go to the state court in the absence of diversity of citizenship the judicial conferences proposal is unsound and inefficient it would dilute the resources of an overburdened district court it would involve massive duplication of effort by bankruptcy and district judges and magistrates it would generate excessive costly and wasteful litigation over jurisdiction productive only of expense and delay this proposed remedy would completely undermine the goals of successful rehabilitation of debtors in reorganization cases and prompt liquidation and distribution to creditors in asset liquidation cases the hearing records in both the house and senate demonstrate that an article iii bankruptcy court is the only clearly constitutional and efficient bankruptcy court system the congress has now examined this issue three timesin the 94th 95th and the 97th congresses in both the 94th and 95th congresses the house reviewed the constitutional issues surrounding the bankruptcy courts and concluded that an article iii bankruptcy court was constitutionally required the house passed an article iii bankruptcy court bill in the 95th congress in a compromise with the senate a nonarticle iii court was created however i think the testimony of one witness who testified before the subcommittee is apt the congress must realize that if it wishes to resolve this matter fully and responsibly it must stop concentrating its attention on interim stopgap measures and turn its energies to the longrun question this means principally that congress must stop losing sleep over the economic and social status of 220 bankruptcy judges and start to worry about the constitutional rights of 220 million american citizens that is the less of marathon pipe line"], [0.0003528594970703125, 0.5003528594970703, 0, "of california during this week which
