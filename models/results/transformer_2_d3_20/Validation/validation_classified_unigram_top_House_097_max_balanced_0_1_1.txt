brilliant job in putting together the resolution which was reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this kind of proposal the committee restores 600 million for training grammlatta mainly assumes that the private sector will provide capital resources for highways railroads mass transit longterm scientific research and development and support for the arts and humanities it assumes the private bar will provide legal services for the poor the reason the federal government is involved in these activities is because the private sector cannot or will not afford them in all of these areas the committee assumes that there must be a federal presence equally bad is that grammlatta assumes the kemproth tax cut its obvious inequities aside kemproth is inflationary we need no more proof that the recent rise in interest rates which the administration is now blaming on the federal reserve the committee tax cut is smaller and more oriented to productivity than consumption when the economy declines further the administration will find another scapegoat in the end the american people will put the blame where it belongson poorly conceived and poorly implemented shortsighted reagan policies the real issue is whether we attempt to cut the budget on the backs of the poor the elderly the hungry the unemployed the deprived and the disabled or whether we move in a more equitable and compassionate manner as the committee budget resolution does i urge my colleagues to reject the republican budget amendment"], [0.011574506759643555, 0.9884254932403564, 1, "i thank the very distinguished chairman of the full committee on banking i also wish to emphasize the importance of his message that he eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"], [0.016423285007476807, 0.9835767149925232, 1, "on april 22 1981 i gave a talk at loyola university los angeles on beyond reaganomics the text of my remarks follows the administrations economic program consists of supertight money a fiscal 1982 expenditure cut of around 50 billion in which military increases areoffset by cuts in the social budget and a 148 billion a year income tax reduction when fully effective in 1984 heavily weighted toward personal income tax cuts for the affluent is the program equitable will it work is there an alternative neither the proposed budget cuts not the proposed tax cuts are equitable no doubt cuts in budgetary expenditures are needed they are needed because the mandate of the november 1980 election is qite clear cut expenditures reduce the present federal take of some 23 percent of gross national product budget cuts are desirable too because of the need to get the deficit under control only a budget deficitwhfch is under control can eliminate the treasurys need to borrow heavily to meet the deficit with a lowered deficit the nations savings could get through to the needed ultimate investment in plant and equipment so the question is not whether there should be budgetary retrenchment the question rather is on whom the burden should fdl and here even a cursory look at the reagan budget shows that a disproportionate part of the cuts fails upon those in the dawn of life the children those in the twilight of life the elderly and those in the shadows of life the disadvantaged the handicapped and the poor health programs are ruthlessly cut med icaid is slashed 1 2 billion which means not only less medical care for the needy but a greater burden thrust upon state and local governments w~hose principal fiscal reliance is on regressive taxes like the real estate tax on the homeowner the 78 million pnrumonia immunization program for the elderly is completely abandoned the 91 vietnam veterans outreach centers providing psychological drug and alcoholic help for vietnum veterans are to be abandoned nutrition prograzwt luch as food stamps and school lunches are severely curtailed likewise hard hit are programns to make jobs the ceta program which was sched uled to provide jobs for 500 000 men and women mostly young by nexi october 1 is to be entirely phased out useful program such as security guards for senior citizens and volunteer helpers for private charities such as goodwill industries will be seen no more likewise sharply curtailed are pro grams of economic and neighborhood development and providing infrastructure for americas industries and citiesroads bridges pox ca railroads utilities primary and secondary school education aids are to be cut 22 percent neighborhoods the crowning glory of the reagan program are to be abandoned cornpletely repealed would be the afttion 312 home rehabilitation proaram under which modce eincome families have been getting reasonable interest loans with which to upgrade their homes the cooperative bank which provides capital for neighborhood efforts in food pharmaceuticals health and housing is to be terminated maintenance funds to repair the leaky roofs of public horsing are curtailed and public housing tenants have their rent raised from 25 percent of their income to 30 percent the legal services corporation which has provided help for so many of the stormtossed who cannot afford a private lawyer is to be ended mass transit is drastically curtailed all these cuts could have aved some 50 billion and i have no qua el with the idea of a 50 billion deficitnarrowing measure but it would have been entirely possible to save that same 50 billion without shortchanging really needy people and without eviscerating programs which foster economaic development for example billions could have been saved by cutting down the federal tax deduction subsidy for interest paid on vacation homes sometimes the third and fourth such home and on interest pr~id largely by the top one~fiftb of income receivers on loaru to carry consumer purchases in addition to putting needed funds into the budgetbalancing column sxch measures woula at least partially remove an incentive which now induces people to overconsume and thus have feer eevtngs to make available for productivityenhawking inflationaryfighting industrial plant and equipment huge savings could also have been achieved by doing something about taxexempt industrial revenue bonds for unnecessary shopping centers and in some cases porno bookstores uneconomic power projects like clich river in tennessee or corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation water projects bonanzas to the oil industry such as the depletion allowance which make no sense in a world where oil brings 40 a barrel but equity aside will the program work will it produce the victory over unemployment and inflation and budget deficits which reaganomics proclaims it will flaith over and beyond the call of duty is required to make one believe that it will the theory is that the supertight money will fight inflation and the superheavy tax cut will stimsulate growth much more likely the tight money and high interest rates wiill retard growth increase unemployment and bring about hankruptcies and the tax cut will simply stimulate higher interest rates if patterns in the current inflationary period are projected only about 5 percent of the total reduction will be nsaved by the beneficiaries of the reduction with the other 95 percent as a present spent indeed since much of it will be spent by the wealthy itis likely to be spent on expensive imported consumer goods ranging from mercedess to claret thus worsening our trade balance and the international dollar and in the next round inflation moreover even the uttle bit theoretically saved from current consumption may in todays inflation be spent by speculating in corporate takeovers or in commodit la such as bunker huntand his blillondollar silver manipulations the administration projects the 1984 workout of its policies as producing a balanced budget and inflation unemployment and interest rates all hovering around the 6 percent level the administration disdains econometric studies and derived its euphoric results largely by hoping or guessing that everyone would conclude from the reagan program that hard times were over businessmen should reduce their prices labor lower its wages and banks make available their money for lower interest rates a number of economic forecast4 rs who still hold the view that logical prediction is possible among them the congressional budget office data resources the wharton school and chase econometricscome up with vastly gloomier 1984 scenarios but these economic thinktanks in programming their computers all assumed that the reagan program in all its brute severity would not actually be carried out hence they softened the assumptions the federal reserve would actually not keep money as tight as the administration is ordaining congress would not by its spending and taxing measures allow the kind of budget deficits that reagan arithmetic postulates so al of these projections fell to take reaganomics nt its word however forbidding the word might be so i asked the joint economic committee staff to put into the computer the reagan program without improving a line of it and out came the result unemployment no better than today inflation down to 8 percent but underlying inflationthe general trend of wage ratesstill at its present 9 percentplus level ~ and a budget deficit of 111 billion the greatest in history rather than a budget in balance what would be happening the computers were telling us was that the reductions in social spending would be more than outweighed by the increases in military spending and the reductions in income tax revenue the added deficits coupled with a very stringent monetary policy would bring about high inbierest rates and slow growth these in turn would further increase the deficit in short the republicans far from learning by the mistakes of the democrats seem doomed to repeat them in 196l the democratic ndministration combined guns and butterguns for a major war in vietnam butter for a whole gamut of new social programs and the result was years of stagflation now fourteen years later along come the republicans and want to repeat the same mistakeguns for the greatest peacetime increase n military spending in history and butter in the form of outsized tax reductions for the affluent with a resulting renewed bout of stagfiation and budgetary deficits a particularly unfortunate element in reaganomics is what it will do to income distr~budion it is too much perhaps to hope for the moment that amnerica can achieve a fairer income distribution a diminution of the gap between rich and poor and a closer approximation to the situation which prevails in countries like germany and japan but income distribution in the united states has been getting worse for the last 16 years and now is certainly no time to accelerate the worsening during 19651978 the share in the national income earned by the lowest quintile of american families the poor remained about even but only because of the treniendous increase in transfer payments such as health welfare education food and housing benefits asto the second and third quintilesthose making 10 00020 000 a year and 20 00030 000 a year today respectivelythey definitely lost their share of the national income declined from 28 percent to 26 percent the fourth quintile those in the 30 00040 000 bracket just about kept even and the top quintile not surprisingly absorbed what the lower middle income second and thi1rd quintiles were losing it raised its share of the national income from 42 percent to 44 percenta total of many billions of dollars under reaganomics the people in the lowest 60 percent are going to lose more the poor will have their transfer payments shorn the second and third quintiles dont have those transfer payments to lose but they will get piddling income tax cut benefitsthe reductions from keniproth will be swallowed by the increases in the payroill tax and in inflationary bracket creep being borrowers rather than lenders they will be hurt by a perpetual high interest rate regime and the tax loopholes that gladden the hearts of the upper income bracketsitemized deductions oil and real estate shelters investment creditsare simply not available to them the top ten percent of american families will profit mightily from reaganomics with the lowest 60 percent taking it on the chin this does not sound like a good way to keep up the demand necessary to take off the market what the economy can produce and thus avoid a recession nor does it seem a good way to make for social peace either in the central city or in the lower middleclass suburbs the view that rehganomics in not likely to w~ork is not held just by congressional democrats reaganomics is also viewed with some private skepticism by a good many congressional republicans ranging from those on the moderate wing who see super tight mones as a real barrier to the necessary growth to those on the conservative wing like the three conservative republican senators who outraged the white house by voting against the budget on the senate budget committee just before the april recess who fear with considerable reason a huge reagan budget deficit down the road and many a market letter from many a respectable wall street firm nowadays is pointing out that the markets are not exactly prophesying success for reaganomics as indicated by the fact that longterm interest rates auguries of inflation have been stead ily rising since the inaugural the president in hisstate of the economy address on february 18 asked anybody with a better alternative to step forward and present it very recently the democrats led by chairman jones of the house budget committee and chairman itostenkowskl of the house ways and means committee have done just that mr jones proposes a slightly gentler hand on social program budget cuts than mr reagansomewhat on the order of 10 percent rather than 25 percent cuts for economic development mass transit food stamps school lunches legal aid and so on by cracking down on military waste and by mandating a somewhat smaller tax cut mr jones is aiso able to reduce the 1982 reagan budget deficit of 40 billion to 25 billion mr rostenkowski would cut 1982 taxes by only 40 billion rather than by mr reagans 52 billion and would shift the benef its very modestly from those at the top of the income scale to those in the middle the democratic alternative represents as does the democratic party nowadays a pale and somewhat more human imitation of the republican programa little tougher on fatcats a little easier on thincats and a bit more responsible about the deficit in short an improvement if hardly a call to the barricades while the two great parties of the middle square off on the minutia of macroeconomics nothing much is being done about the structural problems of our economy yet it is in improving our economic structure that the game will be won or lost for even the most admirable monetary and fiscal policies are insufficient to bring both steady jobs and stable prices at the same time the structural aspects of costpush inflation productivity energy and national defense must be addressed 1 against inflation our only policy is supertight money by itself as thatchers england is proving it cannot lay a glove on inflation without creating unacceptable stagflation recession and unemployment yet the administrations freemarket mythology immobilizes it from addressing the wagepice spiral in steel in automobiles in coal and in a score of other major sectors there are overseas examples of what to do about costpush inflation that we seem intent on ignoring in austria the government has for ycara successfully worked a social contract in which labor and management agree on a compact which puts a productivityrelated ceiling on the spiral in holland the government has had a comprehensive system of wage and price controls in place for the last couple of years and inflation is today less than 7 percent 2 in productivity we have only a fragmentary policy though accelerated productivity increases are one of the best inflationfighters going republicans and democrats are generally agreed on the need for liberalized depreciation for business investments and on the simplification and reformp of regulatory excesses but labormanagementgovernment cooperation for productivity improvement is still frowned on despite the splendid results of cooperation in the two postwar miracleworkers germany and japan in lsth these countries labor has been weened away from inefficient workrules and management from concentration on shortterm and financial fetishism why not hfarerica nor does the reagan budget do anything noticeable for productivity infrastructure programsrebuilding america ruined streets and bridges and sewer systems and waterworks and railroads and utilities and mass transitis badly shortchanged so is manpower training and industrial research and development both public and private 3 the administration is considering killing the department of energy but there is precious little of an energy policy to kill to stand up to opecand in the process make ourself the hero of the nonoilproducing worldwe need to build up a strategic petroleum reserve we need to conserve gasoline but instead of discussing an increase in the present 4centsagallon gasoline tax with a builtin rebate for workers who need it to get to work and other essential uses we talk of abandoning the present national gasolinesaving 55milesperhour speed limit we lavish billions of windfall profits on our oil industry but from solar research we are about to remove the little that it hath 4 finally there are the economic and geographical implications of our shift of emphasis toward the military with our drastically increased military spending we may be in fact weakening our security by weakening our economy military hyperspending hits the most inflationary spots in the economy where skilled manpower and materials are scarcest military production unlike the production of civilian goods creates no pur chasable commodity to satisfy the money demand of the workers and entrepreneurs who make the military goods we had better find a way out of the arms race with the kremlin which we are now accelerating the political and economic unrest in poland brought us very close to the brink the soviet union must have come very near intervening and heaven knows what sort of reaction that might have produced from the white house the pentagon the state department and the congress but as our recent joint economic committee study showed throughout eastern europein czechoslovakia in hungary in romania in east 3jermanyeconomic stegnation is producing situations which may well duplicate on a large scale the polish tinderbox russia is curtailing her 5i1 supplies to eastern europe and her comecon economic aid trouble surely lies ahead unless we privately and publicly urge the kremlin to begin with us now not just talks on nuclear weapons but meaningful talks on an acrosstheboard reduction in the level of all our armaments only by such a return to sanity can both sides of the cold war address the problems of the lessdeveloped countries ineluding those of eastern europe before they explode in our face there is a lot more involved in world peace than economics but economics might be a foot in the door will someone willing to

secretary for natural resources and environment in this capacity mr crowell will supervise the forest service and shape and implement public forest management policy mr crowell was formerly an attorney for georgia pacific corp before it was forced to divest itself of some of its holdings as part of an antitrust agreement at that time he became general counsel for the louisiana pacific corp a company formed from georgia pacifics divested assets louisiana pacific is the second largest lumber producer in the nation and purchases more public timber than any other company in addition to serving as counsel for these corporations mr crowell aggressively promoted dramatic nonsustainable increases in national forest timber sales and other controversial forest policies which would largely benefit huge timber corporations mr crowell has spent his entire career as an attorney and spokesman for the major timber corporations as such he has been an outspoken advocate for the management of our public lands for the single use of timber management above all other uses he is the wrong choice to oversee the forests that belong to all the american people he is the wrong choice to direct the agency legally responsible for carrying out perpetually sustainable multipleuse management of these lands as someone who represented the largest public timber purchaser in the country mr crowell promoted the industrys point of view on a number of issues the small business setaside program national forest management act regulations clearcut sizes strearnside buffer strips departures from the forest services evenflow nondeclining yield formula and others on all of these issues mr crowells efforts were expended to maximize timber production from the forests at the expense of the rest of the multiple uses if the senate confirms this nomination i fear that the 190millionacre national forest system will suffer the same kind of abusive management that has befallen the private forests mr crowells confirmation will put the timber industry in charge of the national forests when that happens our public lands will face the same irresponsible cutandrun mismanagement and soil and watershed degrading harvest practices that have wreaked havoc on the private industries own timberlands the private industrial forests are now running out of timber and the industry is casting its rapacious eyes on the last oldgrowth reserves in the public forests mr crowells own public statements on forestry issues indicate that he will facilitate this dismal process mr crowell wants to eliminate restrictions on clearcut sizes he opposes designing them to enhance wildlife habitat and minimize visual impacts this is despite the fact that clearcutting the national forests was considered so objectionable it was almost eliminated by the monongahela decision after a great national debate on this and other forestry issues the congress passed the national forest managemnent act this critically important act included specific language to mitigate the effects clearcutting could have on esthetics on wildlife habitat and on soil and water resources in opposing these clearcutting standards mr crowell puts timber production first because of fear that such mitigation procedures might reduce maximum harvest levels mr crowell wants to harvest more timber from streamnside buffer strips again timber production has a priority over watershed values and the protection of fishery resources timber harvesting and its associated roadbuilding has caused extensive damage to our formerly productive anadtomous fisheries the watersheds of the national forests are our last reservoir of habitat of this valuable sport and commercial fishery thoughtless shorttermi excessively timber oriented management of the national forests can eliminate this habitat reservoir streaniside buffer strips are critically important for fishery production and ought to receive maximum protection from timber harvest mr crowell has opposed wilderness allocations because they reduce timber production disregarding the other multiple uses that wilderness provides to all the people these multiple uses provided by wilderness are available in perpetuity at little or no cost if however the national forests are to be dedicated as industrial tree farms with timber production paramount those multiple uses will be degraded future management costs for restoring those cutover lands will fall on the taxpayer mr crowell has aggressively opposed the small business timber sale setaside program louisiana pacific georgia pacific and the others claimn timber production as the dominant use of the rational forests they seek to minimize protlectlon of the other uses of the forest in the same way they want total control of the marketplace through elimination of the protection offered to small firms by the sbas setaside program without that program of course the smaller firms would be quickly driven out of business by the major timber corporations mr crowell has been the chief industry spokesman in this effort all of these examples demonstrate a mind set of maximizing timber production for the benefit of these corporations regardless of the cost to the environment sustainable yield of resources or to smaller independent timber companies this attitude is further reflected by mr crowiells insistence that the national forests increase harvest rates of the countrys last reserves of oldgrowth timber by departing from the evenflow nondeclining yield harvest formula this extremely irresponsible demand will produce a shortterm gain for some but will leave the northwest and other regions facing a dramatic shortage of timber in the future the cost to timberdependent communities millworkers and overcut regions will be severe what georgia pacific louisiana pacific and most timber companies want of course is to increase timber production from the national forests it is a laudable goal which i fully support provided that the harvest level is sustainable and that other forest resources are not degraded in the process mr crowell and others have long advocated the best way to increase harvest levels would be to scrap the evenflow nondeclining yield formula for determining harvests mr crowell has called this formulawhich says that we must only harvest as much timber as we can replace absurd i strongly disagree when congress passed the national forest management act of 1976 nfma it was widely hailed by both the timber industry and environmental groups as one of the most farsighted and progressive pieces of forestry legislation ever established the act affirmed that the publics forests are to be managed for all the multiple usestimber production watersheds fisheries wildlife and recreation among others under the act all of these resources are to be managed on a sustainedyield basis but one of the acts most basic principlesone that is absolutely crucial to maintaining longterm steady production of timber from our national forestsis the concept of evenflow nondeclining yield this concept was made part of the act to guarantee that national forest timber is managed to provide a perpetually sustainable supply of timber if we cut too fast we will not have the trees essential to maintain a strong forest economy without the evenflow nondeclining yield protected firmly in law w6 could easily see pressures for shortterm profits erode our longterm base supply of timber much of the timber industry if guilty of overcutting their own lands yet continues to press for the elimination of the evenflow formula it is clear that many large timber companies are perfectly willing to sacrifice the longterm economic wellbeing of thousands of millworkers in order to reap quick prof its h11714 co i sincerely hoped that when confronted with the responsibilities of administering the multipleuse sustained yield act and the national forest management act mr crowell would temper his outlook after all the assistant secretary is expected to manage public resources in a balanced fashion for all uses and interests not remain an advocate for singleuse timber management this hope was darkened by mr crowels response during his confirmation hearing one of the more significant opinions he expressed was that it would be possible to increase timber harvests to around 35 billion board feet per year from our national forests this would mean that present harvest levels would be tripled it would cause widespread degradation of noncommodity forest resourcesour watersheds fisheries wildlife and recreational opportunities such a policy would mean the end of the evenflow formula and rapidly complete the liquidation of the pacific northwests oldgrowth forest oldgrowth forests are an irreplaceable resource at present harvest rates we have only a 30 to 50year supply liquidation of this reserve at an even faster rate runs the grave risk of causing a dramatic decline in future harvest levels of course the liquidation of the northwests old growth is of less concern to the timber corporations represented by mr crowell than it is to smaller companies and independent mills it is of less concern to the major timber corporations than it is to the miliworkers and timberdependent communities in the northwest the big corporations are already making plans to leave the northwest they can move their operations to the southeastern united states to southeast asia to brazil the smaller companies and their employees are left to watch the clearcuts grow back this was not merely an offhand statement by mr crowell it is a reflection of a mind set of someone who has long served the interests of major timber corporations it is a policy which has been advocated by them for years to see someone who holds that point of view given authority over the forest service ought to deeply disturb those concerned with sustained yield management of our natural resources the timber industry is fond of saying that it is more efficient to liquidate our reserves of oldgrowth timber because it is dead decadent and dying they want to cut it as fast as possible so that it can be replaced by thrifty young stands they portray the oldgrowth forests as on the verge of collapse and themselves as heroes for rescuing the public from imminent resource waste this line is sheer nonsense those forests have been standing for 200 300 400 years or longer they are at an equilibrium between mortality and new growth they are not going to fall down and go to

involvement in any spethe court found that kpc and alas cif ic matter effecting louisiana pacifkan lumber pulp co a japanese ic does this mean that he will avoid having to do with all forest service activities related to timber management in alaska apparently so the forest service has several actionis that it could pursue in response to the antitrust verdict of guilty the conspirators manipulated stumpage values by falsely reporting the costs of harvests and the price of materials sold stumpage value manipulation is a breach of contract the forest service could sue the corporation to recover funds lost to the treasury the forest service could discharge the 50year contracts the forest service could debar the firms from bidding on timber sales in the tongass it strains credibility to assume that the personnel within the agency would be insensitive to their assistant secretarys past association with louisiana in considering these options the activities ofgeorgia pacific and louisiana pacific are so closely tied to usfs actions and policies it is difficult to imagine that mr crowell would not be continually confronted with potential conflicts of interest for example how can he deal with the issue of departures from the evenflow nondeclining yield formula when the nations major public timber purchaser louisiana pacific would obviously benefit how will he deal with the issue of log exports and enforce the federal regulations against the substitution of federal timber for privately exported logs when his former employers may benefit from such activities mr crowell presided over a national forest products association task force which recommended weakening n m a regulations dealing with clearcut sizes and harvesting within streamside buffer zones how can he deal in a balanced fashion with regulatory changes that will dramatically effect watershed qualities fisheries forest diversity and oldgrowth forests when weakening of these regulations will have a direct financial benefit to his former employers and other timber companies in mr crowells reclusal statement he said that he would not involve himself in any matters regarding the sbas timber sale setaside program he said he would not involve himself in specific matters dealing with louisiana pacific or georgia pacific he also said he would not involve himself in matters arising under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act in that it would effect a pesticide corporation in which his wife holds stock now it appears that he will have to excuse himself from decisions or policies affecting national forest management on the tongass national forestthe major timberproducing area of alaska in summary we are confronted with an assistant secretary designee who assures the senate that he will avoid any dealings in at least three major areas of his jurisdiction he is agreed to tie his own hands in these matters but there are two problems with this kind of promise first they are major areas that any assistant secretary for natural resources and environment must deal with second his entire history as attorney and general counsel for georgia pacific and louisiana pacific and as spokesman for the large timber corporations in general indicates that these are among the very areas in which he will want to involve himself so the country faces the prospect of an assistant secretary hobbled in major areas of his responsibility or who will in time involve himself in areas he has assured us he would avoid in his prenomination reclusal statement now the decision of the federal court that a wholly owned louisiana pacific subsidiary has been caught in a major violation of antitrust lawsconspiracy to monopolize the timber industry in southeast alaska and to defraud the treasury of timber revenueconfronts mr crowell with additional conflicts of interests that will remove even more areas from his sphere of operation mr crowells philosophic points of view are i believe damaging to the longterm health and productivity of our national forests but his philosophy is secondary to the major issue of his close ties to the timber industry the administration can conceivably find many who share mr crowells point of view on timber management but if mr crowells nomination is approved his past associations will be a constant burden he will inevitably face conflicts of interest in implementing this administrations forest policies in general further he will face a direct conflict of interest in any action he takes in alaskan national forests and in anything

number of my colleagues the 1982 housing bill this bill is a comprehensive positive program to address the great and growing problems of the housing industry of those who depend on it and those millions of americans who cannot now afford to buy or rent a decent home this program speaks not only to the needs of urban dwellers but to those who live in rural areas as well the reagan budget program would actually cause a reduction of 46 000 housing units that are now planned and for which funding is available the reagan program is a wholesale abandonment of efforts to provide affordable housing for the majority who are shut out of the housing market today the bill my colleagues and i are offering today will provide about 250 000 new assisted housing units in fiscal year 1983 under the programs of the department of housing and urban development and it will also provide 57 000 new assisted housing units in the rural areas served by the farmers home administration the cost of our program is modestno more than is available for the current fiscal year for housing assistance which in turn is much less than was available last year modest as it is however our bill is critically needed and is a positive program as against the reagan program of wholesale iandonment and retreat the housing act of 1982 will provide assistance for homebuyers who have modest incomes these are people who could if interest rates were anything like reasonable afford homes without assistance the bill would make available up to 100 000 homes under the section 235 q program and buyers whose incomes are up to 130 percent of area median income could qualify the subsidy would be used to reduce interest payments to a rate of 9 percentsteep by historic terms usurious by my own standards but still affordable by people who have modest incomes the subsidy provided in this program would be limited to 10 yearson the belief that as incomes rise people will be able to eliminate their need for the subsidy moreover there is provision in the bill for a recapture of the subsidy payments additionally our bill will create a new program to replace the existing section 8 multifamily housing program under our bill local government agencies could work with private developers to develop affordable rental housing the subsidy payment would be extremely flexible so that the maximum incentive will exist to create efficient and effective financing plans the subsidy could be in the form of an outright capital grant it coul8a be in the form of a loan a rent subsidy or even a loan for purchase of land it could be any reasonable device that would make the project financially feasible and at the same time modest in cost to the federal government additionally the bill encourages local units of government to do their part by contributions in kind or in cash toward project development this encouragement comes through a preference to project applications that show local participation in the development cost again flexibility is the keythe kind of flexibility that made the urban development action grant the efficient effective program that it has been the bill continues the current level of effort with respect to lowcost public housing development and rehabilitation and provides for adequate operating subsidies as well we recognize that there is an urgent need for lowrent public housing that there is a need to maintain the existing stock and that adequate operating funds are essential to prevent the financial failure of numerous housing agencies we provide in this bill for a full range of rural housing programs at least maintaining existing levels of effort the amount of substandard housing in rural america is disproportionate and our program does not turn its back on the need for better housing in small towns and on farms our bill also recognizes the ravages of unemployment with the resulting rise in mortgage foreclosures we do not believe that the involuntary victims of the nations economic distress should have their misery compounded through the loss of hardearned home equity accordingly the bill provides for an emergency homeowners assistance program one that makes loans available to people who are faced with foreclosures because of involuntary and temporary economic distress the bill extends the various insuring and secondary credit market authori ties all of which are vital tools for the financing and production of homes all of which have proved their worth and all of which have earned the support of everyone who is concerned with housing we recognize that the depression of the housing industry will not end until the economy is set straight but we also recognize that doing nothing is worse than nothing doing nothing will only accelerate the growing crisis among those who seek affordable housing only deepen the depression of the housing industry and worst of all constitute a retreat from our historic commitment to decent and affordable housing for this nation the administration is not offering a housing program it is offering an antimarch 4 1989 housing programan attempt to dis mantle and discard programs that an needed that work ahd that make positive contribution not only to thi wellbeing of the american people bu a positive contribution to the economy as well our bill by contrast is a reaf firmation of the historic and necessary national commitment to housing we understand the certali truth tha without a national housing policy there will never be sufficient housing let alone decent and affordable hous ing for the nation we offer a con structive effective program that learns from the lessons of the past the nonpolicy and antipolicy of the administration by shameful contrast seeks to undo all that

constructive alternative budget to what it is that the president proposed and those who would hurt the little people of this nation would propose here today and in the few days to come i rise to address the energy function of the congressional black caucus budget this function includes the department of energy programs including research and development of new energy sources energy conservation and preparedness civilian and defense nuclear programs and rural electrification projects the congressional black caucus alternative rejects the premise that energy policy can adequately be addressed on the local level since energy is a nati nal concern the congressional bla k caucus budget retains the department of energy the doe was created to allow for a comprehensive national energy policy on energy production and supply problems as well as on international energy issues in addition the doe amasses data on energy and coordinates and funds energy research and development the dismantling of doe would result in a disunifled response to energy concerns and a disparate application of energy policy despite the vast amount of discussion which has been heard on the issue of dismantlement of doe there has been no clear showing that significant savings will accrue from dismantlement most of the department of energys functions would be scattered among the departments of commerce interior and justice another deleterious result of the threatened dismantlement of doe has been the loss of expertise due to job shifts and reductions in force because of these losses of the past and those to come the requisite skil d persons who could run many of the er ergy programs targeted for transfer are not available to the chosen departments one other program which the congressional black caucus particularly favors for continued funding is the does office of minority economic impact the administration has zero funded this program despite the fact that its funds have already been authorized the office of minority economic impact has research programs at black colleges a minority bank development program a minority business loan program and an engineering college program to name a few of its projects in addition to these activities omei has performed the task of monitoring the impact of energy programs and policies on minorities and making policy recommendations to the secretary of energy the congressional black caucus supports refunding of omei in the amount of 1 635 million a phenomenal but little known fact about this administrations energy budget is that a ful 88 percent is dedicated to nuclear programs this leaves only 12 percent for programs such as fossil research solar and conservation programs the congressional black caucus has provided some relief to the disparity in the use of the taxpayers dollar specifically the civilian nuclear programs have increased since 1981 by 98 million the atomic energy defense activity funding has increased by 1 84 billion during that period since these programs were not subjected to the severe reductions imposed on other vital programs the cbc had redistributed 20 percent of the proposed reagan increases in the atomic energy and nuclear fission programs to other energy projects the cbc again goes on record as we did last year opposing the clinch river breeder reactor deleting 253 million in funding for this project although core programs will be maintained despite these reductions the benefit of the cbcs funding allocations will be to allow vital programs which were targeted for elimination to continue energy conservation solar and renewable energy programs have been decimated over the past 2 fiscal years by the budget reductions energy conservation was reduced from a 1981 funding level of 712 million to the current administrations proposed authorization for 1983 of 21 million solar and renewable energy programs were reduced from a 1981 authorization of 500 million to the current administrations 72 million for 1983 this is a trend which cannot continue the result of the budget cuts in these areas is a rejection of the need to use energy in an efficient manner the result of cuts in these areas is the elimination of state emergency plan ning funds lowincome weatherization programs energy efficiency research programs schools and hospitals pro grams minimum energy performance standards for new appliances among others these are effective programs for example under the home weatherization program homes weatherized jumped from 96 355 in 1978 to 291 ooc in 1981 the energy savings were 23 4 percent and all initial expenditure were recouped in energy saving within 4 years the matching funds given foi energy efficiency investments ir schools and hospitals and local govern ment buildings is part of another pro gram which showed great success par ticularly in light of the fact that thes buildings rank among the top ir energy consumption the investmeni in energy efficient equipment anc practices led to the federal share cosi saved for 1 barrel of oil equivalent ir public institutions to be estimated al 2 28 compared to 34 for a barrel oi oil on the market the savings wa 4 31 for hospitals and 11 20 fo1 schools another very significant program o energy conservation is the researcd and development of energy conserva tion measures in conjunction with u a industry more sophisticated cogenera tion systems recovery of waste heat systems of computer control and com bustion efficiencyall were program where costs were shared between in dustry and the federal government for the purpose of finding a more effi clent use of energy foreign industries have becomi more energy efficient than the u s counterparts foreign government give economic support to energy effl clency research development by thes industries the reduction of ou energy conservation programs and thi resultant dropping of private indue tries research programs may well lea to greater unitedstates inability to compet and subsequent reductions in labo forces for example the japanese use one half the amount of energy in makin steel than american industries us not long ago in our energy committee the concern was repeatedly raised tha the alaskan pipeline being built by combined effort of many america companies may not be made with u e steel but rather with foreign steel be cause of the price difference energ efficiency use is crucial the lack of el ficiency is costly the reagan budget cutters maintal as their hue and cry that the state should shoulder the burden for implf menting programs that the federt government abandoned state pr grams have been estimated to say 192 1 trillion btus with a lifetim dollar savings of 13 billion it has cost 217 million to run those offices that amount is 196 million more than the entire energy conservation budget under reagan in 1981 50 percent of the state energy offices relied on 80 percent or more federal dollars indubitably the extreme cuts to the energy conservation budget will mean the closing of these offices or at least severe paring down and ultimately the loss of these energy and dollar savings the inefficiency of these administrations budget cuts is shown again the congressional black caucus tries to do something about these budget cuts by offering an alternative to the reagan budget by offering a more balanced budget in terms of the division of funds among the various programs in my opinion the challenge and the goal of government is to strike the happy median whereby all facets of our national community are served the pendulum of government during times on economic distress should not swing so lopsidedly that those who only have a weak grasp on the american ladder of success

care better housing better nutrition and better community services americans are living longer today than at any other time in our history these improvements in the quality of life for older americans were brought about to a large degree by the federal government previous administrations realized that the federal government along with society had a moral obligation to insure that the elderly could lead safe and productive lives these programs are indeed necessary since according to the 1980 census one out of six older americans lives on an income below the poverty level when president reagan outlined his program for economic recovery before a joint session of congress and the american people on february 18 1981 he stated we will continue to fulfill the obligations which spring from our national conscience those who through no fault of their own must depend on the rest of us the poverty stricken the disabled the elderly all of those with true need can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exempt from any cuts what has happened to that promise only 4 months after president reagan made that pledge the administrationbacked omnibus reconciliation act was passed the effect of this legislation on senior citizens programs was severe food stamps were cut 16 percent social security and railroad civil service and military retirement were cut 20 percent medicare and medicaid were cut 10 percent sharp reductions planned for social security were shelved only after a massive protest by recipients however the administration was not content to make life harder for those to whom hardship was no stranger it set out to comfort the already comfortable through a tax bill which favors the wealthy the american people were assured by the administration that this program of reductions in funds for social programs and taxbreaks for the wealthy would pull the economy out of its slump and provide benefits for all americans where are we nearly 1 year after this program was enacted the jobless rate now stands at 9 4 percent nationwidethe highest rate since the great depression this figure represents an increase of 2 5 million people on the jobless roles since last july when the republican program was enacted instead of reevaluating a program that obviously is not working the administration is simply offering the american people more of the same in its budget proposals for fiscal year 1983 the sum of the new budget proposals would mean further misery particularly for the elderly poor let me cite a few examples of the impact of some of these proposals according to the congressional budget office 2 5 million elderly who now receive food stamps would lose their benefits altogether while another 66 percent would have their benefits reduced food stamp assistance would be considered as income when determining eligibility for housing assistance similarly energy assistance would be counted as income when determining eligibility for food stamps the cumulative effect of these three proposals alone would leave many lowincome elderly with a catch22 dilemma do they choose to eat stay warm or have adequate housing unfortunately the litany of hardships the admininstrations proposals if enacted would impose continues medicare would be cut by another 2 4 billion medicaid would be cut by an additional 1 9 bilion supplemental security income would be reduced 286 million in 1982 and 1 1 billion in 1987 programs which are funded under the older americans act would have their funding levels reduced from 986 million in 1982 to 652 1 million in 1983 the title v employment program would be abolished according to the national council on aging this would cause 80 000 lowincome elderly individuals to lose jobs which enable them to be independent as well as provide valuable community service apparently undaunted by massive public support for social security the administration appears ready to push for cuts in the program once again it supported a measure adopted by the senate budget committee which called for 40 billion in unspecified cuts in social security the administration prefers to leave

administration has not kept its promise to protect the social safety net of programs which benefit the needy and the elderly this pledge has apparently been lost in the enthusiasm for a stronger defense a stubborn commitment to an economic program that is not working and the need to lower the huge deficit brought about as a result of the administrations economic policies i too favor a strong national defense and a lowered deficit however these goals can be achieved in ways other than by making further cuts in needed social programs in my view an essential first step in lowering the deficit is to cancel the third year of the kemprothreagan tax cut the military budget also needs to be given as careful scrutiny as the social programs which have already borne their share of budget cuts we must restore the american peoples shaken faith in their government as a vehicle for social and economic justice we cannot abandon the elderly and truly needy members of our socitey it would be

a second term which she served until august 1969 during her tenure at the mint ms adams launched a successful program to alleviate a nationwide coin shortage and supervised the construction of the new mint in philadelphia through her position on the joint commission on the coinage eva adams was frequently called upon to make recommendations to the president the congress and the secretary of the treasury on coinage and related problems ms adams oversaw the change from silver to clad coinage in 1965 she has received a number of awards for her outstanding work as mint director including the treasury departments exceptional service award in light of this considerable experience ms adams c9mments on the two olympic commemorative coin proposals now before congress are particularly noteworthy in her letter she endorses my bill h r 3879 which calls for a single silver dollar to be sold directly to the public by the mint the former director opposes the other proposal contained in s 1230 and h r 3958 which calls for the minting of numerous coins to be sold through private marketers ms adams objections to this legislation as outlined in her letter are very similar to those i have previously raised s 1230 and h r 3958 call for the minting of 25 different coins i have repeatedly stated my opposition to this provision multiple issues are confusing and discouraging to the buying public and the cost of owning a complete set of coins under this bill would be prohibitive as a result i fear that these coins will not sell ahd that the entire program will end in failure ms adams shares these concerns and worries that this unnecessarily elaborate program would place an unfair burden on the mints facilities as the mint has already been ordered to reduce its budget by 16 percent since the administration suggests that we all do more with less i wonder why s 1230 and h r 3958 suggest that we do less with more ms adams also opposes the private marketing of official unitedstates commemorative coins i believe that this provision will contribute to the high costs consumers will be forced to pay should this program get underway in addition i have frequently questioned the propriety of allowing the consortium of lazardfreres an international investment firm occidental petroleum and the franklin mint to market these coins it is not clear why this contract was made without the benefit of the competitive bidding process and as ms adams reminds us in her letter it was the private marketing of coins that led to the termination of commemorative coinage in 1954 both eva adams and i agree that the 1984 summer olympics should be marked by the minting of a commemorative coin americas olympic athletes have certainly earned our respect and they deserve our financial support however we would like to approve a sensible program to celebrate this event and raise money for our athletes the proposal set forth in s 1230 and h r 3958 is not the best way to

in el salvador over the last several weeks and the administrations stepped up security commitments to the duarte government indicate that the circumstances of the conflict in el salvador are changing rapidly from those a year ago when the administration assured members of this house it had no legal obligation under the war powers resolution to report to congress on the involvement of unitedstates military personnel in el salvador in a memorandum early last year the administration argued that unitedstates advisers in el salvador were not engaged in hostilities nor equipped for combat nor located in areas where such involvement would likely occur it is no longer clear that such a legal judgment holds true today the war powers resolution by which our current military involvement in el salvador must be judged calls on the president to consult with congress before introducing unitedstates armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances further in any case in which such forces are introduced into hostilities or are in danger of imminent involvement in hostilities or when forces are introduced into the territory of a foreign nation while equipped for combat with certain exceptions such as training of in numbers which substantially enlarge unitedstates armed forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation the president is required to submit a report within 48 hours to the congress stating the circumstances requiring the involvement of unitedstates military personnel the statutory basis for his declsion and the estimated scope and duration of hostilities or involvement the resolution provides further that such forces will be withdrawn within 60 days after the president reports to congress that he has introduced such forces unless congress acts to authorize the continued presence of unitedstates military personnel in the area concerned in response to questions raised concerning the administrations obligation under the war powers resolution a year ago the state department submitted a memorandum to the congress stating that provisions of the war powers resolution did not apoly to the serding of unitedstates military advisers to el salvador because they had not been introduced into hostilities nor were they in danger of imminent involvement in iuch hostilities instead unitedstates personnel would be stationed in carefully selected areas and special precautions would be taken to provide for their constant security unitedstates personnel would neither accompaty salvildoran forces in combat situations nor act as combat advisers and would carry only personal sidearms recent events in el salvador have proved sufficiently alarming to the administration to prompt a tripling of our security assistance to the duarte government and to publicly leave the door ajar to the possibility of sending additional advisers and even unitedstates combat troops these events require that the administration thoroughly reevaluate its legal obligations to the unitedstates congress under the war powers resolution the bold guerrilla attack on ilopango air bape on january 27 1982 the destruction of the golden bridge over the lempa river in october and other examples of major guerrilla operations in the countryside and cities suggest a new level of confidence combat capability effectiveness and determination on the part of the armed guerrillas in stark contrast to the lack of such qualities a year ago during the socalled final offensive not only are the guerrillas apparently stronger today than they were a year ago but their effective military reach has expanded no longer is violence limited primarily to rural areas but it has instead spread into the capital and major salvadoran governmental military installations even the secretary of state has acknowledged that an unpredictable environment exists in el salvador today no longer can the administration have the confidence that unitedstates personnel can be safely stationed in areas of security rather there is the increasing prospect that unitedstates personnel may be inadvertently drawn into the crossfire between government and guerrilla forces the guerrillas have also made it abundantly clear in recent weeks that they intend to continue to escalate their violence in an effort to disrupt the elections scheduled for the end of march although the administration assured us a year ago that unitedstates advisers would be limited exclusively to training roles and would in no fashion be involved in combat or operational patrols nor in combat advisory roles it is increasingly unclear where the line between training and implicit us involvement in the actual planning and conduct of salvadoran government military operations is drawn the recently publicized film unitedstates personnel armed with m18 rifles suggests first that the administrations commitments to congress that unitedstates personnel would carry only personal sidearms has been violated and second that the level of danger of unitedstates personnel has increased to the point where our advisers themselves feel a compelling need in the interest of selfdefense to carry more than just personal sidearms under such circumstances it is clear that the prospect of american soldiers becoming casualties in the salvadoran war has increased dramatically finally the reporth last week regarding the stationing of a unitedstates navy destroyer off the gulf of fonseca add to the apprehension of many who view the presence of unitedstates warships with unitedstates military personnel on board in an area of tension and hostilities as a risk of potentially great consequences it would appear that the administration is treading dangerously close to the legal borderline and is at a minimum testing the authority of the war powers resolution if the administration believes that it is in the vital interests of the united states to keep or increase unitedstates military personnel in el salvador it should reconsider seriously its obligations to comply with the war powers resolution many observers inside and outside the unitedstates government have already concluded that the sending of unitedstates military advisers has been counterproductive to unitedstates policy interests and find now the difficult question to be one of how the united states can reverse this illadvised policy decision before the consequences of one wrong decision are compounded by the consequences of others accordingly this past week in a series of letters to the president i have proposed that tbe administration accept the offer of president lopez portillo of mexico to use his good offices as an intermediary in seeking political reconciliation in central america as a first step i have urged the president to anrounce that the unitedstates advisers will be withdrawn from el salvador upon the successful completion of the march elections regardless of who wins these advisers have become a symbol of american reliance upon military means of support for a government unable to control the excesses of its own military esthblishment in a situation where the fundamental problems are rooted in poverty illiteracy and social injustice the very presence of american military forcesregardless of whether they are carrying armshas had the unfortunate effect of closely identifying the united states with the human rights violations of the salvadoran military and converting what bevr s an essentially internal conflict i ato an anticolonialist struggle one of the problems of n great power is how to extricate itsulf from an illconsidered policy in vietnam 3he commitment of a small number of troops and the failed polities that followed led to the commitment of greater numbers and to policies that failed to an even greater degree by removing the advisers from el salvador at an early stage president reagan has a unique opportunity to rectify rather than multiply a mistake few american policymakers consider our sending of advisers to have been anything but a mistake not only have the advisers opened the unitedstates to international criticism from friend and foe alike but it is difficult to believe that a contingent of this minimal size could have a significant impact on the ability of salvadoran authorities to cope with insurgency the problem from a policy point of view is how to establish an appropriate quid pro quo for disengagement in the midst of the vietnam conflict henry kissinger proposed a series of very reasonable deescalation measures to the north vietnamese the problem was they were rejected and the nixon administration got locked into escalating a conflict at a time when prudence indicated the reverse course of action while vietnam analogies are not all appropriate the reagan administration would be well advised not to tie as secretary haig has proposed reduction in the number of our advisers to the actions of other states in the region policy options should be controlled in washington and not become subject to the whims of militaristic potentates bent on irrational behavior the objective of unitedstates cooperation with el salvador should be to encourage and facilitate the holding of free elections not to determine the outcome there would seem little reason to maintain military advisers after elections are successfully completed if the moderate forces of president duarte should prevail a good case could be made that having won a mandate in free elections the presence of american military advisers would no longer be needed less direct forms of support and assistance would be sufficient if the extreme right should emerge in power as many now conjecture withdrawal of our advisers would be a desirable means of disassociating the united states from the human rights violations that would likely insue at the same time announcement that a fiee election is our objective and that the advisers would be withdrawn following its successful completion would remove one of the main justifications for the extreme lefts effort to prevent salvadorans from going c the polls at the heart of the problem in central america and the caribbean basin is an assessment of whether problems are essentially rooted in longstanding patterns of injustice as the unitedstates catholic conference asserts or whether fundamentally the dilemma is one of castroite intervention as secretary haig contends if the former view is given greater weight a policy of economic assistance seems most in order if the latter military options come more to the fore conservative advocates of interventionism have a tendency to exaggerate the castroite dimension of the problem and underestimate the potential counterproductive effects of an overt unitedstates response liberal critics of american foreign policy on the other hand have a tendency to be overly generous in their assessments of the ideals and intentions of insurgency movements perhaps the most appropriate perspective is to recognize the social and economic inequities that exist but not to sympathize with the radical alternatives presented the united states has a profound influence over events in the caribbean but that influence is exercisedmost effectively when active american involvement is limited to economic assistance and peace corps kinds of activities military options dont solve social problems on the other hand economic assistance in some circumstances may not be enough but the united states acting alone on behalf of and within the confines of a smaller latin state is likely to exacerbate rather than diminish hostilities strategic options are far better exercised in concert with other latin states and at this time the most hopeful strategic initiative would appear to be the one proposed by mexican president lopez portillo his specific suggestions may be imperfect but the offer of his offices as a neutral intermediary may be the best chance to achieve a reduction in central american tension available president reagan risks a great deal if he too lightly spurns the assistance of our increasingly important neighbor to the south the president also risks support of congress and the american people if he does not comply with the strict provisions

and ranking minority member together with the other members of the subcommittee for the deliberate consideration which has been given to this public broadcasting measure we are facing difficult times in many areas of our economy but i think it is fair to say that in view of those difficult times the subcommittee has done a great silrviee in developing this legislation which deals fairly in my judgment with public broadcasting there have been differences of viewpoint on our subcommitteb and on the committee about the content of this legislation i am generally supportive of the measure because i believe that we have struck the proper balance between the desire to hold down expenditures at the public level while at the same time preserving the important services of public broadcasting i it is very difficult to anticip ate what economic conditions will be like in 1984 1985 and 1986 yet that is what in essence we are asked to do in this legislation because we are making auithorization levels for 1984 1985 and 1986 it is essential that we plan that far in advance in order to retain the independence of the public broadcasting system that method of forward authorization was established for that purpose of maintaining the independence of the system and while it is very good from that standpoint it does make it difficult for those who are trying to make projections into the future because of my confidence in the ability of the subcommittee to turn around under the policies proposed by the administration i have not gone as far as the administration would like in terms of cuts in the authorization levels however i do think it is important to note that we have made very substantial cuts in those authorization levels from 220 million for the oper ation of the public broadcasting system this year down to 160 million in 1984 145 million in 1985 and 130 million in 1986 we have also made cuts in the facilities the telecommunications facilities program moving from 40 million authorization for the current fiscal year to 25 million for the 1982 fiscal year 20 million for the 1983 fiscal year and 15 million for the 1984 fiscal year i am hopeful that these cuts will be considered substantial and adequate by the full house when we are considering this legislation but because we have made substantial cuts in the public broadcasting system funding we are faced with another very serious problem that it how do we keep these stations on the air how do we continue to extend public broadcasting services to the people of our country in order to address that issue the subcommittee has looked at several incomeproducing avenues we have authorized in this legislation the use of logos on public broadcasting in order to encourage corporations and others to provide funds for the operation of public broadcasting facilities and for programing we have also authorized the use of public broadcasting facilities on a rental basis by outsiders who may wish to use those facilities and in that way we hope to generate some income for the public broadcasting system and for the stations i believe however there is one other thing we should do in order to insure the financial stability of public broadcasting in the future when we in the subcommittee considered this issue of providing for the financial stability of public broadcasting in the future we considered the possibility of institutional adverstising as a means of future income for public broadcasting my good friend the gentleman from texas offered an amendment which would have provided for institutional advertising d 1230 in the discussion of that amendment it became clear that we really had very little information on hand that would provide us with the data that we need in order to make a good decision about advertising on public broadcasting we did not know how much revenue it wuuld generate we had no idea what impact it would have on programing we had little idea about what other impact it would have on audience participation and so on so as a result the subcommittee was reluctant to adopt an institutional advertising provision in this legislation what we have done however i think is develop an amendment which i intend to offer which i think has general support in the subcommittee and committee which would provide for an experiment on advertising on public broadcasting stations what we intend to do is allow for an 18month period during which up to 10 public radio licensees and up to 10 public television licensees would have the opportunity to offer advertising during programing on their stations these advertisements could not interrupt regular programs the advertisements would be limited to 2 minutes at any one time the advertisements would have other limitations placed upon them for example there would be no political endorsements permitted through these advertisments after this 18month period the blue ribbon commission that would be established to conduct the experiment would make a report to congress to indicate what the impact had been of advertising on the public broadcasting stations and what the impact had been on the audiences programing and what sources of revenue had come to the station as the result of this experiment with this information i think we would be able to make sound decisions in the future as to the direction we should go on advertising on public broadcasting i can assure my colleagues that i have some of the same concerns and misgivings about advertising on public broadcasting that i am certain many of them do but i think until we conduct a proper experiment in order to determine the impact of advertising on public broadcasting it will be very difficult for us to discuss this issue any more intelligently in the future than we have been able to do so in the past so i urge support for the legislation that is before us and i hope that the house will see fit to endorse the advertising

statement in opposition to the amendment and in support of the purchase of the c5 it seems to me when you have the army the navy and the air force and all the people in our committees that are assigned to this job that make a decision based upon the facts that they have before them and upon information about the needs of our armed services that we should stick with them i rise in opposition to the amendment offered to delete the c5b purchase from the 1983 department of defense authorization the airlift issue at the center of this debate has generated many claims and counterclaims over the virtues and shortcomings of the boeing 747 and the lockheed c5b aircraft although the president the secretary of defense the joint chiefs of staff the service secretaries and the house and senate armed services committees have supported the purchase of 50 new lockheed c5s to improve our overall strategic airlift capability we are now being asked to evaluate the relative performance capabilities of the c5 and the 747 for budgetary reasons i do not disagree that there is a need to cut federal expenditures wherever possible in order to ease the strain n the federal budget but to approve the purchase of an airplane that will cost less at the expense of performance capability is very poor defense planning indeed our defense experts have testified that the c5 is the best possible remedy to alleviate our nearterm airlift shortfall since airlift constitutes such an important part of logistics planning the transport airplane used in the airlift is a major determinant for the efficiency and effectiveness of our airlift missions military experts are telling us that if rendered operational under actual emergency circumstances the more efficient and flexible aircraft for rapid deployment would be the c5 the unique features of which make it the best possible plane to do the job in addition the c5 has been improved to better meet our military needs for todays combat situations proponents of the 747 have told us that 48 747s would be equivalent to 50 c5s will save us 6 billion over the next 20 years and will be available for use 3 years earlier at a glance this option would certainly appear to be the more attractive one however the defense experts in closely examining the boeing proposal have informed us that the boeing facts and figures are misleading enough to warrant a much closer look by this body according to the air force the boeing 747 life cycle cost calculations were not done on the same basis as the air force c5 cost calculations and as such do not provide for a fair comparison of the relative costs involved in fact air force price analysts have refuted the 6 billion savings and documented the difference at less than 1 billion over a full 20year cycle of both planes therefore we are really talking about a 900 million difference over 20 years i believe that cost is an important consideration and we should be circumspect and thorough in this regard but we must not lose sight of the basic and overriding concern at the heart of this issue that of military utility while the boeing 747 may cost less in its present capacity as a commercial passenger aircraft the facts will undeniably change if it is to be adapted for military use even if we did add 48 or 55 modified 747s they still would not meet all of the requirements for our military airlift operations boeings own chairman of the board has publicly stated that boeing is not proposing that the 747 be used to carry outsized equipment keeping this in mind i believe our choice of plane seems clear no one can deny that the 747 is a valuable national asset and with modifications would be useful for some deployment missions however the air force has pointed out that a strong civil reserve air fleet modification program through which existing commercial 747s are already available can provide airlift at oneseventh the cost of air force ownership of these aircraft i appreciate that we are and should be very sensitive to the risks and costs of making and selling airplanes in todays economy procurement of 747s would certainly help those who manufacture the aircraft as well as those airlines from which the surplus aircraft would be bought however tempted we may be to aid our ailing industries can we really justify in todays action on this issue relief for some industries or elements of one industry and not provide relief for others we are faced with a decision that affects the mobility deployment effectiveness and response of unitedstates armed forces i cannot stress strongly enough that we are not going to get a bargain if the product we buy cannot do the complete job the 747 will not adequately meet all of our military cargo transport needs and therefore is not cost effective by any measure in closing i urge my colleagues to carefully consider the real issue underlying this debate and support the armed services committee recommendation to buy the c5b and reject the motion favoring the 747"], [0.9549435004591942, 0.04505649954080582, 1, "i rise in support of the conablehance tax substitute and particularly its provisions encouraging increased personal savings by all americans a brief history of the issue lndicatts the american willingness to save has substantially decreased over the last 10 years by the end of 1978 the rate of disposable income savings in the united states reached a 30year low of under 5 percentfar less than any other western democracy for example great britain has a 13percent savings rate west germany 15 percent and japan 25 percent each of these countries offers generous tax concessions or government bonuses to savers the importance of savings to productivity and our overall economy cannot be overstated onethird of all the capital in this country is made available through personal savings without adequate savings there cannot be sufficient investments in industry small business and home construction the result is higher consumer prices and increased unemploymnent last year recognizing this critical need to stimulate savings the congress enacted two measures that gradually raised the interest a person could receive on his or her savings deposits and allowed 200 400 for couplesof that interest to be taxfree for a 2year experimental period unfortunately while these two landmark laws represented a positive shift in unitedstates economic policy they have not resulted in any noticeable rise in personal savings interest rates on savings deposits have remained close to their original levels and as feared the 200 400 temporary interest tax exclusion does not seem to be enough of an incentive to save in fact studies show that an estimated 95 percent of all the money saved in america is earned by individuals and businesses whose interest and dividends income exceed the 200 400 limit earlier this year i introduced a bill h r 3049 to remedy this situation my legislation would make permanent the current 200 400 tax exclusion on interest and dividends and raise it to 1 000 2 000 for savings interest only in addition my bill would allow all persons age 65 and over to earn taxfree interest on their savings deposits the conablehance substitute offers similar relief aimed at providing a shortterm and much needed boost to our slumping savings and loan and thrift industry under the terms of this legislation depository institutions would be authorized to issue 1year taxexempt savings certificates they would allow single taxpayers to earn as much as 1 000 2 000 for couplesin taxfree interest the certificates which would cost 500 and above would yield 70 percent of the interest rate on 52week treasury bills and would be available for a 15month period beginning on october 1 the certificate would allow depository institutions to retain and attract many of the investment dollars that have recently gone to competing investment opportunities that currently offer higher returns i might add that these pavings certificates are far more prefprable than a proposal that has been offered to lower the returns on competing money market funds rather than penalizing the small saver by eliminating one of their few opportunities to get a fair market return on his or her dollar additional investment opportunities should be made available the taxexempt savings certificates provide such an opportunity as an original member of the house select aging committee i would like to emphasize however that these taxexempt savings certificates are not the final solution to our nations dismal savings rate especially as it relates to the elderly first the certificates would only be offered for a 15month period allowing the troubled depository institutions to revitalize thermselves over a 2year period but falling to provide any longterm relief for either the institutions or the saver second many senior citizens cannot afford to tie up 500 or more of their savings for a 1year period they depend heavily on their savings to pay for daily living expenses including emergency medical needs under the proposed certificate plan a person would receive stiff interest penalties for withdrawing funds early i favor a more flexible savings incentive plan that would incorporate the taxexempt savings certificate idea with the bill i authored providing acrosstheboard taxfree interest for senior citizens unfortunately i am restricted by the rule from offering such a compromise proposal in the form of an amendment as a result i am supporting the taxexempt certificate plan as the most responsible plan under these circumstances and another major step toward permanent and meaningful small saver relief we must not forget however that savings interest represents nearly 25 percent of the total income for persons age 65 and over in additions twothirds of all savings accounts in the united states belong to persons 5 years and older certainly then any longterm small savers relief should address the special needs of our elderly that is why i continue to offer my bill h r 3049 as an effective solution to the savings rate problem in our nation let me finally express my support for the additional savings incentive contained in the substituteincreased retirement investment opportunities under the conablehance amendment the current 1 500 limit on individual retirement account ira contributionrq would be increased to 2 000 2 250 for couples in addition for the first time employees contributing to an employersponsored pension plan could also claim the 2 000 2 250 ira tax deduction in addition the maximum tax deductible contributions to selfemployment keogh retirement plans would double from 7 500 to 15 000 both of these retirement savings in centives are expected to attract millions of new savings dollars while allowing individuals to plan for a more financially secure retirement simply stated increased savings by americans will do as much to stimulate our economy and increase productivity as any other economic tool the conablehance substitute provides responsible and effective tax incentives for savings and i urge that it be adopted today 9"], [0.9539600238204002, 0.04603997617959976, 1, "i take this special order at this time to begin a discussion of the subject of regulatory reform and the entire issue of what has happened to the initiative in this house that was so boldly undertaken many months indeed years ago to get the bureaucracy of the federal government under control and to make it more responsible to the desires and wishes of the american people the reason i take this special order and begin this discussion is that for reasons which are unexplained to me and i think unexplainable the initia tives that have been launched in this direction have ground to a silent and mysterious halt someplace in the halls of this house what is regulatory reform all about mr speaker it is a method a means by which the american people seek to regain control over their own government the fact of the matter is that more decisions are made more rules and regulations are issued by unelected officials affecting the lives and the livelihood of all americans than there are as a result of laws passed by the congress of the united states during the average session of a congress somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 laws are passed during that same period of time almost 20 000 rules and regulations can be passed the ratio of those rules and regulations having the force and effect of law on nonelected officials as compared to those made by those elected by the people of the united states is something to contemplate much of the cynicism that the american people feel about their government is a result of the unaccountability of a bureaucracy that is remote insensitive arbitrary and sometimes yes oppressive it was out of this concern that members of congress both in the house and the other body rose up and said that we are going to change this in a bipartisan way members of my party democrats took the initiative in this effort originally to bring the bureaucracy under control through a streamlining and accountability even through the use of the legislative veto which lets members of the congress elected by accountable to the people have the final say so by reviewing and where necessary rejecting and vetoing regulations issued by unelected bureaucrats in 1975 when that issue of legislative veto first came to the floor of this house for a vote up or down on all agencies that should be covered by it 265 members of this house voted in favor if it since that time for reasons again unexplained and unexplainable there has never been an effort made to get that legislation back to this floor for action even though over a majority of the members of this house of both parties have cosponsored legislation to that effect we have amended pieces of legislation on an itembyitem basis to place this mechanism in effect to get control over these unaccountable bureaucrats and it has had an improving impact on our government recently we added this type of control over the federal trade commission different programs in the environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture but the need to make the entire bureaucracy accountable to the american people still remains in years gone past while the house of representatives has moved forward the other body has been reluctant the other body has been the one that has failed to pass this legislation but this year this year the other body by a unanimous vote adopted legislation providing for regulatory reform including a legislative veto what has happened in this house mr speaker what has happened i think is a shame because it reflects upon the members and the leadership of this house what has happened is that although regulatory reform legislation was reported out of the judiciary committee on february 25 of this year that legislationa major bipartisan effort to return control of the bureaucracy to the american peoplehas not yet been able to be voted on by the members of this house the legislative veto legislation h r 1976 which has over 250 cosponsors well over a majority of the members of this house of both parties has yet to be considered in committee or brought to the floor of this house i think it is regrettable that for reasons that cannot be explained there are those in power in this house who have been unwilling to let the voice of the american people be heard who have been unwilling and refuse to understand the force behind more than a majority of the members of this house seeking to have this opportunity to make the bureaucracy accountable and the cynicism of the american people persists about who runs their governmentis it the elected officials or the unelected bureaucrats then that cynicism is understandable and will grow until the members of this house are given the opportunity to do their will and to express the desires of the american people i think you are going to see more and more fingers pointed at the leadership of this house asking the question why is it that legislation which would require accountability on the part of unelected bureauracts is being locked in a closet pigeonholed and not even given the opportunity for consideration i suggest that there are members of this house who in november when the people get an opportunity to go to the polls and express their concerns about the future of this nation are going to hold the leadership of this house and members of this body accountable for once again frustrating the opportunity and the will and the desire of the american people to be heard on this matter what can be so wrong with a piece of legislation that passed the other body by a unanimous vote by people of both conservative and liberal persuasion by the most conservative senators and by the most liberal senators indeed the senators from your own state the commonwealth of massachusetts supported this legislation as it came through the other body what can be wrong with legislation like that that it is not even possible to let the members of this body speaking on behalf of the american people have that chance to bring accountabflity i do not know what you hear when you go to your district but one of the things that i hear is that the american people are fed up with a bureacracy that will not listen with people who control their lives and livelihood whose names they do not know and if they did could not hold them accountable that is not a phenomenon of this administration or the last administration or the administration before that that is a fact of life about the government we have the american people under our system of government are entitled to look to their elected officials and not be put upon solely by the unelected officials yes there are many indeed most of the people in the civil service of this country are dedicated and reasonable and committed individuals many of whom serve at a sacrifice for the american people and consider themselves public servants but there are others who because of this unaccountability have delegated to themselves decisionmaking powers an imposition on the american people that is unwarranted asi said this is not a liberal or a conservative issue some people have suggested that it is an approach that would favor business as opposed to consumers or environmental groups or public interest groups nothing could be further from the truth it is a twoedged sword the voice of the people can be heard through their elected officials when they cannot even get in the front door of many agencies of government there are many regulations which have been issued by this administration undoing the gains and accomplishments in the field of consumer protection or environmental protection but environmentalists and consumer advocates would have had the opportunity to deal with through regulatory reform and legislative veto just as in other instances the excesses of zealots who have gone too far could have been curbed and restrained and made accountable to the american people where those who did not suffer the inconvenience of running for public office have taken it to themselves to pass rules and regulations affecting every aspect of the life of the american public so therefore i appeal to you i urge you bring this legislation to the floor of this house it would take no more than a word from you for this legislation to come forth and let the members of this house work their will upon it on behalf of the american people failing to do that i fear that many members of this house in the elections that are coming up later this year are going to have to answer to the fact why it was that that which was wanted and desired by the american people control over their own government accountability of the federal bureaucracy was not even given the fair opportunity to be votcd on even through a majority of the members of this house have sponsored legislation to do that that is no way to run a democratic institution and if people have to pay a price for that failure of democracy then it is an appropriate price to be paid the american people want their government to be accountable to them it is indeed a government of the people and by the people and in that way it can be a government for the people therefore i urge you do that which the members of your house the members who elected you speaker of their house have asked for let the regulatory reform legislation and the legislative veto opportunity come to this house so that the members can join with their counterparts in the other body pass this legislation and help restore true democratic principles to our government"], [0.9513982534408569, 0.9513982534408569, 0, "i support the conference report on house joint resolution 325 which makes continuing appropriations for the

year starts at midnight tonight no appropriation bilis have been enacted into law under the ruling of the attorney general and the implementing omb regulations after midnight tonight the only obligations that can be legally incurred absent an enacted appropriation will be for the protection of life and property and for the orderly and prudent termination of government functions this is not the time for individual disagreements it is a time for consensus we must continue government functions at minimum levels and work out individual disagreements on the individual appropriation bills i

emergency ad thority provided by the house with the passage of h r 4119 the agriculture appropriations act for fiscal year 1982 to combat threats from gypsy moths and fruit flys as well as other pests and diseases this authority provides that the secretary can transfer such funds as he deems necessary from other appropriations and funds available to the department of agriculture to meet such emergencies additionally the managers from the senate will move to concur in an amendment to an amendment of the senate to which the house receded in order to make 93 200 000 available for the elderly feeding program authorized by section 311 of the older americans act and to make available 250 000 000 for guaranteed loans under the rural development insurance fund for alcohol production facilities these funds are to be made available in an expeditious manner under a restructuring of this program provided in h r 4119 house conferees receded to am indment no 16 which directs the economic development administration to maintain the number of economic development representatives in the various states at 47 the amendment further directs that where possible the individuals who held those positions on june 1 1981 should retain their jobs the effect of the amendment is to deny a reorganization request from the eda to eliminate these positions in the defense area both defense and military construction are at fiscal 1981 levels and were not conference items mx deplgyment construction and bomber procurement are not allowed to proceed under the 1981 restrictive language which remains in effect for the life of the continuing resolution the conferees agreed to provide 600 000 for the yorktown bicentennial celebration instead of the 750 000 recommended by the senate no funds were included by the house these funds will be used by the department of defense to proceed with plans and implementation of dod participation in this event it was essential that we include the funds here so their plans can proceed rather than awaiting a final defense appropriation in late november or december the report clarifies house language concerning military pay and allowances by stating our intent that overseas costofliving payments be made at the rate which normally would take effect tomorrow to do otherwise would be unfair finally the conferees agreed on report language allowing the secretary of defense to take necessary steps under existing law to correct the wage rate disparity at the national guard group in wichita kans and other trouble areas if he determines such rates are no longer competitive house conferees accepted senate amendment no 44 which provides 125 million for unitedstates participation in the multinational force and observers in the sinai to meet unitedstates commitments under the camp david agreements while these funds have not yet been authorized an appropriation at this time is essential if this multinational force is to be in place by march 20 1982 as specified by the agreements a provision included prevents these funds from being used for the actual participation of unitedstates troops in this multinational force without prior authorization by congress another provision may be added on the house floor whenamendments in technical disagreement are considered which would limit the amount which could be expended prior to authorization to not more than 20 million this conference report provides that the programs of the department of housing and urban development and independent agencies will be continued at the rate

concern that exists regarding the future of the epa wastewater treatment construction grants program because no funds for this program are included in the fiscal year 1982 hud appropriations conference report the conferees have therefore included language in this conference report reaffirming the intention to make an adequate level of funds available for the epa construction grants program in fiscal year 1982 as soon as the congress has completed work on the pending construction grants reform legislation and upon receipt of the promised administration budget request for this program for the department of the interior and related agencies the continuing resolution would continue the activities of these agencies at the current rate or the rate provided in h r 4035 as passed by the house on july 22 whichever is lower the conferees are agreed on the importance of continuing efforts to fill the strategic petroleum reserve but in keeping with the provisions of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 which was adopted after the house had passed the fiscal year 1982 interior appropriations bill the house accepts the senate amendment providing that funds necessary for oil acquisition and transportation costs related to spro shall be carried off budget the continuing resolution provides for the extension of current law concerning abortion essentially that language says none of the funds made available shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term provided however that the several states are and shall remain free not to fund abortions to the extent th at they in their sole discretion deem appropriate the resolution extends the current law language prohibiting prevention of voluntary prayer programs in public schools the joint resolution provides such sums as may be necessary during fiscal year 1982 for closeout expenses of the community services administration the committee intended that these funds also be available to continue to pay career senior executives of the community services administration as required by law until these senior executives are reassigned the house receded to a technical amendment by the senate concerning the provision of impact aid funds the amendment as accepted relieves the secretary from making impact aid pa yments to school districts within 30 days after the beginning of the fiscal year in an amount equal to 75 percent of the amount they received in the previous fiscal year this amendment was accepted because the appropriation for impact aid for fiscal 1982 will be less than 75 percent of the current years level the conferees made clear however that the secretary shall make payments as needed to those school districts heavily dependent upon impact aid for maintenance and operations of local schools the conferees included in the statement of the managers language that indicated that it is the understanding of the conferees that the resolution contains sufficient funds and authority to operate the office of adolescent pregnancy for the duration of the resolution to maintain the option for congress to consider future funding for the adolescent family life program there is no statement in the conference agreement concerning the public health service hospitals under the rate of operations prescribed by the resolution the secretary would have 25 million available for conversion activities for those hospitals whose conversion plans are approved chairman natcher and senator schmitt agreed during the conference to write the secretary a letter indicating that he should maintain as much flexibility as possible in funding and approving conversion proposals since more funds for conversion might be forthcoming in the fiscal 1982 appropriations bill in regard to pay and related issues the senate rcceded on an amendment no 13 which had proposed a relaxation of the federal pay cap in the house bill to the extent that increases would have been allowed for executive levels iii iv and v the effect of the conferees action is to extend the pay cap for members of congress high executive branch officials and the judiciary through november 20 1981 house conferees receded to the senate on amendment no 35 which eliminates the 25 000 ceiling on honoraria which can be received in any year by federal employees including members of the unitedstates senate house members are limited to 15 percent of congressional salary for such income amendment no 38 also includes language providing a permanent appropriation in future years for ~compensation of members as authorized by law at levels recommended by the president for other federal employees the conferees also agreed to remove the statutory 3 000 limit on living expenses which can be deducted from federal taxes by members of congress while away from home amendment no 46 states that it is the sense of congress that limits on such deductions should be the same as the limits for businessmen and other private citizens on the issue oi the report language which relates to amtrak rail service i must say that i am dismayed with the decision to extend special treatment to the cardinal train this train represents the most political route in the amtrak system it has failed consistently to attain the congressionally required criteria for longhaul trains yet it remains in service for a select few a recent amtrak management recommendation to the amtrak board of directors indicates that this route again fails to meet the performance criteria that we had estatiished in this congress after a great deal of debate in fact the route is projected to attain only 122 passengermiles per trainmile figure the requirement for continuation of this line has been decided by the congress to be no less than 150 the report states it is therefore our judgment that the cardinal should be discontinued it is ludicrous to offer special treatment to this poor performance train at the expense of superior train routes which can better serve the publics traveling needs i am pleased to report that there is no language in this resolution which precludes the secretary of transportation from implementing the washington national airport policy plan the resolution offers the secretary the necessary flexibility regarding implementation as many of you are aware the plan is designed to assure the maximum safety of air operations in the washington area reduce noise and congestion at national airport and encourage the
