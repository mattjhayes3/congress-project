with those of us who are interested in healthy food my amendment would fund and seek to have the secretary of agriculture focus on the healthy food funding initiative this initiative would increase the availability of affordable healthy foods in underserved urban and rural areas and as well particularly through the development or equipping of grocery stores and other healthy food retailers we call these food deserts and the reason why i am standing next to this tragic picture of the disasters that have hit the american public is to emphasize what americans go through in this instance we see a disaster of unbelievable proportion from missouri to alabama to the flooding that occurred up and down the mississippi i can assure you that these individuals are suffering from the lack of access to healthy food weve got to get them back on their feet this idea of food deserts impacts rural and urban areas but it also impacts the millions of americans thousands upon thousands of americans who have recently been impacted by disaster everything is gone and although they are now probably experiencing the distribution of food from food centers sponsored by fema and volunteers they will come back to a food desert particularly in the african american and hispanic communities for example food comes from fast foods and convenience stores and as i indicated before those fast foods come from if you will the places where the expiration dates are sometimes way over the time of expiration according to the centers for disease control and prevention 80 percent of black women and 67 percent of black men are overweight african american children from lowincome families are at a much higher risk for obesity why because there is no access or limited access to good food the cdc also estimates that african american and mexican american adolescents ages 12 to 19 are more likely to be overweight at 21 percent and 23 percent respectively this amount of money will allow us to focus on the importance of correcting food deserts the unitedstates department of agriculture identified 92 food desert census tracks in harris county alone and that is in the 18th congressional district these areas are subdivisions of a county with between 1 000 to 8 000 lowincome residents with 33 percent of the people living more than a mile from a grocery store according to the kaiser family foundation 32 percent of all children in texas are overweight or obese these statistics underscore the staggering effect food deserts have i am asking that we look at the idea of ensuring healthy food targeting federal financial assistance to food desert areas through the healthy food finance initiative will provide more healthy food to affected areas we can create jobs we can help farmers and we can bolster the development in distressed areas it is an easy fix and the fix is to find a way to cooperate collaboratenot do a handout not dole outto make sure that we provide the incentives to come into our areas to ensure that we have a healthy child this is a healthy child we hope getting access to health care but i can assure you that their health is based upon not only health care but the food that this little one will eat i can tell you that i represent communities that have the inability to access good food this initiative will increase the availability of healthy food alternatives to the 23 5 million people living in food deserts nationwide we must be reducing the deficit i agree but cutting programs that provide healthy foodand create jobs because it would certainly create jobs by adding access to healthy food and sites for healthy food meaning grocery stores farmers markets all of those will be part of this initiative and it would assist the many many census tracks in houston alone that are now suffering from the lack of access to good food just a picture of green vegetables inspires us to support this amendment i would ask my colleagues to support this amendment i thank the chairman for this opportunity to explain my amendment to h r 2122 which allocates an additional 25 million to the budget of the office of the secretary in order to fund president obamas healthy food funding initiative hffi funding hffi will increase the availability of affordable healthy foods in underserved urban and rural communities particularly through the development or equipping of grocery stores and other healthy food retailers these food deserts communities in which residents do not have access to affordable and healthy food options disproportionally affect african american and hispanic communities fast food restaurants and convenience stores line the blocks of low income neighborhoods offering few if any healthy options many of my colleagues across the aisle have made arguments about the economic climate and the need for budgetary cuts and i agree that we must work to reduce the deficit we cannot however continue to make irresponsible cuts to programs for the underserved lower income families and minorities since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children and obesity is a grave health concern for all americans however food deserts have taken a toll on low income and minority communities and exacerbated growing obesity rates and health problems according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 80 percent of black women and 67 percent of black men are overweight or obese african american children from low income families have a much higher risk for obesity than those in higher income families the cdc also estimates african american and mexican american adolescents ages 1219 are more likely to be overweight at 21 percent and 23 percent respectively than nonhispanic white adolescents who are 14 percent overweight in children 611 years old 22 percent of mexican american children are overweight compared to 20 percent of african american children and 14 percent of nonhispanic white children food deserts have greatly impacted my constituents in the 18th congressional district and citizens throughout the state of texas texas has fewer grocery stores per capita than any other state the unitedstates department of agriculture usda identified 92 food desert census tracts in harris county alone these areas are subdivisions of the county with between 1 000 to 8 000 lowincome residents with 33 percent of people living more than a mile from a grocery store according to the kaiser family foundation 32 percent of all children in texas are overweight or obese these statistics underscore the staggering effect food deserts have on the health of lowincome and minority communities in houston and other cities across the country local programs have proved that well targeted funding and assistance can create viable business outcomes and increase access to healthy food targeting federal financial assistance to food desert areas through the healthy food funding initiative will provide more healthy food to affected neighborhoods open new markets for farmers create jobs and bolster development in distressed communities the healthy food funding initiative is not a handout or a crutch funding through this program is intended to provide financial and technical assistance in support of market planning promotion efforts infrastructure and operational improvements and increase availability of locally and regionally produced foods this initiative will increase the availability of healthy food alternatives to the 23 5 million people living in food deserts nationwide yes we must work toward reducing the deficit but cutting programs that provide healthy food to those who simply do not have access to nutritional options is not the way with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0005151033401489258, 0.9994848966598511, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i rise in opposition to

have the power to enact this comprehensive plan including its minimum coverage requirement under the commerce necessary and proper and general welfare clauses of article 1 section 8 of the constitution similar attacks were levied against the social security act of 1935 saying it was unconstitutional for the same reasons those arguments were unsound and rejected then and will fare no better today indeed leading republican lawmakers championed individual mandates as part of their health equity and access reform today act of 1993 introduced by senator dole and senator chafee the requirement of individual participation was valid then and it is valid now for all of these reasons i strongly encourage my colleagues to vote no on this misguided repeal bill following is my statement in its entirety i rise in opposition to the republican effort to deny 32 million americans health care to deny millions of middleclass americans the ability to get health care insurance if they have preexisting conditions and to drive up our national debt by an additional 1 4 trillion over the next 20 years last march i had the distinct pleasure and honor of voting for the affordable care act which achieves many of the goals i have been fighting for my entire adult life the affordable care act will stave off the 55 percent of personal bankruptcies caused by health care emergencies by banning rescissions banning the preexisting conditions insurance bar banning annual and lifetime coverage caps and capping annual outofpocket expenses this law ensures that nobody will go broke because they get sick when fully implemented more than 32 million additional americans will have access to health care coverage this translates into saving the lives of the 45 000 americans who now die every year because they lack health insurance in addition the affordable care act extends greater rights and benefits to women no longer can insurance companies discriminate against women by charging women higher rates than men for the same coverage no longer will women be denied coverage because insurance companies consider pregnancy csections and being the victim of domestic violence to be preexisting conditions no longer will women go without critical maternity care coverage access to mammograms and other key preventive care servicesservices that will be available without copays and deductibles ending these routine disgraceful and patently unfair practices are a tremendous victory for women and children for americas seniors the affordable care act strengthens the medicare program seniors will no longer pay out of pocket for preventive services and the cruel donut hole which forces seniors to choose between taking their drugs or going without will be closed and by cracking down on fraud and waste the act ensures that those who seek to take advantage of our seniors and steal from the medicare program will no longer have a free ride the affordable care act also benefits americas young people often without the option of employerbased health insurance young people now can stay on their parents health plans until their 26th birthday and owners of small businesses will get billions of dollars in tax credits to help them provide health coverage to their employeesunless of course the republicans are successful in enacting a massive tax increase on small businesses by repealing this law we did all this and more while reducing the deficit by what cbo now estimates will be 230 billion in the first ten years and 1 2 trillion in the next ten years when our predecessors passed similarly historic laws such as social security in 1935 and medicare and medicaid in 1965 they knew the measures would require further consideration in the years since those crucially important programs were signed into law congress has made and will continue to make improvements to those programs and that is the keyto make improvements to the law instead of spending our time looking for ways to build on and perfect the health care reform law republicans want to take a sledgehammer to it to throw out everything without any consideration at all no matter that our economy still needs our attention no matter that millions of americans remain out of work the republicans say the bill is an unprecedented or unconstitutional expansion of congressional power they are wrong there is nothing radical dangerous or unconstitutional about the act through which congress is regulating the vast interstate health and insurance markets in a number of ways that protect the american people

come to the floor of the house of representatives this afternoon to join some of my colleagues on the democratic side of the budget committee to talk about choices you know government is all about choosing it is setting priorities and it is choosing what we are going to spend the peoples money for how much we are going to ask the people to pay to the government and how we are going to spend those dollars it is all about choosing it is also about values this week this issue of choices is playing itself out in two arenas in government one in the continuing resolution battle that took place on this floor this afternoon the idea that we have to figure out how to fund the government for the rest of this fiscal year ending september 30 and whether or not we are willing to let the government shut down tomorrow night because of the choices that we either make or refuse to make and it is also playing itself out now in the development of the budget for the following fiscal year yesterday in the budget committee we considered the budget proposal offered by chairman ryan and the republicans that offered some very stark choices for the american people they are similar to the choices that we have been debating week after week after week for the last couple of months about how we are going to fund the government for the rest of the year from the democratic perspective at least i know from my perspective the reason i have not been willing to support the republican versions of the continuing resolutions that have come to this floor is that they make choices which dont seem very fair to me they dont seem to represent the values that this country has always embraced the values of fairness and justice and the idea that we are all in this great journey together and that we are trying to create a country that works for everybody and not just for a very few today the republicans brought to the floor a continuing resolution to fund the government for one more week these are the choices they made as to what we should cut in order to avoid shutting the government down they wanted to eliminate 143 million for school lunch assistance programs 187 million for education for the disadvantaged programs school improvement funds education innovative improvement programs and adult education it cuts the wic program nutrition for lowincome families women and their children the office of national drug control policy they want to cut 495 million from femas first responder program all these things they wanted to cut and yet when you ask them whether they want to have other people the wealthiest people the big corporations the people who have done very well in this country over the last couple of decades if you ask them why dont we make them share some of the burden of balancing this budget they say oh no we cant do that we cant do that let me just illustrate with this chart one of the choices that they made in the 2012 budget proposal they chose to include refused to eliminate 800 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans and instead cut 771 billion from medicaid over the next 10 years this was a choice do we want to make sure that our senior citizens have access to nursing homes that our disabled population has access to assisted living facilities and home care our young lowincome poor families do we want to make sure that they have health care or do we want to make sure that the wealthiest 2 percent of americans continue to have their cake and eat it too their choice in the budget and in the continuing resolution is to let those wealthiest americans have their cake and eat it too and let the most vulnerable segments of society pay the price of helping to balance the budget i am a big fan of political cartoons and todays cartoon in the washington post i think said it all because one of the other proposals that the republicans made in their 2012 budget proposal was not just to maintain the tax breaks for the wealthiest americans but to increase them they want to cut the maximum tax rate from 35 percent which was the rate that it was cut to by the bush administration they wanted to cut it even further to 25 percent in other words a 10 percent additional tax cut for the wealthiest americans as a matter of fact i offered an amendment in the hearing to rescind the bush tax cut for only those people making over 1 million a year only those people making over 1 million a year they voted it down unanimously but here is the cartoon by tom toles in the washington post it has and i wont name him but a republican member of the budget committee offering a platter that says more tax cuts for wealthy and the truly rich guy says stop i cant eat another bite and the republican says sorry everybody has to share the pain this is one of the choices we have it is stark again tax cuts for the wealthiest americans or health care education nutrition for the other 90 percent of the american people who have not done so well so as we move through this process of choosing both how we are going to fund the government until september 30 and how were going to fund it into the future the american people need to know whose side the republican majority is on and whose side the democrats are on with that i yield to my colleague a member of the budget committee from new york"], [0.0005187392234802246, 0.9994812607765198, 1, "america has always been a nation of diverse cultures but when faced with disasters we come together in recognition of our shared values from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american value i urge my colleagues to reject this ruse to reject the reconciliation process

that were having here right now because the republicans they keep saying to the democrats well whats the plan so we say to the republicans well whats your plan your plan just seems to be saying to grandma and grandpa that theyre taking too much that they reallytheyre taking america for a ride and we have to cut medicare their health care is too good and grandma and grandpa they didnt do enough for america so the democrats we turn around and say hey how about looking at it this way how about before you go after grandma and her medicare card and how about you say to warren buffet hey how about not taking those extra tax breaks and the republicans say we cant take away any tax breaks from warren buffet and all of the other multimultimillionaires and billionaires because theyve contributed so much to america we dont want to touch their money even though that would give us hundreds of billions of dollars and then we say to them well how about prescription drugs how about we negotiate the price for prescription drugs for medicare the way we do with the va that would save about a quarter of a trillion dollars over a 10year period they say that would be unfair to the drug companies we cant touch them either then we say to them well you know the war in iraq the war in afghanistan its winding down now maybe we could look into the defense budget and save a few billion dollars there before we ask grandma to sacrifice on the health care that she gets from medicare and the republicans say we cant do that either we cant look at any cuts in the defense budget that would be much too hard on those defense contractors so then we say to them how about the oil industry at least the oil industry the 40 billion in tax breaks which theyre going to get over the next 10 years i mean does anyone in america really believe that they need tax breaks in order to have an incentive to go out and drill for oil when people are paying 3 3 50 4 a gallon at the pump but the republicans say no you cant touch the oil companies either youve got to give big tax breaks to the oil industry as well even as theyre tipping grandma and grandpa upside down at the pump when theyre coming in to put in their unleaded 4 a gallon gasolineselfserve by the wayat the pump so what do they do instead what they do is they put an oil rig on top of the medicare card so that the oil industry can drill into grandmas medicare and pull out the funding in order to provide the tax breaks for big oil for warren buffet for the prescription drug industry for the wars in iraq and afghanistan its all off of grandma shes the one weve targeted the person responsible for all of the wasteful spending in the united states its all grandmas fault lets cut medicare she didnt do enough to build our country through the 1930s the 1940s the 1950s and the 1960s its all on grandma so this drill rig that they are building into the pocketbooks of grandma in order to find that funding thats what their plan is all about its an oil pipeline into the pocketbooks of the seniors they want to cut checkups for grandma while they cut checks for the oil companies they want to cut health care to grandma and give wealth care to big oil companies and to billionaires and to prescription drug companies their plan is big tax breaks for big oil and tough breaks for grandma and for the seniors in our country and the ceo of chevron he says its unamerican to think about increasing taxes on the oil industry you know what i say to him its unbelievable that you could make that argument but even more unbelievable that the republican party would accept that argument and cut medicare for grandma to privatize it to hand it over to the insurance industry to increase the cost by 6 000 per year for their costs even as they say to warren buffet the oil companies the big drug companies the arms contractors dont worry were going to protect your programs its just grandma thats on the cutting block so ladies and gentlemen this is a debate of historical dimensions and until the republicans come forward with a planwhich they dont have in order to make medicare solventby raising the revenues out of these other areas from millionaires from the oil industry and from others do not expect us to say to grandma its her fault its not her fault she built this country she deserves this benefit and we should not be cutting it this republican plan to end medicare is just something that wants to turn it over to the insurance industry vote no on the republican plan"], [0.000545203685760498,

children program that provides food for the nations children it provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods nutrition education and health care referrals to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children up to 5 years old we must remember that children have always been the largest category of wic participants of the 8 7 million people who received wic benefits each month in fiscal year 2008 about 4 33 million were children and 2 2 million were infants this bill cuts 650 million out of wic and i am so glad my good friend from georgiaand i appreciate his friendshipjust got up and said the agricultural research service is pretty darn well funded 900 million i am simply asking to address the question of the staggering devastation of malnutrition in our children and i have indicated that when you look at worldwide numbers malnutrition can kill but here in the united states there are children that go to bed hungry there are women that do not eat properly there are babies that do not get nourishment in texas alone between 23 000 and 40 000 people are expected to be dropped from the wic program if the funding is not restored and each and every state in the union is going to receive that kind of devastating impact can you imagine 40 000 women infants and children not being able to eat because we wont restore full funding texas has three of the top 40 districts with the highest national food hardship rates and in the 18th congressional district there are 159 000 food insecure people the food insecurity rate is 23 percent and texas stands 32 in the nation out of 435 districts we are 32 in food insecurity so let me just say alongside of obesity eating wrong we have to face the actual question of hunger children who are served by the wic program in texas are less likely to eat fast food in comparison to children who are not in this program again i want you to look at this picture healthy children need to eat healthy and i ask my colleagues why in fact would we not want to fully fund the program of women and infant children i will say that the impact of not eating healthy is obesity and poor health this healthy baby healthylooking baby has a future that is undetermined when you have an issue of lack of healthy food and access to such so 650 million when were in essence funding research for 900 million i believe you can share a little because the wic program is beneficial in helping the most vulnerable in our country i ask the question who will speak for the children it is important that the wic program 9 2 million through 10 000 clinics among this group 4 9 million children 2 1 million infants and 1 million women have the ability to be served around the nation its a complementary program having healthy mothers healthy pregnant mothers to give birth to healthy babies to raise healthy children not obese nourished and ready to be leaders in this nation who are we if we are not going to speak for our children and i ask my colleagues to consider waiving procedural issues to ensure that children are served i believe that is an important issue and in my district in the 18th congressional district with 1 000 census tracts of people who are food insecure i am arguing vigorously for the full funding of the wic program to help our women our infants and their children who will speak for our children what will their future be and how will they lead this country if we do not invest with them today i ask my colleagues to support this amendment i rise today in support of my amendment to h r 2112 agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies appropriations act 2112 as it restores full funding to the women infant and children wic program as the founder of the childrens caucus and a member of the womens caucus i have firmly stood in support of the nutritional needs of our nations families as a country we must protect and safeguard the health and nutrition of our nations lowincome families women infant and children wic provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods nutrition education and health care referrals to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children up to age 5 who are found to be at nutritional risk during the final quarter of fiscal year 2009 the number of women infants and children receiving wic benefits each month reached approximately 9 3 million we must remember that children have always been the largest category of wic participants of the 8 7 million people who received wic benefits each month in fiscal year 2008 about 4 33 million were children and 2 22 million were infants wic is essential because it affords many women especially women of color in lower income brackets the opportunity to care for themselves and their newborns after birth without programs such as wic many mothers would not be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancies and after childbirth because of wic mothers can afford the nutritional foods they need to sustain their pregnancies and avoid miscarriages stillbirths and defects caused by malnourishment during pregnancy today i am proud to support a full restoration of funding to wic this program which is distinctly american demonstrates that we place a high value on feeding our nations children and tending to the needs of our nations poor thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence that we are endowed with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed i believe that it is no coincidence that life is listed firstfor without it the founders realized no other rights can be realized over many years the millions of americans who could not access medical services were denied their right to lifea life with access to quality and affordable health care let me set the record straight wic is good for the american people and will go a long way in ensuring access to quality and affordable care to those millions of americans who will need access to proper nutrition wic helps to ensure that our country will not succumb to one of the most staggering causes of death in children around the world malnutrition malnutrition remains a significant problem worldwide particularly among children it should not be a problem within the united states that is why we have programs like wic according to the united nations world food programme severe acute malnutrition affects an estimated 20 million children under the age of five worldwide and is responsible in whole or in part for more than half of all deaths of children malnutrition kills approximately one million children each year or an average of one every thirty seconds this is not the direction we want to take the united states when i stand here today and reflect upon what we are about to embark upon i cannot help but think of some of the last words that the great senator ted kennedy shared in his letter to president obama the senator said and so because of your obamas vision and resolve i came to believe that soon very soon affordable health coverage will be available to all in an america where the state of a familys health will never again depend on the amount of a familys wealth and while i will not see the victory i was able to look forward and know that we willyes we willfulfill the promise of health care in america as a right and not a privilege well senator your lifes work shall today be proven to not be in vain i continue to stand by protecting the health needs of low income families and yes this program ensures the health of infants and children will never again depend on the amount of their familys income in the words of the great president john f kennedy the voters selected us in short because they had confidence in our judgment and our ability to exercise that judgment from a position where we could determine what were their own best interests as a part of the nations interest while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to believe that without a cut to wic this will harm americans nothing could be further from the truth this bill is indeed in their best interests there are 110 million schoolaged children suffering from hunger every day and they are counting on americas leadership and generosity to provide them with an opportunity to break the cycle of poverty the wic program provides that leadership and generosity and it is for this reason that i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for restoring full funding to wic in the words of the great civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now we cannot wait we will not wait to protect the lives of our children we can not delay in providing the most vulnerable

american innovation and jeopardizes investments in rebuilding america creating jobs protecting the middle class and reducing the deficit are indeed my top priorities we should be working together to accomplish these very valid goals however republicans have controlled this house for 41 days nearly 2 months and brought up zero bills to create jobs the mindless cuts that are on this floor today mean 1 million jobs cut 1 million jobs cut from our economyno jobs for nurses no jobs for teachers no jobs for police no jobs for firefighters no jobs for manufacturing no jobs for small businesses you cut the deficit by putting america back to work not by cutting social security republicans aim to cut social security and medicare when republicans say they are cutting costs they mean cutting social security medicare and medicaid until they dont exist ask my seniors in the 21st congressional district of new york and theyll tell you to leave alone the social security system that has served them well republicans want to make you pay make you pay for big oils billiondollar subsidies make you pay for higher drug prices make you pay taxes to start a small business make you pay for ceo salaries let main street take a hit while wall street gets a bonus the american people want republican leaders to look out for constituents first not their corporate friends this careless resolution cuts jobs and damages our economy just 6 weeks after taking charge of the house republicans are not just ignoring jobs they are cutting them and they admit it this morning our speaker speaker boehner had a response to our concern that this bill destroysdestroysamerican jobs and he said so be it well i guess that he meant so be it if there are 1 300 fewer cops on the beat because this bill terminates the cops hiring program so be it if there are 2 400 fewer firefighters on the job protecting their communities because this bill eliminates funding for safer grants so be it if there are 20 000 fewer researchers at the national science foundation so be it if there are 25 000 lost construction jobs and 76 construction projects are canceled in 40 states so be it if there are 200 000 children kicked out of head start programs and so be it if thousands of teachers will lose their jobs so be it isnt a good enough answer for the hardworking middle class of our country i agree with the president that we must outinnovate outeducate and outbuild the rest of the world we will continue to measure every effort by whether it creates jobs strengthens the middle class and reduces the deficit i have submitted eight amendments to this irresponsible republican spending bill to protect and grow jobs outinnovate other countries in clean energy protect our seniors and ensure quality education for our children i support efforts to balance the budget however i will not support a spending bill that threatens our economic recovery that cuts 1 million jobs just after we have created 1 2 million private sector jobs since last march and is achieved on the backs of senior citizens children and the working middle class republicans have gone too far sacrificing americans health safety and future in order to protect their special interests while offering no real plan to create jobs the american people are united and they are saying one thing show us the jobs i urge defeat of this bill i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0005793571472167969, 0.9994206428527832, 1, "i rise today in strong opposition to the republican spending bill currently before this house this bill fails to create jobs deeply hurts our families and seniors and responds with extremes at a time when our fragile economy can least afford it i am committed to a budget that lives within our means while investing in the future and cutting our deficit however this irresponsible republican spending bill hampers job creation and jeopardizes investments in american innovation american education and american infrastructure that is why president obama vowed today to veto the irresponsible republican spending bill because it undermines critical priorities for national security and curtails the drivers of longterm economic growth and job creation we must do more to focus on jobs grow the economy and protect our middle class certainly while responsibly tackling our nations debt and deficit that is why ive offered 8 amendments to this bill which will protect seniors protect energy innovation strengthen our childrens education and most importantly will protect and grow jobs as the fragile economy slowly recovers we simply cannot afford to pull the rug out from underneath progress not now not when we are finally rebounding from the bush recession not with the extreme spending bill this represents i refuse to take america back to the failed policies that sunk our economy my first two amendments would restore funding from the cuts to the social security administration to prevent its shutdown the cuts that the irresponsible republican spending bill propose in this section alone would raid 625 million from the social security administration this would affect the 53 million americans who are collecting social security by furloughing every employee and closing the doors for a month or more an estimated 400 000 people mostly seniors would not have their claims processed this year creating a huge backlog and threatening the timely payment of benefits my amendments would restore this funding because i do not believe we should use our nations seniors that have worked hard and played by the rules their whole lives to somehow painfully balance our budget this is simply extreme and again painfully irresponsible the low income home energy assistance program or liheap is also cut in this irresponsible republican spending plan by some nearly 400 million those are cuts that are made on the backs of the lowincome residents seniors the disabled and those with children like those i represent in the now cold and snowy capital region of new york who struggle to pay to keep the thermostat set at a livable level liheap keeps those receiving help from having to make the heartbreaking decision about whether to pay to keep the heat on or to pay for food and prescription drugs to pull the rug out from underneath our nations most vulnerable is both simply extreme and painfully irresponsible my fourth amendment would maintain funding for the weatherization assistance program and the state energy program it is amendment number 4 and is set up for a recorded vote today i encourage my colleagues to support this bill the state energy program yields 7 22 in annual energy savings for every 1 invested in it while renovating our 13 000 buildings per year the weatherization assistance program helps lowincome and elderly save over 437 on their annual utility bill and decreases oil consumption by the equivalent of 24 1 million barrels annually to cut these jobsproducing energy savings programs that clearly work is both simply extreme and painfully irresponsible i have also offered two amendments that would protect the clean air act and clean water act from being jeopardized under the irresponsible republican spending plan the clean air act protects public health and safety and has saved hundreds of thousands of lives since 1970 by reducing air pollution by 60 percent while the economy has grown by 200 percent the clean water act protects drinking water for 117 million americans and safeguards 20 million acres of wetlands and wildlife habitats from big polluters seeking to inappropriately legislate against these programs in a spending bill the continuing resolution would threaten the air our children breathe and the water we drink this is simply extreme and painfully irresponsible my seventh amendment removes unobligated funding from fossil energy research and development and transfers these funds to the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy this would prioritize our investments from dirty oil and dirty fossil fuel sources of the past to the energy of today and tomorrow clean energy that would create jobs and make us competitive in a global market choosing to go sit out the clean energy race of today for the outdated energy sources of yesterday is simply extreme and painfully irresponsible my eighth amendment would restore funding for education and special ed to ensure our children and the future of our country have the resources they desperately need to compete in a global marketplace for generations to come it prevents thousands of teacher layoffs the irresponsible republican spending bill cuts over 1 25 billion in education funding that goes directly to states at a time when we can least afford it balancing the budget on the backs of our children and their education is simply extreme and painfully irresponsible i strongly oppose the current irresponsible republican spending bill

middle class families all across america are watching very closely as the chart next to me indicates in 67 days the interest rates on the stafford student loan program a loan program which serves over 7 million college students all across america is slated to increase its interest rate from 3 4 percent to 6 8 percent this program which over time today has served roughly about 35 to 40 million americans is a critical component for middle class families to provide affordable higher education which today in the 21st century is almost as important as having a high school education the stafford student loan programs interest rate was cut in 2007 as a result of the passage of the college cost reduction act a measure which cut the rate from 6 8 percent down to 3 4 percent unlike this congress it was a bipartisan effort77 house republicans voted for that measure 35 republican senators voted for that measure george w bush signed it into law president bush to his credit and it provided again great relief for students all across america for an issue which we now know from the federal reserve bank threatens really the financial solvency of americas middle class college student loan debt today now exceeds credit card debt it exceeds car loan debt one of the few safe harbors that exists in the system for students is in fact the stafford student loan program it has great bipartisan genealogy and sources stafford was actually a senator robert stafford from vermont a republican who again believed in education and was somebody who understood that the cost of college and university education is not what it used to be and that we had to give again middle class families better tools to pay for it anyone who has dealt with the private student loan market knows that the rates today are roughly about 9 to 10 percent interest accumulates from the day the loan is taken out if youre a freshman at a 4year university you accumulate interest for the entire time that you are in college using those loans there is no forbearance there is no timeframe in terms of repayment again it is nondischargeable in bankruptcy if a person gets into great financial difficulty the stafford student loan program in contrast has affordable rates3 4 percent there is a forbearance period after a student graduates of 6 months before payments commence and no interest accumulates during the time that the student is actually in college if there are financial problems that occur again there are systems for deferring payments in fact there is an incomebased repayment formula so that no more than 10 percent of your income can be devoted to the repayment of stafford student loans so this is really again a measure which affects a broad swath of america in terms of millions of students millions of families it is really about the only avenue that young people facing the formidable challengealmost like buying a house when you go to college yet we stand here today 67 days away from having these rates increase now for those who have been watching this issue president obama right from that podium at the state of the union address challenged this congress back in january to address this issue to avoid a doubling of interest rates to date the majority party in this house the republican majority has not taken up a single bill even though we hear some nice words on the other side there is no measure with which they have come forward the chairman of the education committee last week was quoted in the new york times as saying that protecting this rate at 3 4 percent was bad policy we have the words of the chairwoman of the house education subcommittee from north carolina who stated on a radio program a couple of weeks ago i have very little tolerance for people who tell me that they graduate with 200 000 of debt or even 80 000 of debt because theres no reason for that i would challenge that member to talk to a new dentist or a new dental student graduating or a nurse anesthetist who was in my office the other day who was carrying over 80 000 in debt the fact of the matter is in terms of trying to get again skills for this the modern american workforce that is a reality that students and families confront day in and day out yet the leadership of the majority of this congress is basically turning its back on the bipartisan tradition of the stafford student loan program with its really pioneering member of the senate robert stafford with the bipartisan support for the college cost reduction act passed with strong bipartisan votes and signed into law by a republican president george bush and basically saying its bad policy and were not going to do it since last weekand again we did one of these special order 1hour sessions with a countdown clocksome things are starting to change yesterday the republican frontrunner effective nominee for president mitt romney during the middle of a press conference finished up turned around was walking away and turned on his heel and said oh by the way i want to say that i support president obamas proposal to block the increase in interest rates of 3 4 percent this is the leader of the republican party nationally there does seem to be some hope now it may be connected to the fact that the president yesterday was at the university of north carolina talking to young people in this country who know exactly what he is talking about in terms of higher education costs and the need to protect affordable loan programs to pay for college later tonight he is going to be at the university of colorado talking to students at colorado about exactly the same issue tomorrow he is going to be at iowa state university there is clearly a bit of politics swirling around here because if you look at mr romneys comments on this issue over the last few months or so he has in fact said exactly the opposite indeed he has come out in support of the ryan budget the republican budget resolution which was passed in this chamber a few weeks ago in that budget resolution that 6 8 rate increase is locked in under the ryan budget plan not only does it lock in the higher cost of the stafford student loan program it cuts the pell grant program thats the other workhorse of economic affordability in this country named after senator claiborne pell of rhode island again it is a grant program that helps the most needy students pay for college its up to 6 000hardly enough to fully pay for most colleges in the country but nonetheless is essential for college students across this country the ryan budget cuts the grant level for the pell program down to 5 000unbelievableat a time when were seeing college student loan debt skyrocket in this country and sadly at a time when americas graduation rate which was number one in the 1980s has now fallen to number 12 for the folks who are listening here today that is a trend of mediocrity for this country that is not a trend of growth that is not a trend of innovation for the future that is a trend which basically says we are basically going to surrender to the forces of mediocrity in this country and that is not acceptable to this country and its certainly not acceptable to all of us as americans and it resonates all across america again i come from the northeast up in connecticut were joined here today by a great congresswoman from the state of texas sheila jackson

americans are still unemployed or underemployed that this congress has not spent every single day of the last year and a half fighting to put people back to work is unconscionable and now instead of fighting for goodpaying american jobs republicans are launching their 31st attempt to repeal the affordable care act first the republicans said the law was unconstitutional the supreme court said they were wrong next republicans said the law was too expensive the congressional budget office said they were wrong now republicans say the law will raise taxes on millions of middle class families the urban institute says they are wrong estimating that a mere 3 percent of americans under 65 will face the choice between purchasing insurance and paying a penalty lets review what the affordable care act actually does we know it extends health insurance to 32 million uninsured americans which will prevent the unnecessary deaths of 45 000 people who die each year because they lack health insurance we know it will enable millions of americans with preexisting medical conditions to get insurance this has gotten publicity also every middle class family today is one cancer diagnosis away from bankruptcy fiftyfive percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused by health care emergencies and 75 percent of these bankruptcies are of people who had health insurance but health insurance that proved inadequate to cover an expensive disease like cancer by preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions and by eliminating the annual and lifetime caps on coverage found in most current policies the affordable care act will guarantee that middle class families will no longer have to fear going broke because of an expensive illness despite all of the benefits of this law republicans have decided the whole law must go fine they want to repeal and replace replace it with what what is the republican plan to stem the everrising cost of health care in this country and to reduce outofpocket health costs what is the republican plan to help millions more americans gain access to health insurance what is the republican plan to end discrimination in the insurance market for women for those with preexisting conditions for those who are sick and going broke with medical bills and those who die because of lack of care there is none the simple truth is that the republicans have no plan i urge my republican colleagues to do something new to try something novel instead of going to their familiar well of electionyear politics and a steady stream of no lets try to work together lets not turn a blind eye on the problem and hope it goes away lets not be indifferent to 45 000 unnecessary deaths of americans every single year i urge my colleagues to vote no on this repeal bill so that we can move on to fighting for american jobs and we can move on to assuring the middle class that they wont go broke because of an expensive illness and to assuring

boehnercould never go against grover norquist the republicans shake in their boots they will not do anything even though the american people by a more than 70 percent majority say people making more than 1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are in this country so that fell apart then we had the gang of 6 senatorsthree republicans three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of poverty no segment of the population is immune from this painful

the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and in addition to what i have already mentioned this thing that they are taking up in the house today cuts off almost 300 000 children from free school lunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops said the republican plan fails a basic moral test this budget sets very clear priorities the problem is what they are taking up in the house sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people a nation does not have to be cruel to be tough so republicans would do well to remember our nation is judged not only by the strength of its military but also by the strength of its values so says general eisenhower and president

is very clear and its not complicated of course we should as soon as we can this suggests that we can leave by the end of the year if we dont well be there for another decade would be my prediction the american people are now with us a group of us here in the congress a bipartisan group for nearly a decade have been talking about this arguing not to expand the war not to be over there not to be in nation building and the american people didnt pay much attention now they are the large majority of the american people now say its time to get out of afghanistan its a fruitless venture too much has been lost the chance of winning since we dont even know what we are going to win doesnt exist so they are tired of it financially theres a good reason to come home as well some argue we have to be there because if we leave under these circumstances well lose face it will look embarrassing to leave so how many more men and women have to die how many more dollars have to be spent to save face that is one of the worst arguments possible we are not there under legal conditions this is a war who says it isnt a war everybody talks about the afghan war was the war declared of course not it wasnt declared there was a resolution passed that said that the president at that time under the emergency of 9 11 could go and deal with al qaeda those who brought upon the 9 11 bombings but al qaeda is not there anymore so we are fighting the taliban the taliban used to be our allies at one time when the soviets were there the talibans main goal is to keep the foreign occupation out they want foreigners out of their country they are not al qaeda yet most americansmaybe less so now but the argument here on the floor is we have got to go after al qaeda this is not a war against al qaeda if anything it gives the incentive for al qaeda to grow in numbers rather than dealing with them the money issue we are talking about a lot of money how much do we spend a year probably about 130 billion up to 1 trillion now in this past decade later on in the day we are going to have two votes we are going to have a vote on doing something sensible making sense out of our foreign policy bringing our troops home and saving hundreds of billions of dollars then we also will have a vote against npr to cut the funding of npr there is a serious question about whether that will even cut one penny but at least the fiscal conservatives are going to be overwhelmingly in support of slashing npr and then go home and brag about how they are such great fiscal conservatives and the very most they might save is 10 million and thats their claim to fame for slashing the budget at the same time they wont consider for a minute cutting a real significant amount of money all empires end for fiscal reasons because they spread themselves too far around the world and thats what we are facing we are in the midst of a military conflict that is contributing to this inevitable crisis and its financial and you would think there would be a message there how did the soviets come down by doing the very same thing that were doing perpetual occupation of a country we dont need to be occupying afghanistan or any other country we dont even need to be considering going into libya or anywhere else fortunately i guess for those of us who would like to see less of this killing we will have to quit because we wont be able to afford it the process that we are going through is following the war powers resolution this is a proper procedure it calls attention to how we slip into these wars i have always claimed that its the way we get into the wars that is the problem if we would be precise and only go to war with a declaration of war with the people behind us knowing who the enemy is and fight win and get it over with that would be more legitimate they dont do it now because the american people wouldnt support it nobody is going to declare war against afghanistan or iraq or libya we now have been so

it is in arizona but here is a map of arizona and the portions of arizona where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans

simply delays allowing for outsourcing to come back in and be part of the benefits that it provides to this nation reducing cost streamlining the process so again this is already in law as i said this

inspection program here are some of the concerns raised at the hearing most surface inspectors have no surface transportation experience or surface security background whatsoever many surface inspectors were promoted from screening passengers at airports these inspectors report to the federal security directors at local airports who commonly also do not possess any surface transportation experience at least one local tsa official indicated he is always looking for things for his inspectors to do to occupy their time most surface inspectors have two things to look for in a typical day whether a transit system is reporting incidents to the tsa and a box is checked on their clipboard and whether there is a security person on duty another box to be checked on a clipboard the work of these inspectors is redundant performed by employees of other agencies such as the department of transportation osha or epa and on and on what they do is ultimately slow down commerce on our nations rails and highways since 2008 tsa has more than doubled the size of the transportation inspection workforce and quadrupled the programs budget yet according to the majority of stakeholders we heard from there has been almost no tangible improvement in security as a result of these investments last year tsas entire surface transportation security budget was 126 million of this amount surface inspectors cost taxpayers 54 million which does not even include headquarters administration oversight and staff associated with the program this means that the surface transportation inspection program which has been labeled as ineffective by a number of freight rail passenger service bus and mass transit agencies is consuming more than 40 percent of the entire surface transportation security budget millions of americans rely on surface transportation every day more than 8 million people use public transportation in new york city alone despite this need less than 2 percent of the tsas nearly 8 billion budget goes toward securing our nations surface transportation systems and a large portion of that limited budget is being squandered on this ineffective inspection program surface transportation security is too important to our national economy and receives too small a portion of homeland security funding to waste a single dollar opponents of this amendment may argue that it will result in federal inspectors being put out of work it will not we are transferring money to implement more productive security measures within tsa the question is simply why should taxpayers especially those who rely on surface transportation every day have to fund a program that has no proven ability to enhance security my amendment today seeks to limit the inspector program budget to 20 million which would substantially reduce its size and allow the saved money to be put forward in other more effective surface programs such as canine detection units particularly at bus

weapons permits issued by other states this very simple measure has unleashed a firestorm of protests from the political left i noted one polemicist who obviously has not read the constitution wax eloquently of the constitutional violation of states rights enshrined in the 10th amendment what nonsense article iv of the constitution could not possibly be more clear full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof it is precisely this article that requires one state to recognize drivers licenses or birth certificates or arrest warrants issued by another state without it we are not a union but merely a loose confederation well then were told this is dangerous and risky to allow honest and lawabiding citizens to exercise their lawfully issued permits in other states upon what basis do they make this claim certainly not upon any empirical data the impact of righttocarry laws that is laws that require the issuance of a concealed weapon permit to any lawabiding citizen has been studied extensively and the vast preponderance find that crime rates have fallen in those states after theyve adopted such laws no credible study has ever found that the enactment of such laws has produced an increase in crimes or suicides or accidental deaths overall states with righttocarry laws have 22 percent lower violent crime rates 30 percent lower murder rates 46 percent lower robbery rates and 12 percent lower aggravated assault rates as compared to the rest of the country indeed righttocarry laws have been so successful that no state has ever rescinded one so if the left cant make a rational case on constitutional grounds or on empirical grounds what is the problem i suspect it comes down to what ronald reagan once called this irreconcilable conflict between those who believe in the sanctity of individual freedom and those who believe in the supremacy of the state years ago i had the honor to work for the legendary chief of the los angeles police department ed davis during his 81 2 years as chief of the lapd crime dropped in los angeles even while during the same period across the rest of the nation it was ballooning by more than 50 percent chief davis founded neighborhood watch he was an ardent opponent of laws that restrict ownership of firearms by honest citizens his successful philosophy was predicated on the principle that as he put it its not the responsibility of the police department to enforce the law that is the job of every citizen the police department is there to help as citizens were an integral part of the laws that we enact that doesnt mean we act as vigilantes but it does mean that each of us has an inalienable right to defend ourselves and our families from violent predators with whatever force is necessary and if we see a child being molested or a woman being robbed or an old man being beaten we have a moral responsibility to intervene to the extent that we can a concealed weapon in the hands of honest and lawabiding citizens makes us all safer simply knowing that there are responsible citizens among us capable of responding with force is itself a powerful deterrent to crime thats the welldocumented experience of every state with a righttocarry law but a society in which honest and lawabiding citizens are disarmed by their government is a society in which the gunman is king this is a truth that ought to be
