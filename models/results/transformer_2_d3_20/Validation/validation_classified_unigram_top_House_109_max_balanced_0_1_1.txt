border breeds more lawlessness in the united states and failure to protect our borders is a national security issue and i come to you tonight with some doturbing news the threat is even more serious than many americans know tucson arizona is 65 miles from mexico i have it here on the map it is shown by the red dot it is the route to two interstates one going north and south and one going east and west just southeast of tucson arizona is the university of arizona technology park on that park which is surrounded by an oldfashioned chain link fence is a technology firm called raytheon raytheon is a defense contractor that makes tomahawk cruise missiles well neighbors in tucson arizona have sent me some pictures of what appears to be illegal entry into the perimeter of this plant here we have the chain link fence this photograph is taken inside the perimeter on these premises 400 acres is the raytheon plant it is true there is another fence around raytheon that is a fence that is a cable type fence that keeps trucks from coming through but someone of course could crawl underneath or over that particular fence and you see there is all types of litter inside the fence and the question occurs where does this come from these are trails that are similar to what you see along the texas border where i am from but border towns down in southeast texas dont have a plant that makes tomahawk cruise missiles tucson neighbors say these trails are filled with trash backpacks water bottles and clothes and why is that well it seems that the illegals that come from mexico sneak under this fence and hide on these 400 acres until the human smugglers come back later and pick them up and transport them throughout the united states raytheon public relations officials have said well they hadnt heard anything about it from the security and they have strict security procedures to enter that facility but a supervisor at raytheon security said yes illegals have been known to come through the grounds but they were just passing through and some illegals have been found working at the raytheon plant by subcontractors but they were ordered off the premises i would like to show you some more disturbing photographs that the tucson neighbors have sent me this is a photograph taken inside the perimeter of the chain link fence and you see numerous backpacks where illegals have come in to the perimeter have hidden on the premises when the human smugglers come to pick them up and take them into the heartland of america they bring with them the backpacks that allow them to change clothes it is somewhat disturbing to me that we have this contractor that makes tomahawk missiles that allows this to occur on their premises because you see lawlessness on the border breeds more lawlessness in the united states and you would think that a company that has submitted a border security plan for the department of homeland security just 2 weeks ago would be concerned about their bordertoo after all it is a national security issue i have one more photograph to show you taken on the same premises but on the other end of the perimeter a similar photograph of backpacks water bottles left by the people that illegally entered the united states how ironic that it is that they hide on the premises of a place and an institution that is trying to protect the national security of the united states the raytheon problems are our problems because the unitedstates mexico border is not secure we have to stop the illegal entry at the border between the united states and mexico otherwise we will continue to see these backpacks throughout the united states and some may have clothes but some may also bring in to the united states property and explosives that could damage the united states it is a national security issue it is a border security issue we have an obligation to the american people and have to have the moral will to protect the borders and the dignity of the united states and

good friends from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the

power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the

people about many of the issues that we fight for for them here in this unitedstates house of representatives i must say that there are a number of things that we can talk about this evening but i just want to start off because i know that not only the democratic leader but also the entire democratic caucus is looking to hopefully put america in a new direction we want to make sure that we provide the leadership on behalf of all americans as you know i want to start off tonight but as you know we have been sharing it with the members so that hopefully it will have some sort of lift here in the house it has not had thus far but weare willing to provide the leadership even in the minority even though the majority is not willing to pick up the philosophy that we are pushing here on behalf of the american people making sure that we have more affordable health care this is on housedemocrats gov also lower gas prices to achieve energy independence which we have our energy plan on housedemocrats gov and our innovation plan that has been there for some time and filed legislation here in the house that has not been heard we want to talk about homeland security we have a real security plan also on that website that is there for the members they have to have the will and the desire to be able to take up these plans and these initiatives and if we were able to work in a bipartisan way these plans would already be passed not only in the appropriations act but also here on the floor the two other things that i want to mention as it relates to cutting the cost of college cost as you know the cost to go to college has gone up this republicanled congress last not helped in that area they have not helped the everyday average american to be able to meet the increases that they have been asked to pay and also in a new direction for america is making sure that we follow through with fiscal responsibility pay as we go not just on a credit card not just saying because we can give tax cuts to millionaires and we will just puv it off on future generations or we will go to foreign nations and borrow a record number of dollars these nations that i am holding up here they own a part of the american apple pie not because of what the american people have done it is what the republican congress has done and allow these countries to buy our debt because we are not fiscally responsible i think it is also important to make sure that we encourage working families people that are making minimum wage i just want to make this point then i am going to give it to my friend mr ryan from youngstown ohio as you know we have had time after time again three or four occasions in the 109th congress that we have asked the republican majority to join us in raising the minimum wage to make sure that the american workers are able to keep up with the costs of not only living but inflation but it has been well said and mr ryan will point it out with his chart that he has there in a moment that the republican congress is in no way and in no shape ready to give minimum wage workers an increase since 1997 they have not had an increase but here in the 30something working group we actuallytake time to find out the facts because we want to make sure that we are not telling the american people nor members of this house something that is inaccurate i must say that in 1998 members of congress received 3 100 in a pay increase and we are not minimumwage workers in 1998 minimum wage workers zero mr ryan in 2000 members of congress received a pay increase of 4 600 guess what same year minimumwage workers zero 2001 members of congress received 3 800 minimumwage workers zero in 2002 members of congress received another pay increase 4 900 almost 5 000 pay increase remember we just got one in 2002 i was not a member yet but it happened minimumwage workers zero 2003 members of congress 4 700 pay increase just got one last year getting another one in 2003 of course minimumwage workers zero punch in and punch out every day they work a 40hour work week catch the early bus trying to raise their children members of congress 2004 3 400 pay increase same year minimumwage workers zero mr ryan thanks to the republican majority 2005 it is great to be in congress too bad every american cannot be and minimumwage workers cannot be 2005 members of congress 4 000 tell you the republican majority takes care of their own and us too 2005 zero for minimumwage workers proposed increase for members of congress 3 100 and of course this year again

democratic caucus an hour ago we were talking about the issues of fiscal responsibility we were talking about trying to make sure that the american taxpayer gets what tfiey deserve out of this government this government that they have elected to cometo washington d c to represent them to make sure that they get the biggest bang for their tax dollar i think it is important to point out that we are having some real financial issues right now some may say on the majority side ahid i do respect the members on the majority side and i know that there are a few members on the majority side that feel the way we feel here on the minority side on the democratic side of the aisle that we have to get our fiscal house in order and we are not there yet i can say here boldly and honestly that we are not there there are a number of thirdparty validators that are talking about the fiscal irresponsibility on the majority side and by this president that has put this country in financial jeopardy you have individuals saying we want to cut the deficit in half but meanwhile back at the ranch they want to borrow from countries like china they want to borrow from countries like saudi arabia and give those countries a piece of the american pie i think it is important that in the last hour when we talked about innovation we talked about putting america first we talked about not cutting student loans to everyday americans we talked about assisting that next generation and the generations that we expect to be able to stand up and make this and continue to make this country free and put us ahead as it relates to inventions as it relates to innovation we are talking about on this side of the aisle that we embrace and we appreciate our troops and our veterans but meanwhile in the presidents budget it talks about cuts in veterans affairs it talks about higher copayments for veterans i must say i am a democrat but guess what i represent republicans indepenlents green party and democrats back in my district and they feel the way that i do r have not had one constituent say congressman i want you to go to washington d c and make sure that you borpow as much money as possible so that i can pay it back with interest congressman i want you to go to washington d c and be irresponsible with my tax dollars and make sure that we do not have accountability as it relates to unbid contracts congressman i want you to look the other way when it comes down to making surethat you have the proper oversight so that we do not have this culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence that we are seeing on the majority side and in the white house right now i think it is very very important the perception that the american people and the reality that they are seeing right now this is not the kendrick meek or the 30something or the tim ryan report this is what is being printed every day in the papers it is not that the congress is taking a bold step to make sure that the children of america have what they need making sure that we have the kinds of innovation that the president spoke about making sure that the veterans do not have to pay a higher copayment for health insurance that we promised them as a country we salute one flag right now not because of coincidence because individuals have died for that opportunity we have individuals that have served and served in many theaters to make sure that we can salute one flag and the bottom line is we should not turn our backs on those individuals what mr ryan and i are going to talk about in this 30something hour is the tax on corruption the corruption tax that the american people have to pay and the american children have to pay and men and women that have worn a uniform have to pay guess what it is not

vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will help states community colleges and other postsecondary education institutions and local educational agencies to better meet the needs of students participating in career and technical education i urge my colleagues to support this report so we may send this bill to the president for his signature i

the gentlewoman from virginia in suppoyt of this measure i would also like to recognize the gentleman from california for bringing this n~easure forward today on march 6 2006 just a few days ago the united states supreme court affirmed the statutory provision that requires institutions of higher education to provide access to students at least equal in quality and equal in scope to those that are provided to other employers in order to be eligible for receipt of federal funds the statutory provision commonly referred to as the solomon amendment was first enacted in 1994 and has subsequently been amended over the past several years however the basic underlying premise of the provision is that a college or university that denies military recruiters access equal to other recruiters would lose their federal funds the supreme court found that the solomon amendment does not violate the first amendment and that congress can require law schools to provide equal access to military recruiters without violating the schools freedom of speech or association as schools are free to not accept federal funding we are a nation at war and military recruiters need to be able to recruit individuals from all walks of life from the high school graduate to the person completing their doctorate and all of those in between whether they are undergraduates in liberal arts whether they are

bill arrived at after considerable effort of a bipartisan group involving both house and senate judiciary committee staff over several months from hearings in the house and from other reports we have learned that current federal law designed to protect animal enterprises have been proven to be reasonably effective in protecting animal enterprises however serious gaps and loopholes have been identified in current law with respect to protecting employees and associates of animal enterprises present law protects employees of an animal enterprise but we have found that employees board members and family members of businesses and nonprofits affiliated with or doing business with such enterprises are complaining that they are now being stalked harassed intimidated or threatened with some individuals even being physically assaulted and had their homes businesses or cars vandalized since the animal enterprise terrorism law was enacted in 1992 there have been some1 100 complaints of such incidents with property losses reported of being more than 120 million those complaining include farmers scientists biomedical and biotechnology industries research universities teaching hospitals financial institutions magazines newspapers and other advertising groups and others who are viewed as assisting or enabling targeted animal enterprises the evidence is that in many instances extremist elements among the animal rights groups are taking advantage of the fact that the animal enterprise laws do not cover affiliates and associates by using threats harassment intimidation and fear and other extreme tactics to pressure them into severing their activities with such enterprises s 3880 is designed to cover these gaps or loopholes by providing to employees businesses and associates of animal enterprises similar protections to those already covered in other words the bill prevents a person from doing indirectly to an animal enterprise what they are prohibited to do directly now citizens engaging in legitimate animal enterprise activities and anyone associated with them are entitled to be protected from criminal acts and to be able to go about their daily a tivities free from threats to their person or property and that of their family and associates state laws are generally good at providing those protections however the interstate nature of the planning and execution of the criminal harassment tactics used by some individuals or groups skilled at exploiting gaps or weaknesses in the laws have made it difficult for states to get at problems effectively that is why this bill is deemed necessary while we must protect those engaged in animal enterprises we must also protect the right of those engaged in first amendment freedoms of expres sion regarding such enterprises it goes without saying that first amendment freedoms of expression cannot be defeated by statute however to reassure anyone concerned with the intent of this legislation we have added in the bill assurances that it is not intended as a restraint on freedoms of expression such as lawful boycotting picketing or otherwise engaging in lawful advocacy for animals in addition we also wanted to recognize that there are some who conscientiously believe that it is their duty to peacefully protest the operation of animal enterprises to the extent of engaging in civil disobedience if a groups intention were to stage a sitin or liedown or to block traffic to a targeted facility they certainly run the risk of arrest for whatever traffic trespass or other laws they may be breaking but they should not be held more accountable for business losses due to causes such as delivery trucks being delayed any more than a boycott or protest against any other business to violate the provision of the bill one must travel or otherwise engage in interstate activity with the intent to cause damage or loss to an animal enterprise while the losses of profits lab experiments or other intangible losses are included it must be proved that such losses were specifically intended for the law to be applied if there is no damage or economic loss or damage or loss is less than 10 000 the offense is a misdemeanor not a felony this bill does not satisfy everyone but it does represent a reasonable compromise in protecting employees and associates of animal

designed to target illegitimate actors who trade in counterfeit trademarks ranging from auto parts to fake labels for handbags or cologne we all agree that manufacturers have a right to ensure that fake goods are not marketed in their names and that their own goods are not marketed under fake names the bill as originally written however went further than that it was vague on the issue of whether someone other than the manufacturer could affix marks to goods that correctly identify the source of the goods this struck at the very heart of the parallel market in which third parties lawfully obtain genuine goods and make them available in discount stores without deception not only has this practice been upheld by the suprente court but it also saves consumers billions of dollars each year through negotiation with the majority and affected parties we have been able to revise the legislation to protect manufacturers target illegitimate actors and leave a legitimate industry unscathed more specifically because the bill amends the definition of a counterfeit trademark to include packaging and labeling formats which can be used lawfully by a variety of businesses the new language clarifies that the repackaging of goods that were made under the authority of the united states trademark owner is not prohibited 1545 such repackaging can include combining single products into gift sets separating combination sets of goods into individual items for resale inserting coupons into original packaging or repackaged items affixing labels to track or otherwise identify products removing goods from original packaging for customized retail displays and moving products from large end caps or display modules into smaller cases in deciding whether to bring a cause of action under the new law in situations involving the repackaging of genuine goods it is expected that the government will consider evidence that clearly shows an intent to deceive or confuse such evidence could come in the form of altering concealing or obliterating expiration dates or information important to the consumer use of the product for example safety and health information about the quality performance or use of the product or service statements or other markings that a used discarded or refurbished product is new or statenments or other markings that the product meets testing and certification requirements also relevant to a decision to bring a criminal action would be a meaningful variance from product testing and certification requirements placing seals on product containers that have been opened or otherwise adulterating the genuine product finally the bill was modified to clarify thht it was not intended to allow criminal actions against persons who with no intent to deceive or confuse traffic in goods or services that were originally manufactured under the authority of the united states trademark owner in this regard the phrase the use of which is likely to cause confusion to cause mistake or to deceive is not intended to create a new element for this cause of action but instead reiterates what is already reflected in the definition of counterfeit mark so i

just cannot help myself i feel like i must say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle well there you go again it was just 1 week ago today that mr bishop and i were discussing the merits of drilling for oil and natural gas on the beaches of florida or california and elsewhere thoughtfully the house rejected that shortsighted and illconceived plan and left my republican colleagues looking elsewhere on the map to score political points while doing absolutely nothing to help consumers or develop sound energy policy of course should illconceived ideas and shortsighted plans ever start selling for 75 a barrel i would like the drilling rights to the republican party platform there are so many things wrong with this bill it is almost like i do not know where to start so much to criticize so little time for starters let us take a look at how this bill might benefit our country using the most wildly optimistic predictions of how much extractable oil there is in the arctic national wildlife refuge using the bush administrations own estimates which are probably inflated like some of the other bush predictions we have heard over the past 5 years there are 10 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil in anwr if this is accurate then in 20 years our reliance on foreign oil would be reduced from get this reduced from 60 percent to 57 percent and would likely result in gas prices being reduced by again using administration estimates one penny per gallon well on behalf of the american people let me just say thank you for the relief at the pump in the year 2025 using less optimistic predictions being more conservative if you will there may be only 3 2 billion barrels of recoverable oil in anwr or roughly 6 months of oil based on our current consumption this is the silver bullet to our nations energy concerns once again like with the immigration issue this administration and this congress seem to only be moved to action when an issue becomes a political crisis both of these issues obviously have been a public policy crisis for years but it is election year isnt it some pay more attention to the needs of the american people when their jobs are on the line in 5 months from now you know what i find most interesting madam speaker it is the tepid support by energy companies for this proposal most of the major oil companies have recently pulled up stakes in alaska they have already come to the conclusion that this congress will probably come to i would think in maybe 5 years and another 24 votes it just does not make economic sense to drill in alaska bp amoco texaco and chevron among others are examples of companies that are questioning their former commitment to drilling in the anwr here is one of my favorites and i would advise my colleagues on the other side to pay attention because i am about to mention one of the most hallowed names from your point of view a former petroleum engineer from halliburton a company that heretofore has not seen a patch of land they did not want to exploit said recently the enthusiasm of government officials about anwr exceeds that of industry because oil companies are driven by market forces investing resources in direct proportion to the economic potential and the evidence so far about anwr is not promising but you know i am not as naive as some of my colleagues may think i know this bill is not as much about alaska as it is about florida and californias outer continental shelf i said it last week and i will repeat it again today this bill is simply trying to get the nose under the tent and using that approach it has been widely reported without much argument that opening up anwr to oil drilling is simply a political ploy to opening the door to areas that allegedly have more promise which brings us right back to where we were last week until our colleagues adam putnam lois capps and jim davis helped to straighten things out finally to add insult to injury the rules committee
