residents remains unclear the fact i find most disturbing is that it is a completely manmade crisis it grew out of the same kind of stubborn faith in austerity measures that has handicapped our ability to govern for years it grew out of a failure to protect the flint river from environmental damage it grew out of both a failure to invest in flints crumbling infrastructure and in the willful disregard for the people of that city a city in which more than 40 percent of the residents live below the poverty line and in which the majority of families are african american my colleagues and i are here on the floor this evening to urge every member of this body to understand one thing if we fail to acknowledge the issues that led to the flint water crisis we will see similar and equally devastating events in more and more cities across the country we need to recognize that tunnel vision for deficit reduction creates more problems than it solves the emergency manager appointed by governor snyder instituted a plan to run flint like a business in order to bring it back from the brink of death in the process he sought out the least expensive options for basic needs like water in doing so he decided to pull from the corrosive and contaminated flint river without ensuring the treatment protocol necessary to ensure the water was clean we now know that although the flint river is in poor shape a little additional spending could have prevented this crisis instead flint went the bare bones route leaving a generation of residents to suffer the permanent consequences congress has once more been so focused on reducing the deficit that we have lost sight of our responsibility to govern only a few months ago did we finally abandon the absurd policy of sequestration which has hampered the functioning of countless programs over the past several years the benefits of austerity and small government are questionable at best flint has proven that and we would all be wise to remember it unfortunately that is not the only lesson that we can take away from this crisis this congress has made undermining environmental and energy regulations one of its core missions in the first 100 days of the 114th congress it voted on more environmental and energy issues than on any other topic and not a single one was aimed at protecting resources like the flint river from the kind of contamination that allowed its water to corrode lead pipes if reducing the deficit has been the first priority for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle allowing corporations and big businesses to take whatever liberties with our environment they choose has to be a close second under the majority of this house our babies would choke on smog before we limit the amount of pollution a single smokestack can spew out our streams and rivers would poison even the fish swimming in them before we would set restrictions on where these companies can dump their chemical byproducts our forests and farmlands would turn barren before we would question the longterm impact of fracking it took years to turn the flint river into the downright dangerous water source that has caused so many problems but for other rivers lakes or streams there may still be time to repair or prevent the damage that we have done flint should move us to strengthen not weaken our environmental protections there is one more lesson to learn here and it is perhaps the most important the infrastructure in flint like in so many other cities is outdated and no one at the local state or federal level seems willing or capable of making the necessary investments today in our oversight and government reform committee hearing one of the topics of concern was that even if individual homes had replaced their old lead pipes the citys pipes would still have caused a major problem that is a matter of infrastructure at the most basic level in my home state of new jersey we spent more than a decade leading the way in the battle against lead poisoning but with the onset of governor christies administration all these advances have also come to an abrupt halt there there are now 11 cities with levels of lead higher than what has been reported in flint right in my state of new jersey this contamination from lead comes from paint instead of water nonetheless it is a reflection of the reduction and diminution of services and resources to make our environment safe for our communities two of these cities are right in my district still governor christies administration has ignored the problem and thoroughly failed our children by choosing not to fund our states lead abatement fund here at the federal level we can take this even further our failure to invest in transportation and energy infrastructure is building up to a crisis of a different kind a time when our roads our bridges and our power grids begin to fail there are so many lessons we need to learn from flint i have a number of colleagues who are here with me this evening who have raised their voices in support of the people of flint and who i know agree with me that this must be a watershed moment we need to change course to prevent this from happening again and ensure the future of our nation before i turn this over i want to take a moment to add that there are a number of organizations coalitions and other associations that consistently are dedicated to protecting our natural resources they defend the clean water act and they fight for the clean air act i hope to see more of them fighting for flint in the near future i yield to the gentleman from michigan who not only represents the district in which there is flint but he is a resident born and raised in the city of flint michigan"],

problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year"], [4.6133995056152344e-05, 0.9999538660049438, 1, "let me start by saying how disappointed i am by the inadequate and long overdue response by this republican majority to the zika crisis with nearly 1 400 americans including more than 275 pregnant women who are currently infected with the virus and well over a million cases expected before the end of the year it is absolutely shameful that this house has failed to act on legislation to adequately fund a response to this potentially devastating crisis zika is not coming to the united states it is here as summer arrives along with mosquito season the mosquito that carries the zika virus will be active and knocking on the doors of our southern states and territories this is an emergency and it should be treated as such but my friends on the other side of the aisle have spent months in delaying action and in making excuse after excuse after excuse about why we dont need to provide the full funding that our nations public health experts say we need i appreciate the fact that my friends on the other side of the aisle consider themselves public health experts but there are people who are trained to be public health experts who tell us that what we are doing here today is underfunding an adequate response to this crisis i suppose i shouldnt be surprised by this as my friends in the majority have made it a habit of ignoring the advice of scientists and of experts in favor of appeasing a small group in their conference on the extreme right in february president obama requested 1 9 billion to address the public health threat that is posed by the zika virus instead of taking the swift action that was needed to confront this crisis the house delayed and delayed and delayed as the zika crisis continued to spread we should have sent a bill to president obamas desk months ago but instead this leadership allowed months to go by without there being any action on this issue until last week when they brought to the floor a completely inadequate 622 million package that provides only onethird of the funds that have been requested by the administration house democrats under the leadership of leader pelosi and appropriations committee ranking member lowey have tried to bring to the floor meaningful emergency funding to address zika only to be blocked by house republicans five times while the administration has taken significant steps to help keep americans safe from the zika virus significant additional appropriations are needed in a letter to speaker ryan omb director shaun donovan and national security advisor susan rice said without emergency supplemental funding mosquito control and surveillance may need to be suspended state and local governments that manage mosquito control may not be able to hire personnel for mosquito mitigation efforts and vaccine developments which require multiyear funding commitments may be jeopardized to make matters worse house republicans sent to the floor last week and again this week a bill to undermine the clean water act and protections for our waterways under the guise of helping to contain the zika virus but the truth of the matter is that the legislation is nothing more than a carveout for pesticide special interests and it would have absolutely no effect on spraying pesticides to combat the spread of the zika virus it is a bill my friends have brought to the floor in the past but they just couldnt help themselves in using this crisis as an excuse to further undermine environmental protections instead of working with democrats to address this public health emergency in a serious bipartisan way that puts the health and safety of the american people first the republican leadership has once again brought to the floor partisan legislation that will not adequately meet the needs of the cdc of the nih of the usaid and of other governmental agencies that are on the front lines in responding to this crisis let me close by saying that i have great respect for the gentleman from oklahoma when he says that he intends to support every effort to make sure that adequate funding is available if i thought this whole decision were up to him alone i dont think i would be as nervous as i am at this particular point but his party that is in control has shut this government down we have seen them lurch from one crisis to another crisis and underfund one priority after another priority quite frankly i dont trust the people who are running this house to do the right thing to be able to get a majority of their majority to go along with providing the appropriate funding yes we all want to be fiscally responsible but let me tell you this if all you are worried about is the bottom lineand that is the costby not adequately funding what is needed to combat this crisis the costs that will result if this crisis gets out of control will be prohibitive you aint seen nothing yet so we can nickelanddime this all we want but we do so at our own peril we ought to be concerned primarily with the safety and wellbeing of the citizens of this country but if that is not enough to prompt my friends on the other side of the aisle to support the presidents request i would suggest that the cost of ignoring this problem of not adequately funding an appropriate response will be a cost like you have never seen before i urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and to bring up strong bipartisan legislation that will fully fund the administrations request this is a public health emergency and we must act now i reserve

commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is

and congresswoman beatty for organizing this very important special order and for your tremendous leadership congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty on ensuring public safety your leadership both congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries has been bold it has been visionary not just as the result of the very recent tragedies but for many many years even before both of you came to congress so it is an honor serving with both of you in this body thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening also i want to just thank congresswoman robin kelly who is the vice chair on the gun violence task force she also chairs the cbcs health braintrust i thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem which it is i rise this evening with my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to call on congress to do somethingto do somethingabout the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities since the start of the yearjust 11 days agonine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides my thoughts are with the victims family at this very terribly difficult time we have to do something enough is enough congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence whether it is charleston oak creek sandy hook the streets of oakland or wherever too many people have already lost their lives too many families have buried loved ones and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence now is the time for action our constituents are demanding action the country is demanding action i have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents and i know other members are also hearing from their constituents they are calling for action as well earlier today in my own district oakland city council president lynette gibson mcelehany buried her grandson 17yearold torian hughes who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before christmas this has been a very difficult period for council member mcelehany and her family so in addition to our prayers not only for my council members family but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence we must do something we must do something in all of their memory let me be clear congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents their families and communities last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of americans in applauding president obamas actions to reduce gun violence in our nation thanks to the presidents leadership there will be more background checks better enforcement of existing gun laws improved mental health services and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence but more action is needed to stop the more than 30 000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year congress must pass commonsense gun reform like closing the gun show loophole bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans and gun owners congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services but this should not be an excuse of course to do nothing on gun safety we have got to provide the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nations gun laws as a member of the appropriations committee i have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe we must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcements ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue that is why i introduced last year h r 1449 the tiahrt restrictions repeal act which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks these data restrictions are commonly called the tiahrt restrictions they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyedmind you destroyedwithin 24 hours prohibiting the atf from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers this is outrageous we have got to restrict and repeal these tiahrt amendments right away it will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals it is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes the tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers law enforcement and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community of course many of us are proud to support congresswoman kellys bill which would allow the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue and the consumer product safety commission to regulate firearms the time for action is now lets start listening to the american people and insist that congress do something it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this bodyfor yearsto get these sensible bills passed the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that congress can act no more excuses we should support congressman thompsons proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence the speaker should do this now so we cant continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about congress we need to do our job we have been trying many of us the congressional black caucus and others especially democrats for many years to try to get the speaker to bring these bills to the floor so what did the president do he had to do something but no more excuses congress needs to act so i thank congresswoman beatty and

from new york for yielding me time to talk about my colleagues the republicans budget which is something i oppose i oppose it for a number of policy reasons but i thought i would spend my time today talking about what i view is a more fundamental analytical flaw in the budget and that relates to the overall goal of the budget because if you have the wrong goal you often make a series of bad decisions to support that goal so i think it is important that we talk about what the goal of the budget is and what the goal of the budget should be the goal of the republican budget is to have zero deficits within 10 years in my opinion that is the goal because it sounds good we have all heard the line that we should not spend more money than we take in that sounds really good but it ignores to many extents the basic math of budgets it is also an unrealistic goal and it is also an unnecessary goal and as a result of pursuing an unrealistic and unnecessary goal a series of very bad decisions are embedded in the budget which is why i want to talk about the goal it is an unrealistic goal when you look at the condition of the federal budget at this moment in time after several decades of this congress and several administrations ignoring in many ways the fiscal responsibility of this great country and allowing our debt to become such a high percentage of our economy we put ourselves in a position where we have had very significant deficits and the debt levels are such that we have very limited financial flexibility as a country and if interest rates were to go up it would increasingly consume a very large percentage of our budget that is the problem and that is the situation we find ourselves in in addition mr chair we are entering a phase where the demographic trends in the country and the aging on a relative basis of the population are putting tremendous pressure on the resources of the federal government so this is a very very challenging time to take a budget that has had very significant deficits and try to bring them to zero within 10 years that is why it is unrealistic it is also unnecessary because the most important metric in the financial health of the united states of america is our debt as a percentage of our economy if we want to lower our debt as a percentage of our economy what we have to do is have a budget where our deficits expressed as a percentage of our economy are consistently lower than economic growth so we should be targeting deficits of 1 to 2 percent with a view that the minimum baseline economic growth of this country will be 2 to 3 percent and definitionally over time that will take the debt of the country as a percentage of the country down it will give us more financial flexibility in the future and position us so that when interest rates rise which they will it will consume a much smaller percentage of our budget that should be the goal but because we have this unrealistic and unnecessary goal of getting deficits to zero within 10 years my republican colleagues are forced to overcorrect in the budget to achieve that goal there are two fundamental ways to overcorrect in a budget you either raise taxes very high to get revenues to get it to zero or you cut investments very significantly now my republican colleagues dont choose to raise taxes in fact what they choose to do is to cut taxes which makes an already unrealistic goal more unrealistic so the only thing that is left the only thing that is left to bring this budget to zero within 10 years is massive massive reductions in the investments we are making in our future and in our nation which to me is a very odd decision in light of the facts that are in front of us and the facts that are in front of us are very clear we are in a global and very competitive economy and we havent made the investments particularly in things like infrastructure to position this country to compete as successfully as it should in a world that is increasingly interconnected also we have to make investments in our children mr chair we are in a knowledgebased economy and to make sure that our kids are capable of being employed and having a rising standard of living across their lives we have to invest in their future so to achieve this unrealistic goal my republican colleagues make very significant very very significant cuts to these critical investments which you could argue it has never been more important to do that in fact they bring many of these levels down to half of what they have been historicallyagain and importantly expressed as a percentage of our economy because it is irrelevant to talk about absolute numbers the only numbers that should be talked about is the budget in terms of a percentage of our economy that is why i view this budget as so troubling and misguided mr chair i spent my whole career prior to coming to congress running publicly traded companies that i started i used to observe other managers who are running publicly traded companies from time to time make really bad decisions about what to do with their business those bad decisions were often based on a fundamental premise that they would pander to the market and put forth unrealistic expectations they would make bad decisions to achieve those expectations and the story would end badly the acting chair the time of the gentleman has expired"],

special order hour today and throughout the second session of the 114th congress it has been an honor and a privilege to work closely with her she has done such a phenomenal job not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of columbus ohio but all throughout the nation in her various roles and certainly in her leadership in the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i stand on the floor of the house of representatives today and with great sadness acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in orlando florida the worst mass shooting in the history of the united states of america it is a complicated shooting we understand that it most likely is an act of terror a hate crime of unspeakable proportions there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse the shooter appeared to have been in some measure on the fbis radar but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destructionwhich should be reserved for war not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republicand inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others martin luther king jr once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends during the 114th congress there have been more than 100 mass shootings we often come to the floor of the house of representatives and the speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us as members of the house to stand in a moment of silence and then we go on with business as usual having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in america the rest of the world is looking around and saying what are they doing in the united states of america five percent of the worlds population 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land the fbi and local law enforcement cant tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice this is an issue of course that has great impact on the african american community homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger african american men so we in the cbc view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community i think it is one that all americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country but the thing that is also troublingand we will have time to deal with this tragedyis hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list cant purchase weapons of mass destruction how complicated is that to do but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that when you look at some of the leading causes of deathheart disease being number one and then of course diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic certain forms of cancer hiv aids infectionmany of these illnesses these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn in bedfordstuyvesant in east new york in ocean hillbrownsville in canarsie and in the west end of coney island are preventable preventable by better exercise preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many lowincome communities of color have been subjected to resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness preventable by better diet senator booker recently said to many of usand this has stuck with methat more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drivethroughs not drivebys that is because the diet the access to healthy food is limited the food deserts within which many african americans particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level are forced to reside in are scandalous so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful comprehensive fashion i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island coney island cathedral one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists a lack of access to healthy food in the black community it is a campaign that we want to take across the nation we are thankful for the work that has been done by the congressional black caucus and by president obama through his leadership of the affordable care act we now know that over 20 million previously uninsured americans now have access to quality affordable health caredisproportionately african american that is a positive step in the right direction but instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward as house republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutionalnot once but twiceby the united states supreme court lets figure out ways to come together as a nation despite our racial religious and ethnic differences to deal with the disparities that exist in the african american community and beyond and let us come together as a congress and as a nation to deal with the scourge of hate in its most recent form directed at the lgbt community down in orlando in such a horrific and invidious fashion we are better than this we can do much better here in the united states congress the congressional black caucus is here to lead the way on issues worked in partnership hand in hand with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle if they are just willing to meet us some of the way to deal with the issues of health disparities in the african american community and deal with the scourge of gun violence that

seniors about 2 000 students in total almost all of the students i meet are unitedstates citizens the majority are latinos some have immigrant parents and most will soon be eligible to vote all of them have one question for me it starts every q and a at every high school i visit the questions are about donald trump is he going to be our next president is it true that he wants to revoke our citizenship and deport us to the countries our parents came from is it true he wants to round us up mr gutirrez and deport us all it is very sad when the questions a congressman gets from american high school students are about how much they should fear their own government whether their own government is going to break up their families whether their own government is going to treat them not as citizens and as equal partners but as outsiders and pariahs in their own country when they hear that trump is leading in the polls they think that means there is a pretty good chance that he will be the next president when they see him on tv shows like jimmy fallon not to mention cnn and fox news they get the feeling that he is a celebrity that all of us in america admire when they hear that trump is hosting saturday night live not just being a guest but actually hosting even after saying mexican are mostly rapists criminals and drug dealersthey get the impression that calling whole groups of people rapists criminals and drug dealers based on their ethnicity or national origin is basically okay with us in america the real question these chicagoarea high school students have is hey gutierrez what are you going to do to defend us from donald trump what are you going to do to stand up for us this leads to an intense discussion about american politics and i ask the students right back what are you going to do to stand up for yourselves for your community look motivating 17 and 18yearolds to do something is not always easy including motivating them to register to vote when they are old enough and to actually go out and vote but when i ask these young americans whether they plan to get registered and vote every hand goes up in the classroom donald trump is spurring youth voter mobilization like i have never seen before nationally we know that 93 percent of latinos under the age of 18 are citizens of the united states and that every 30 seconds a latino citizen turns 18 that is about a million a year for the next decade or so if they are half as motivated as the young people i am talking to in chicago donald trump could have a tremendous impact on the youth vote in the coming election but lets be honest do we really want to motivate civic participation through fear of deportation racial profiling and families being broken up these are american teenagers growing up to distrust their government trump wants to take us back to the good old days of race relations which apparently means the 1950s when president eisenhower evicted millions of immigrants and unitedstates citizens from the united states dr carson who believes that human history is only about 5 000 years oldthat is what he says we have only been around 5 000 yearssays of mass deportation schemes i think its worth discussing here in the house we have considered measures to deport children more quickly to make groups more distrustful of the police and to delay homeland security funding testifying on one of these bills before the rules committee last year i made the unfortunate but real suggestion that republicans were gravitating toward mass deportation policies which provoked a response from the chairman mr sessions he said gutierrez there is no one in responsible republican leadership that has said we should deport 13 or 11 million people and i find it extremely distasteful that people would come here and suggest things that we have not suggested well now that people are suggesting mass deportation openly and are gaining in the public opinion polls in the republican party i wonder why there is so much silence from the republican members of this body but it is not just young latino voters in chicago that are being motivated by republican attacks when republicans attack planned parenthood and block laws to guarantee equal pay for women that motivates women to register and vote when republicans celebrate people who will not issue marriage licenses to two men or two women a lot of people in the lgbt community get motivated to register and vote when republicans rail against unions and block increases in the minimum wage while of course they earn 174 000 a year and block environmental standards and block sensible gun laws a lot of working class and middle class americans get motivated to register and vote together with those young people i talked about at

undermined by a littlenoticed bill which is this bill advanced thursday by republicans on the house ways and means committee this is basically saying that this opens up a loophole that quite frankly can be very very dangerous so i urge my colleagues that if this rule gets passed that they would vote against this bill again as i mentioned on the defense appropriations bill it is a bill that is based on budget gimmicks and it is also a bill that continues to fund endless wars without having any authorization from this congress we have not voted on an aumf for the most recent war in iraq and in syria i find it unconscionable that we have no problem just putting these wars on automatic pilot and having our brave men and women in uniform in harms way and we dont even have the guts to debate it we have tried and tried and tried and tried on various billson authorization bills and on appropriations billsto be able to have that debate there is always an excuseoh it is a different committee jurisdiction oh we have to give it more than 10 minutes oh we have to do this we have to do thatbut this is our constitutional responsibility we have time to vote on all these other bills that quite frankly are going nowhere that are political messaging pieces written at the national republican congressional committee but we cant find the time to debate these wars to clarify what our mission isthese wars that our brave men and women in uniform have been put in harms way to deal with come on at some point we have to find the courage to debate this if people think these wars are the right way to go or they want to expand presidential authority then that is how you do it if people like me think our military footprint is too big in the middle east and that we need to have a more clearly defined mission about what we are doing then that is the forum in which we restrain these wars but to do nothingto do nothingis cowardly it is just wrong i am hoping in the amendment process that we will have the opportunity to debate some of these issues but if history is any indication the answer is probably not finally i am urging my colleagues to defeat the previous question quite frankly instead of these flawed bills we should be debating how to prevent more tragedies like the one that took place in orlando if we defeat the previous question we will bring up a bill that is a bipartisan bill that would simply say that if you are on an fbi watch list so you are unable to fly then you should be unable to buy a gun at a gun store it is that simple i dont quite understand why that is such a big deal if the fbi believes that you are potentially dangerous so that they will not allow you to fly on an airplane then how in the world can we allow that person to go into a gun store and buy a gun and not just any gun they can buy an assault weapon it is crazy we have tried on numerous occasions to bring this issue to the floor and house republicans have voted 11 times11 timesto block the bipartisan no fly no buy legislation that was originally authored by my republican colleague congressman peter king since taking control of the house in 2011 my republican friends have drastically cut the resources available for law enforcement slashing the cops program which includes cops hiring cops technology interoperability et cetera by 64 percent we need to respond to these terrible tragedies and make sure that our communities have what they need to keep people safe according to the government accountability office as my colleague from california pointed out more than 2 000 suspects on the fbis terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in the united statesmore than 2 000 these are people who cant fly on airplanes because they are suspected of being terrorists but they can go in and buy a firearm more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who attempted to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon they wanted with just 190 rejected despite their ominous history this legislation that we want to bring to the floorjust so there is no misunderstanding herewas originally crafted in 2007 and endorsed by president bushs justice department it has bipartisan support in the house and is supported by prominent republicans and counterterrorism and law enforcement experts yet we cant find the time to bring it to the floor all we can do in the aftermath of terrible massacres like the one in orlando is come to the floor and have a moment of silence for 10 seconds and that is it that is our obligation it is awful that we cant deal in a responsible way with legislation like the bills that i have mentioned here i think the american peopleand this goes beyond political affiliationare getting sick of our inaction on this stuff i should just say if my friends are afraid of the nra according to a 2012 poll 71 percent of current or former nra members and 80 percent of other gun owners support preventing people on a terrorist watch list from purchasing guns i dont know what it is going to take but i will tell you this the outrage is already beyond description here on the house floor of people who are simply tired of our inaction so i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defeat the previous question so we can actually have a debate and vote on something that might save some lives and also vote

but at this time i have to oppose it i appreciate that mr takano does believe that we need to provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so once again i urge members to support change and stand with veterans not the bureaucrats and the special interest groups and the status quo i urge members to oppose the takano substitute

passed congress in 1961 if you mention foreign aid to many americans it raises their blood pressure members of our communities often are concerned about foreign aid to other countries because they are just not quite sure where that aid is going and what that aid is accomplishing it is important that we as members of the house of representatives legislatively communicate to america how americas money is being spent in foreign countries it is important that we are accountable and that that money that aid is accountable to the taxpayers it may shock you madam speakermaybe it wontbut congress has never passed a law requiring transparency and accountability of foreign aid i will use a different phrase we have never audited our foreign aid to see if it is working and to see what it is doing so people can see whether it is successful or not the american public is uninformed about how much we spend and why we spend that money a recent publish what you fund study rated half of unitedstates agencies in the poor category when it came to transparency of aid transparency is important because it sheds light on where the money is spent it is a lot harder to steal money if everybody knows where the money went and what it was for the american people have a right to know what we are doing with their money there are a lot of success stories but many americans dont know about them so it is important that we post that information and that the agencies that help in foreign aid assistance post that information on the web so we know who is getting the money and what they are doing with that money transparency will help foreign aid it will make it harder for bad actors to steal that aid it will make those who implement our programs work more vigilantly knowing the information will also be posted online it will educate the american public about all the ways our country is helping other people around the world as i said there are a lot of success stories where people are better off because america is helping them transparency by itself however wont save all of foreign aids problems but without transparency those problems will not be solved we also need to evaluate our foreign aid program so we know what works the key portions of this bill are transparency of the aid and evaluation of the aid evaluate that aid to see if it is working and if it is working may continue to do that aid evaluate aidif it is not working then we cut it off and do something else we have all heard about the boondoggles of foreign aid big infrastructure projects are especially prone to waste and mismanagement that is why it is so critically important that as part of this bill being implemented licensed engineers who know how to do these infrastructure projects are more involved with their expert input and operational skills let me give you some examples of where foreign aid has been mismanaged schools are being built by americans overseas but some of those schools never had a student attend them the special inspector for iraq reconstruction found out that at least 8 billion in american taxpayer dollars was lost to fraud waste and abuse 44 million was spent on a residential camp to house international police trainers the camp included an olympicsized swimming pool the problem is swimming pool and all it was never used the 43 million natural gas station in afghanistan was built by the department of defense when it built the same kind of gas station for 500 000 in pakistan let me explain that again american taxpayers built a 43 million natural gas station besides the enormous outrageous cost nobody ever used the gas station in afghanistan so rigorous evaluations of our foreign aid are important because they can tell us whether or not we are really making a lasting impact we have a long way to go and the state department really doesnt have a system in place to keep track of the dollars spent on evaluation of those projects the state department can only tell how much it plans to spend in the future but as soon as it spends that money on evaluations it has no way of tracking where the money went so the state department cant even tell how many evaluations were even done last year on the aid that we are already spending even in its policy the state department is moving in the wrong direction its new evaluation policy lowers the amount of evaluations that must be done usaid has some troubling signs as well usaid spent less money on evaluations in 2014 than it did in 2013 to solve some of these problems with transparency and with accountability of our foreign aid representative connolly and myself have introduced h r 3766 the foreign aid transparency and accountability act this bill requires the president to issue guidelines requiring tough evaluations and on transparency it codifies what is already being done and increases the amount of information required to be posted online including actual expenditures and evaluations so everyone knows what we are doing and whether it is working or not we need to be reporting on more foreign aid in a more understandable way the american people want to know where their aid is going what it is for and if that aid is effective transparency and accountability for our foreign aid this is a commonsense bill and it doesnt cost any money i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9999245405197144, 0.9999245405197144, 0,

very fitting in recognition of her work and her life in rising today i join with many northstate residents in honoring the life and legacy of isaac lowe an incredible woman and a prominent civil rights leader who passed away just a few weeks ago in redding california she was born in 1921 in wharton texas isaac was the second youngest of nine children learning early the importance of hard work she attended tillotson business college in austin texas and prairie view a m in prairie view it was during a visit to check up on a sick friend in california when she met her future husband vernon lowe whom she married soon after and started her family in redding california being an african american woman in the 1940s unfortunately racism was no stranger to isaac despite holding a business degree she was denied jobs because employers chose to judge her skin color rather than her impressive credentials isaac did not give up she started a catering business in redding and she eventually became the first black woman to be hired by the county of shasta working in social services for 17 years and helping others however isaacs most noble work was through her plight to advance racial equality in her own neighborhood upon first moving to redding all but one of the black families lived on the same street and were segregated from the community this was a status quo that she didnt accept isaac joined her husband in founding the redding chapter of the naacp and began her 65year journey of advocating for civil rights and worked very hard in order to hold onto that charter of the naacp when times got a little leaner back in the seventies she lobbied city and county lawmakers for safe and affordable housing for black families she worked with local school officials for the equal treatment of black children in the communitys mainly white schools she fought for fairness and justice under the law for all citizens in the judicial system she raised funds and successfully sought approval from city hall for the construction of the only martin luther king jr community center between sacramento and oregon at that time it was her compassionate advocacy and her resiliency that helped change shasta county for the better some of her most notable accomplishments included being the first black woman to serve on shasta countys grand jury where she served as a founding member of the shasta county citizens against racism and was awarded the redding citizen of the year in 1992 her proudest moment was in getting the redding city council members to recognize martin luther king day as a holiday her legacy speaks volumes of the person she was and of the impact she had on so many lives one of the anecdotes i know about her informally is that she was fairly commonly referred to as the rosa parks of redding california she was a deeply caring friend a loving wife and mother and a selfless advocate i had the chance to meet isaac personally on different occasionssome positive and one actually a very negative occasion but it was made positive by how the community responded to a very ugly racial incident that took place against a black family in their home many of us in the community joined together in a march in solidarity protesting that we were not going to tolerate this in our community in northern california isaac was there being strong but also being that smiling positive voice you could see her strength you could also see the light shining from within her as she advocated for what was right for everybody really at the end of the day if we had more people like her and if we had more harmony instead of the divisiveness that we see so badly affecting this country today we would be much better off northern california has lost a gem but her legacy will live on and we all recognize that i am honored to be able to note that here today on the unitedstates house floor and to properly show that her legacy even lives on in the papers she published and that are

america today we passed a bill here about a month ago in the house of representatives to eliminate the term oriental from the law books i submit that eliminating a term does not eliminate the racism that embodies that term and i think it is about time that we recognize what this problem is the fact that it still festers in america and give some thought to what we can do about it i want to begin by relating two stories both from my home state of florida the first one involves a 16yearold girl she was white she had an encounter with police officers who were also white she lived on the atlantic coast which is largely white and i heard about this from a friend of a friend what happened to her is that her parents got a call from the police officers late one night they didnt tell her why they were calling but they said you have to come to this location we need to talk to you about your daughter she is here with us the mother went to that location spoke to the white police officers they informed her that her daughter had been drinking in a car with her boyfriend and they needed to take her home she was shaken up a bit so was the daughter but everybody ended that night alive now i want to tell you a different story it didnt end so nicely this was on the gulf coast the coast of florida that is heavily african american and on the gulf coast one night there was a theme park you could call it a fairgrounds that was open to all students without having to pay they could go on the rides enjoy themselves one day each year this is done in tampa now teenagers being teenagers some of them got a little bit out of hand many african americans frequent that area and they were out in force that night at the fairgrounds there was a great deal of friction that night between the white police force and the african american teenagers who were there that night some of them actually started running around might have bumped into a few other people as they were running around someone started to scream you will notice that apart from that physical contact nothing i described is actually against the law like for instance drinking in a car with your boyfriend when you are 16 years old a number of them about a hundred african american youths were arrested that night 2 years ago in tampa the white police officers insisted that they strip to the waist that apparently was for the purpose in the minds of the police officers to see whether they had gang colors on their bodiesat least that is what they said now one of them andrew joseph iii actually hadnt done any of that running around any of that screaming any of that casual bumping he hadnt done any of that but he saw his classmates being arrested he came to see what was going on he saw that one of them had his hat fall off his head he went over and he picked it up the officer said i didnt say you could do that they arrested him for picking up his friends hat they took andrew joseph a 14yearold boy 2 miles away from the fairgrounds and they pushed him out of the police car and said you are on your own a 14yearold boy who has parents who were reachable by a telephone they pushed him out in a neighborhood he had never seen before never been to before had no idea where he was he remembered that his father was going to pick him up at the fairgrounds he felt pretty shaken up because he had just been arrested and was told to strip to the waist and frankly felt humiliated he found his way as best he could back to the fairgrounds 2 miles away he didnt call his parents because frankly he was scared embarrassed didnt want them to know he almost got as far as the fairgrounds he tried to cross the interstate highway to get to the fairgrounds in the midst of traffic in both directions he was struck by a car and died right on the spot immediately one 16yearold girl white alive today one 14yearold boy african american dead this is his picture andrew joseph iii this is what this boy looked like he was a good student quite an athlete had a wonderful future ahead of him but not being white his parents didnt get a call that night to say to come pick him up i submit to you this is not just one persons tragedy it is not just the tragedy of these parents standing at his gravesite it is the tragedy of america we persist in being a country of sometimes casual racism racism that sometimes goes unnoticed if you say a bad word that begins with the letter n and there happens to be a recording device nearby you will certainly be scolded and to some degree held accountable that much is true but institutionalized racism racial profiling redlining is not treated the same way because it is just too hard it is much like the concept that if we close our eyes to it it will somehow disappear a 1yearold maybe a 2yearold might think that way but a country of 330 million why do we ever think that way now i wish i could tell you that the story somehow had a happy ending it doesnt this kind of institutionalized racism goes on today i asked the fbi to investigate whether there is racial profiling by the police force in tampa they are thinking about it i dont know if they are going to say yes or they are going to say no i cant tell for sure that is their decision not mine i remember when i was a boy a great man said he hoped to see a day in america where his four children were judged not by the color of their skin but by their character i submit to you this boy was judged by the color of his skin and he is not the only one we live in an america today a country where 29 percent of white adults have college degrees 18 percent of african americans have college degrees if andrew joseph iii had lived then his chance of getting a college degree would have been stunted perhaps even forbidden by the color of his skin now if he had lived whether or not he had gone to college he would have grown up in a country where african americans like him have an average household income of 37 000 whites have an average income of 57 000 the color of his skin you could say if he lived would have cost him 20 000 a year that is our new poll tax 20 000 a year if he had managed to get across that highwayi imagine him being picked up safely by his father that night whom you see here on my rightthen as an african american male his life expectancy would have been 73 years the life expectancy of white males in this country including me is 78 years now it is a great tragedya great great tragedythat we stole 50 years of life from this one boy but how much greater tragedy is it that we steal 5 years of life from 40 million we are in danger at this point of becoming a society that is not colorblind not blind to color but rather a country that is blind to racism there is an easy way to end this problem it is called doing something about it it is called pulling ourselves together in the same way that we began to do in the 1960s acknowledging these differences and then remedying them i well recall that in the current presidential election the former governor of my state jeb bush spent 125 million on his campaign and got four votesfour votes convention votes but i remember that it never came up that jeb bush wiped out destroyed eliminated blew up affirmative action in my state of floridaand now it is gone so the question before us is writ small how do we acknowledge that black lives matter how do we acknowledge that a terrible tragedy took place here and robbed this good young man of his life and writ large what do we finally dofinally finally finally50 years after the civil rights movement began to end inequality in this country end it it starts with justice and it ends with equality not just the pablum of equality of opportunity that buzz phrase that we use in order to solve our consciences but rather the equality of results an america where an african american boy is just as likely to go to college as a white boy an america where an african american is just as likely to earn as much money as a white and for gods sake an african american can live as long as a white man does i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9999068975448608, 0.9999068975448608, 0,

that meet the standard i have bought them myself they are the same as the old bulbs except that they last longer they use less electricity and they save consumers money we have heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict consumer choice but if you have shopped for light bulbs lately you know that simply isnt true modern incandescent bulbs compact fluorescent light bulbs and leds of every shape size and color are now available consumers have never had more choice the efficiency standards spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers critics of the efficiency standards claimed that they would cost consumers money in fact the opposite is true when the standards are in full effect the average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets worse the rider now poses an additional threat to unitedstates manufacturing the bipartisan 2007 energy bill requires the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is this rider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb the burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania ohio illinois across our region it would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing this rider aims to reverse years of technological progress only to kill jobs increase electricity bills for our constituents and worsen pollution it is time to choose common sense over rigid ideology and it is time to listen to the manufacturing companies consumer groups and efficiency advocates who all agree that that rider is harmful i urge all members to vote no on the burgess light bulb rider no matter

legislation mr oberstar served in the house for a remarkable 36 years and i think it is very fitting and appropriate to honor his legacy by lending his name to a post office in his hometown of chisolm congressman oberstar was born in chisholm minnesota on september 10 1934 and graduated from the high school there in 1952 four years later he earned a bachelor of arts from the university of st thomas in st paul minnesota he later earned a masters degree from the college of europe in bruges belgium a lot of people knew he was very fluent in french and liked to express himself on many trips in french before running for congress himself congressman oberstar served on the staff for congressman john blatnik of minnesota from 1963 to 1974 in that capacity he worked with congressman blatnik on all of the legislation from the public works and transportation committee in the last 3 years he was with congressman blatnik congressman oberstar became the chief of staff for that committee congressman oberstar was first elected to represent the people of minnesotas eighth district in 1974 among many notable achievements he served as chairman of the committee on transportation and infrastructure in the 110th and 111th congresses in total he served in 18 congresses sadly mr oberstar passed away on may 3 2014 in potomac maryland he certainly was a devoted public servant who left a remarkable legacy of service to the citizens of minnesota and the united states earlier in this congress there was another tribute for congressman oberstar at that time i said this it is an astounding figure to think that a man worked on this one committee for 47 years of his life but he did so with great honor and distinction in fact i think most everybody knew that there was no one in the congress and probably never has been anyone in the history of the congress who has known transportation issues and understood them and worked on them longer and harder and with more effectiveness than jim oberstar did at one point he was chairman of the aviation subcommittee in 1994 after the election the republicans took control and i had the honor of becoming the chairman of the aviation subcommittee and i served for 6 years in that position which was the maximum allowable on our side when i took over as chairman of the aviation subcommittee i frequently heard jim oberstar referred to as mr aviation so i went to him and asked for his help and he helped me guided me and gave me advice that to this day i appreciate very much he did so in a very kind and humble way of course then he reached the pinnacle and became chairman of that committee a committee that he loved he was a great chairman he worked across the aisle in a very bipartisan way and i think he tried to help everyone
