offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.015282928943634033, 0.984717071056366, 1, "house resolution 470 provides for the consideration of the bill to authorize the minting and sale to the public of the unitedstates legal tender commemorative coins to support the 1984 los angeles olympic games the rule provides for 2 hours of general debate the time is divided equally between the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs the first reading of the bill is dispensed with since the report on the bill has not been available for the required 3 days the rule waives clause 2 1 6 of rule xi againd consideration of the bill ordinarily the rules committee does not look favorably on requests to waive the layover rule however the urgency of establishing the method for the minting and the marketing of these commemorative coins was in the judgment of the committee sufficient to move forward with the bill the banking committee estimates a time lag of at least 1 year for the bidding process to be completed and the coins to be minted and sold each day of delay jeopardizes prospects of making the kind of sales which will genuinely benefit our athletes and the olympic committee the committee substitute will be made in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment the rule is open so that any amendment germane to the bill will be in order however the rule does specifically make one amendment and one substitute in order it will be in order to consider an amendment printed in the record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative st germain it will further be in order to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the congressional record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative annunzio the rule waives all points of order for violations of clause 5 rule xxi against the committee substitute the amendment and the annunzio substitute each of which contains appropriations language in the section providing for the distribution of funds the rule provides for a motion to reeommit with or without instructions it may seem unusual to consider a rule calling for 2 hours of debate on commemorative legislation however in the committee on rules the gentleman from illinois made an impassioned plea for 1 additional hour of debate in order that he might have ample opportunity to present his case for a different marketing approach to the olympic coins mr annunzio is chairman of the subcommittee on consumer affairs and coinage which reported by a 6 to 0 vote a procedure which varies signifi cantly from the procedure adopted by the full banking committee mr annunzio succeeded in persuading the members of the rules committee that the additional time was essential to fully air the differences of opinion in a manner which is fair to all parties since the members of the house will have sufficient time to consider two very different approaches to the sale of olympic coins i will not devote a great deal of time here to a description briefly the legislation managed on the floor by chairman st germain proposes to mint legal tender coins in 17 emblematic designs the coins would be sold through private marketers selected through a process overseen by the treasury department and allowing for competitive bidding a 30 million guarantee to the olympics is required from any private marketer receipts from sales would be split between the private marketers the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee the substitute proposed by mr annunzio and reported by the consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee recommends one silver and one gold coin marketing would be accomplished through the mint as opposed to private marketers and through bulk sales only foreign sales would be arranged through private marketers who would be chosen in a competitive bidding process all sales would require a surcharge to be divided equally between the los angeles olympic operating committee and the unitedstates olymplc committee for training and construction of training facilities though there may be disagreement over the best method of marketing an olympic coin there is no disagreement about the importance of minting an olympic coin in july and august of 1984 los angeles will be the site of the xxiii olympiad it will be the first time in half a century that a city in the united states has served as host to this prestigious sporting event and the first time in history any nation has been host to three olympic games over 150 nations throughout the world are planning to compete before a worldwide audience that could number in the billions an olympic coin program is important in two respects the tradition of minting special coins can be traced back centuries to the ancient greeks throughout history special coins played a role in generating enthusiasm and support for the games and more recently have helped fund the staging of the games so that countries from all over the world could participate second the coin program plays an important role in providing support for the training of our athletes this training is a longterm process financial support is critical to our ability to provide american youth of all ages and skills the opportunity to develop their athletic ability and to build the pride and confidence important to compete in todays world without an effective olympic coin program for the los angeles games we would lose out on an important source of these funds the legislation we have before us is vitally important i believe the rule provides a fair and orderly procedure for its

of the federal budget and the budget cuts on children in this country president reagan was right when he spoke the other night and said that millions of americans harbor the simple wish for a safe and financially secure future for their children but in fact the president is deceiving the american people into thinking that his policies will achieve such ends the administration would have us dismantle programs and policies for children and families that took 30 years to develop but on the basis of what evidence would he have us dismantle those programs the administration argued that dismantling these programs will save money but all our evfdence from the wic program for lowincome pregnant women and their infants all the evidence from the fledgling foster care reform program all of the evidence from the 17yearold title i program for educationally disadvantaged children shows just the opposite without these programs of prevention the longterm costs to the american taxpayer would have been far greater the administration argues on the basis of a few anecdotal cases that dramatic funding cuts for these programs will eliminate waste fraud and abuse if the administrations real concern is with the waste fraud and abuse why is there no administration effort to go after waste fraud and abuse in the defense budget just this week it was reported that paul thayer who is chairman of ltv a major ddfense contractor told the president that i have been in the defense contracting for over 30 years and i can tell you that 40 percent of the cost of planes i sell is attributable to redtape bureaucracy and duplicative expenditures forty percent is there a person in this congress who has been hearing lately of 40 percent of social program expenditures that are a result of redtape bureaucracy and duplicative expenditures i do not believe so that has never been alleged in this congress and yet those are the programs that have received the heaviest cuts while the heaviest increases have gone to the pentagon in fadt there has been a careful refinement of those social programs by the congress over the past years which has eliminated untargeted use of funds and abuses by program operators even in the falsely discredited food stamp program which we tend to forget has been the single most important force in eradicating hunger and malnutrition in this country even in this program usdas own figures show that fully 95 percent of the food stamp recipients are in fact eligible recipients the administration also argues that the drastic cuts in social programs are the oni hope for balancing the budget but this is patently false as the omb director stockman so convincingly revealed last year in his interview with the atlantic monthly president reagan is not willing to renege on his commitment to the wealthy individuals and corporations even by closing the huge tax loopholes or by eliminating special interest favors but the president and his advisers apparently have no qualms about breaking decades of commitments to our most valuable and vulnerable americans children and lowincome families it is time to set the record straight the programs this congress created over the past several decades are working they are saving money they are helping children to become productive citizens we did not develop these programs in the first place simply because the congress had nothing to do one day each of these programs was developed in response to some clearly identified need on the basis of extensive investigations and hearings by the congress and as a result of testimony from state and local officials who asked for our guidance and our assistance we made the commitment to those states localities and school districts as well as to the children and the parents they serve they depend on that commitnient on the basis of what evidence would we now throw away 30 years of work in these longstanding programs on the basis of what evidence would we now disinantle a program that brought this country from the depths of the depression to being the richest the freest the strongest the most able country in the history of the world as we are being asked to dismantle these programs let me ask a simple question what is it that we are apologizing for are we going to apologize for having the most successful education system in the entire world for having more young people enrolled in college than any other country for having greater literacy than any other country are we going to apologize for traveling over the best transportation system of any country in the world for cutting down the cost of bringing our goods and services to market are we going to apologize for having the best harbors and networks for the best inland and boat ways of any place in the world are we going to apologize to the millions of americans who had their homes financed by fha by the veterans programs are we going to apologize for the government providing mortgage assistance and other programp for millions of americans are we going to apologize for the fact that even today the government is spending millions of dollars to keep the savings and loans institutions from going broke thirty years ago there would have been a panic if this many savings and loans were on the poor list if this many savings and loans had to merge but it is the federal government that is picking up the pieces to the tune of millions of dollars in just the last few months because of bad management are we going to apologize because the federal government assisted tens of thousands of farmers across this country that created the most productive agricultural system in the world that not only feeds everyone in this country at lowest cost but feeds a good portion of the rest of the world and provides vital foodstuffs for those people on what evidence is one man who comes into office who weekly demonstrates his lack of knowledge of the workings of these programs and others on what evidence is this one man asking us to turn back the clock to go where we were 20 years ago to dismantle the federal government a federal government that has served the people of this country well that has provided nutrition that has provided health care for the elderly for the poor education for our children who is going to educate the next generation of children who is going to provide health care to the next generation of the elderly who is going to finance the next generation of housing the president would have us believe that charity and the private sector would they never have in the past and i do not know why they would start now there is no indication in fact that they plan to i think that as we consider the impact of last years budget cuts and as this congress engages in another round of budget cuts we had better understand the multiple impacts that these cuts start to build on our nations children as we start to cut title xx which provides help for foster grandparents programs and for children awve start to cut the education programs as the gentleman who sits with me on the education and labor committee knows we sat through several hours of hearings this morning with local representatives of the national school boards association and not one of them could tell our committee how education is better today for this nations children than it was a year ago not one of them could provide an example of how we are better serving the children of this country then we were a year ago the question this congress must face and hopefully can be addressed not only in this special order but can be addressed throughout the rest of this year is where is the evidence who can say that life is better for those children than it was a year ago let me remind you that none of those children yet have been proven to be fraudulent have been proven to be wastefull have been proven to abuse the programs that this congress and this couritry designed to help them i think before we go any further this administration has an obligation to the people of this country to show them the evidencenot the hope not the desire not the promises but the hard evidence about how their program will treat children better this year than it did last year and next year better than it did this year because these is no evidence to suggest that that will take place again i want to thank the gentleman from new york who has been deeply involved in trying to provide for those who are less fortunate than the rest of us and who has provided tremendous leadership in this congress on childrens issues every fourth of july the politicians of our country stand up and say children are our most important resource the future of our country if we do not provide for these children the country will not exist in the future if we ignore these resources we will truly be poor i guess they figure on the fourth of july the children are all of a sudden not paying attention because the rest of the year these politicians slash the budgets they ignore the children who cannot vote and so are not listened to but on the fourth of july they look at a child waving the flag and they teil that child you my dear are our worlds most important resource you are the future of our country and then when they come back to washington they ignore it they ignore it

of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"], [0.016790926456451416, 0.9832090735435486, 1, "today as some of us will begin to enjoy windfall gains from a new tax law that was approved not on the basis of being fair and equitable but as being deliberately constructed to~help the rich i hope we will not continue down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.017267882823944092, 0.9827321171760559, 1, "it is with great pride that i rise today to welcome a group of ministers from the chicago area who have journeyed here to participate in the clergy crusade and lobby the government regarding the traumatic effect the presidents fiscal year 1983 budget if passed by congress would have upon the poor the elderly the unemployed and the children it is appropriate that these ministers have chosen to come to washington this weekthe week the house will use the presidents fiscal year 1983 budget as the vehicle for the consideration of the latta and house budget committee alternative i would like to tell these ministers that this will be the week in which my colleagues will vote conscientiously and courageously by defeating the presidents budget and others which throw tax dollars to the pentagon at the expense of people programs it is doubtful that will be the case i unequivocally oppose the presidents budget primarily because of my concern over the devastating impact his budget will have upon millions of americans specifically children and the elderly president reagan has stated on too many occasions that the truly needy will not be affected by the proposed budget cuts i am sure these chicago clergy can attest to a more realistic scenario the truly needy along with unemployed middle class and bankrupted businessmen are dropping like flies through the safety net and the president has the audacity to propose even larger holes in that net it is my belief that the reagan 1983 budget undermines the moral responsibility of government to the citizens of america i agree with the great american hubert humphrey who stated the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the president has failed this test last year under his leadership the president claimed that his budget proposal was fair in fact however its cuts were disproportionately directed at programs to assist the poor and the disadvantaged including investment in health education training services and public works this year the administration has not bothered to pay lip service to the idea of fairness it has once again targeted for cutbacks the same programs which sustained deep speeding reductions last year under this budget the children will see an additional 8 billion cut in their programs child nutrition services will be cut by 334 million in budget au thority and 300 million in outlays the summer feeding programa program which helps preserve nutritional gains made by children during the school yearwill be terminated the special milk program a program which subsidizes milk consumption in schools that do not participate in other federal meal programs will be eliminated school breakfast and child care food programs will be placed in a block grant while grants for nutrition education will be terminated medicaid a health insurance program which pays the medical bills for lowincome americans children and pregnant women will again bear the brunt of the reiagan cuts the federal child support enforcement program a program which par tially reimburses states and localities for expenses in collecting child support payments from absent parents would also be drastically impacted if that is not enough approximately 165 000 women infants and children will be dropped in fiscal year 1983 from the wic program due to inadequate funding and 370 000 would have to be cut off by fiscal year 1985 this means that some half a million fewer people would be reached suffer the little children the aged and elderly are of course to assume an even heavier burden if the presidents budget is passed they can look forward to changes in the federal supplemental income ssi program which will exclude some 115 000 individuals in fiscal ydar 1983 who will not be considered permanently disabled food stamps will receive a 1 3 billion decrease from the fiscal year 1982 authorized spending level for working poor families this amounts to encouraging them not to worka philosophy supposedly counter to the reagan work ethic for our elderly less food coupled with less food stamps the lowincome energy assistance program will be cut conceivably our seniors may not have a choice between heat or eat they will not be able to do either under medicaid we would witness major legislative changes which would cut the federal payment for all services for medically needy recipients in addition to including federal payments to the states for administering medicaid in a new welfare block grant last year the president claimed he would preserve a social safety net of basic programs to protect the poor and elderly despite this claim the administration and its congressional allies forced cuts in virtuqlly every safety net program this years budget proposal continues this policy and proposes a new round of reductions in the safety net programs with cuts being requested in medicare afdc supplemental security income and others this is deplorable and further strengthens my resolve to support the program submitted by the congressional black caucus which increases funding for all the programs above while lowering the dreaded deficit in closing i again thank these chicago clergy who by making this trek to the capitol are attempting to improve the quality of life for those in the dawn those in the shadow and those in the twilight of their lives certainly they know firsthand just what damage has and will be inflicted upon the

we begin now consideration of the first of four budget resolutions made in order by the rule governing house concurrent resolution 115the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is the constructive alternative budget resolution fashioned by the 18 members of thecongressional black caucus of the house of representatives it is the one budget resolution among the four to be considered by the house which responds most succinctly and directly to the mandate given the congress and the president by the american people on november 4 1980 of the four alternatives before us it does the best job of eliminating deficit spending reducing the level of federal spending providing tax relief to the american people and spurring jobs and economic recovery for american businesses and american workers the 18 members of the congressional black caucus are now about to detail for your consideration and debate a resolution that balances the budget in fiscal year 1982 which indeed offers the american people a 7 85 billion surplus instead of the 50 4 deficit that the reaganstockman proposal imposes upon us it is a budget that spends 7 95 billion less than djes the reaganstockman proposal it in a budget resolution that offers the american people 56 4 billion in tax cuts nearly 2 billion more in tax relief than does the reagan stockman proposal and we do it in a fashion that will not concentrate 80 percent of the business and industry tax incentives among the major corporations while providing only 20 percent of the tax relief to the small businesses of the nation which account for 48 percent of private sector gross national products and employ 80 percent of the working people of the country i want you to pay particular attention to the presentations of representative ranoel and representative ford on the tax package that is part of this resolution for it goes to the heart of why we are able to respond best to the mandate of the american people the american people want a new beginning but not a new beginning that is business as usual what good is a socalled tax cut that does not deal with bracket oreep that keeps throwing american workers into higher and higher tax brackets with no real increase in income the reagan proposal continues business as usual inthis regard the congressional black caucus budget resolutionalone among the alternativesgives us a new beginning by correcting bracket creep and returning 17 billion to the american people in tax relief the reaganstockman proposal gives the american taxpayers business as usual when it fails to take into account the increased social security payments that american wage earners and businesses will have to pay this year the cbc budget gives the amer1can taxpayer and small businesses a new beginning a 10percent tax credit on social security payments that returns 10 8 billion zo the american employee and another 7 2 billion to the businesses of our country the 10percent a year acrosstheboard tax cut proposal of the reagan administration is more of the same old thing it will have the average worker earning 15 000 a year paying 93 more in federal taxes by 1984 while the twotenths of 1 percent of the people who earn 200 000 a year will have the government return nearly 20 000 a year to them the american people voted for a new beginning not more of the same old thing with respect to the budget and tax policies of this nation they voted for a balanced budget and reduced federal spending and tax relief not for a legalized raid on the treasury by rich individuals and multinational corporations that will rob the people of 220 billion a year in tax revenues by 1986 they voted for a strong america not an america weekened by throwing 1 1 million people out of work which the reagan human needs budget cuts alone would do in fiscal year 1982 and the fauntroy amendment gives them that they voted for a just and compassionate america not a callous america that would deny a 1 5 billion free lunch to hungry children while continuing a 3 billion free lunch program for the rich that we call the three martini lunch deduction the fauntroy amendiment gives the amerncan people what they voted for it is living proof that the budget can be balanced government spending decreased and tax relief given without necessarily cutting back before yielding to my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to provide you more of the details of our constructive alternative budget resolution let me say three things about this budget resolution that the democraitic study group described as the substitute that takes the boldest step of any proposal being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit that offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house and that accomplishes all of this without hurting other important national programs the first is that while the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is authored by black legislators it is not a program for black people only the most serious problems confronting this nation just happen to be reflected most acutely in the black experience this is a program for all americans the elde ly on limited income most of whom are white the struggling young couples all over the nation who want but cannot find affordable housing anywhere most of whom are white the coal miners whose black lung benefits are being threatened most of whom are white young people from low and middleincome families who would be denied guaranteed student loans and basic opportunity grants for higher education most of whom are white the sick the cold the hungry the handicapped most of whom are white and all of whose burdens will be made heavier by the grammlatta budget proposal thus the solutions we seek are not for black people only but solutions that will benefit all americans black and white together young and old together rich and poor together protestant catholic jew and gentile together the second thing i want to point out is that our constructive alternative budget is based on a different assessment of the root cause of the problem we are experiencing in our domestic economy and the arena of world affairs than that of the reagan administration a in the area of the economy we maintain that inflation unemployment and loweconomic growth are not caused by government spending government taxation and government regulation as the administration would have us believe imprudence in each of these areas contributes to our economic woes and we are as determined as president reagan to sort out waste fraud and abuse at all levels of government expenditures but the fact is that our economic woes have nothing to do with the fact that we provide food stamps for the hungry medicaid for the sick housing for the poor and public service employment for the jobless our economic difficulties are rooted in the fact that other people are making better mousetraps nowadays our difficulties are rooted in the fact that over the past 15 years or more we have had a steady decline in economip performance in manufacturing output in product design and in productivity in sector after sector we are producing insufficient quantities of poorly designed products at too high a price when you do that not only does the world not buy what we make but we do not buy what we make this is best illustrated by an experience which i had a few months ago looking for a christmas gift for my young son marvin he said he wanted a portable radio for christmas i went to one of our local department stores and saw on the shelf a portable radio by rca amfm 87 i was about to purchase it when i noticed on another shelf something called sanyo it said amfm radio three speakers and tape recorder 47 now i love america and i have sense enough to know that when i purchase american made products i am sustaining jobs for americans but when i saw something better for less i must candidly admit that i bought the sanyo and i did it not because i like strange sounding names but because it was a better mousetrap the problem with our economy is that most americans are doing just what i did we are buying datsun toyota kawasaki suzuki honda yamaha panasonic sony seiko nikon and pentax that is our problem and it will not be solved by denying students basic opportunity grants or poor children free lunch or the elderly poor medicaid the problem is that we are losing market shares in the world at large as well as at home the consequence is rising unemployment inadequate profits and therefore reduced investments still worse productivity a falling dollar and still worse inflation our goal therefore must be to restore productivity the competitiveness of unitedstates industry and our other major economic sectors in both domestic and world markets to do this we must undertake the most fundamental reassessment of our economic structure since 1932or perhaps of all time as our colleague representative augustus hawkins has repeatedly pointed out and will do so again today to remedy that problem we must begin to implement the policies called for in the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act the third thing i should like to say is that the congressional black caucus makes a different assessment of what our problems are in the areas of world affairs our view is that our problems in 1hternational affairs do not lend themselves to military solution they are social economic and political in nature and thus we have emphasized a strong national economy and food and technical assistance as the primary weapons in the arsenal for our confrontation with soviet russia we favor improved national security but without wasteful military spending our budget as representative dellums will point out today calls for defense of our nation not domination of the world our emphasis on the area of foreign affairs must be for example upon development aid and technical assistance to nations like zimbabwe so that mr mugabe may build roads from the chromium mines to the sea where we can buy it sail it to detroit and make a kcair that goes a longer way to empty than does datsun that is what we need to be doing finally our speaker of the house thomas tip oneill has prominently displayed on a desk in his office in the capitol a quote from hubert humphreys last speech on capitol hill on november 17 1977 i think that quote summarizes the choices we must make this week on our budget resolutions he said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shaows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the three other choices before you this week fail the moral test of government the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute which we now detail for you passes that test with flying colors i yield for the distinguished gentleman from new york to open our presentation of the details of our proposal"], [0.01778697967529297, 0.982213020324707, 1,

these restrictions would place an undue hardship on eligible veterans in puerto rico and the virgin islands now being furnished essential services by limiting the provision of such services in government and private facilities to the annually determined incidence of such care in the 48 contiguous states the veterans administration medical center in puerto rico is unable to meet the demand for care of veterans in that area the committees on veterans affairs of the house and senate desire to permanently resolve the provision of medical services and hospital care to veterans who are

"i thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me i am pleased to join the discussion of the federal budget for fiscal year 1982 this debate is particularly important because of the proposals offered by the reagan administration and the orammlatta substitute we should not minimize the impact of the choices we will make in voting on ljhs budget this vote involves far more than dollar levels for federal outlays it involves higher health care costs for all americans and devastating reductions in services for the poorest of the poor as chairman of the subcommittee on health and the environment i have carefully assessed the impact of the administrations budget proposal on the health of our people i am very concerned that these proposals are not in the best interest of the nation these proposals seek a major restructuring of federal efforts and directions in health care they would halt 20 years of progress in improving the health of the american people the wellbeing and economic security of millions of americans would be jeopardized my fundamental concern with the reagan budget is that it proposes to shift or eliminate altogether every federal program which provides health care services to americans while it does nothing to address the underlying problem of health care inflation the reagan budget fails to recognize that it is inflation in health costsnot federal health programswhich has created the funding problems we face today last year alone health care costs increlused by 14 2 percentor 29 billion nationwide annual health expenditures by every american exceed 1 000 a person or 4 000 for a family of four hospital costs are now increasing at the record rate of 19 7 percent per year a day in the hospital now costs an average of 270 and is projected to exceed 500 by 1985 and nearly 1 000 by 1990 instead of confronting this unbridled inflation the reagan administration has proposed to limit federal ex penditures by merely shifting the cost and responsibility for providing adequate health care services to the states localities and individual providers health care services to needy children and our most vulnerable elderly and disadvantaged citizens will be cut while health care inflation in creases national health care spending by tens of billions health care to the poor will be rationed while the basic faults of the entire health care systempublic and privateare ignored the reagan administration has charted its new course for health care without examining the impact of its proposed actions and without consulting with the states and private groups asked to assume additional costs and responsibilities let us briefly review the reagan proposals first federal costs would be reduced by limiting expenditures on care for the poor the federal commitment to share with the states in the cost of care for the indigent under medicaida 15year partnershipwould be replaced with a ceiling on federal financial involvement the states would be left with the impossible task of meeting the needs that exceed the federal contribution or reducing vital health and longterm careservices this cutdespite all the talk about a safety netis targeted on the very poorest of our people the proposal to replace many existing categorical health programs with block grants to the states would also reduce federal costs at the expense of the poor and underserved funding for a wide range of health mental health and prevention activities would be reduced by 25 percent and the states given total discretion to decide how or whether to continue liny of these programs block grants would slash dozens of essential health services including prenatal care immunizations family planning and drug abuse counseling as the budget committee reports these programs provide valuable health care for poor and medically underserved populations they could not absorb a 25 reduction in funding without drastically reducing medical services second the reagan budiget proposes to abolish two existing federal programns designed to limit health care costshealth planning and professional standards review organizations while these programs are not perfect they are our only tools to control costs locally based and staffed by thousands of volunteers the two programs are now beginning to work the reagan budget would abolish these programs and give the nations health industry a blank check on the federal treasury an unplanned unreviewed system is the pserfect prescription for excess beds unnecessary care and even greater health care inflation the final reagan health policy is a heavy dose of rhetroic about a competitive health care system beyond rhetoric however the rdminlstration has provided no concrete details on how it plans to force doctors and hospitals to change their current mode of oper ation and whatever the longrange benefits of increased competition it clearly will not limit costs in 1982 or 1983 experience from boston cleveland and denver indicates that years are necessary to establish successful health care plans even the strongest advocates admit that it will take competitive reforms 10 years to control health care costs yet the reagan administration asks us to believe that 12 billion in savings will accrue to medicare over the next 5 years from this undefined proposal the overall effect of the reagan policies are simple to predict if these polivies are adopted the nation will experience highdr health care costs and health services for millions of our citizens will be reduced rather than improved without any effort to restrain costs federal state and local governments will all laceever increasing expenses forexisting benefits and existing beneficiaries private industry will see billions of dollars otherwise available for plant modernization envirornental improvement and better wages and benefits devoted to higher and higher health insurance premiums but most importantly continuing increases in costs for our existing programs will inhibitif not precludeefforts to improve services for all people further efforts to improve effective preventive care for mothers and children will be deferred medicare benefits which already pay less than one half of the healtb~care costs for the elderly will continue to erode year by year the more than 20 million americans now without adequate health insurance and the 15 to 25 million of our people who live in rural and innercity iunderserved areas will see fewer doctors and hospitals available to serve them higher costs and reduced carethat is the message of

phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty injustice and other societal ills which cloud any efforts to provide equal opportunities for each and

wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who

overdue once again this body is unfortunately subjected to crisis management but there is no need to cause a crisis for some elderly who are particularly dependent on the minimum social security

consensus bill i think this can now be termed a bipartisan and noncontroversial bill and i am pleased to join with my colleagues in supporting its passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to vote for the motion to suspend the rules and pass the

decisioi is made on where to locate a nuclear waste repository it is incredible to me that tho paramount issue of the health and safety of our citizens is not assured in this bill health and safety are not even given one fraction of the protection which the congress afforded the snail darter in that landmark legislation of the last congress that is why i am offering my amendment which states simply that a nuclear waste repository cannot be located adjacent to a 1 mile by i mile area containing at least 1 000 individuals this is not a parochial question this square mile area could be a section of the city of clevelend ohio or a town within the state of mississippi my amendment is not intended to make distinctions among regions of the country what it does is to make a universal statement that the rights of people are primary in deciding where to locate nuclear waste facilities just as they have been in deciding where to locate atomic reactors the population language in the bill before us falls short of providing that safeguard by focusing on the surface facility on a repository site instead of the buried highly radioactive waste itself the population language in h r 7187 states that a site will be disqualifled from development as a repository if its surface facility is located adjacent to a square mile area of 1 000 persons or more first you must understand that a surface facility is the aboveground structurea plywood shack will dowhich sits atop a vertical ground shaft leading to the underground area where nuclear waste will be stored you must understand as well that no nuclear waste will be enclosed in that surface facility that shack from which this bill professes to protect the public nuclear waste however will be stored in horizontal tunnels extending out from that vertical shaftunderground tunnels that will extend laterally in all directions as a result radioactive material could end up not i or 2 miles away from a populated area but directly underneath the residents of a city clearly this is not congress legislative intent and r am offering my amendment to clarify that the final resting place of these contaminated materialsnot a benign surface facilityis the focus of concern the senate companion to the legislation we are considering today s 1662 which was approved earlier contains no population density standard leaving doe to decide questions of safety i urge you not to leave this decision to others since the development of nuclear power during world war if populatlion has been the primary consideration in deciding where to locate atomic facilities in fact the nuclear regulatory commission has declined to license several powerplants because of their proximity to populated areas now when we come to the question of where to discard our highly radioactive nuclear wastes are we going to abandon 40 years of prudent practice and say that population does not count within the past year the office of technology assessment released a widely respected study which concluded that the most difficult aspect of the whole repository program is the fact that the public has lost confidence in the federal governments ability to effectively manage the nuclear waste disposal program what do you think will be the effect on this matter of public confidence if the population question is ignored in this legislation the vote before you is on the question of protecting the rights of citizens in all communities and cities as an integral part of setting national policy for nuclear waste disposal under this legislation five candidate sites will be recommended to the president by doe in 1984 for selection as a repository if you have not already had the opportunity to do so i strongly urge you to study the maps which are available off the floor which show the locations where nuclear waste may one day be buried if your communities are not now targeted you may be next you will be prudent to vote cautiously on tails basic safety standard for protecting the public members might say that this does not affect them but 1 urge them to take a look at that roap showing different geological formations i think they will see that probably as many as 30 of the states could have an area that could be touched and some of these formations are in the northeast running into pennsylvania and new york and the midwest some of them are out west and some of them are in the south all i am saying here is that we should pay attention to population density and we should say clearly what the general area and the population level

died in a tragic automobile accident known by so many of us in congress for his whirlwind dynamism and tireless unswerving commitment to ending world hunger harry chapin inspired an invigorating confidence that it was possible for policies and programs to be changed that the energies resources and great talents of our nation could be mobilized to breathe a fresh new life into the great humanitarian principles for which we want our nation to stand in one of his many finely crafted probing ballads harry queried now if a man tried to take his time on earth and prove before he died what one mans life could be worth well i wonder what would happen to this world during his short lifetime harry proved to so many people what his life was worth he was vision confidence inspiration unbridled energy and selfless dedication to others and his life matteredhe made a difference he constantly reminded us that hundreds of millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition that hunger makes every day for them a struggle whether or not their plight makes the nightly news or the morning paper as harry reviewed the cold statistics of hunger they became even more dramatic he reminded us that hunger is most vicious when it stalks the young that 100 000 children go blind each year because of vitamin deficiencies that in some poorer countries almost half the children die before reaching the age of 5 mostly from nutritionrelated diseases and that among the survivors handicaps of learning behavior and work capacity are widespread due to inadequate diets and recurring illness harry would repeat to himself and to millions of others that these conditions did not have to exist and people listened and they read and they learned that we do have the basic technological knowhow and resources to alleviate the hunger problem it became plain to those who began to familiarize themselvbs with the many dimensions and facets of the hunger problem that our task is formidable indeed but that is where harry came in many of my colleagues will attest to the fact that is was difficult if not impossible to avoid becoming totally enveloped in harrys electric enthusiasm he sparked a realization that the job was not going to get any easier that the time had come to roll up our sleeves to construct a comprehensive strategy against hunger more finely tuning those programs with a demonstrated record of success and terminating those programs which actually exacerbated the hunger problem i first met harry during the summer of 1977 he had come to washington seeking support for an idea he and his wife sandy had conceived creating a presidential commission on world hunger to find ways that our nation could develop more effective policies to combat hunger and malnutrition more comfortable in the jeans and casual shirts and shoes his fans recognized him in harry had come to town in a conservative threepiece suit that lobbying suit as harry liked to call it was to get quite a workout during the next year in between the hundreds of concerts he performedmore than half to benefit the hungerfighting activities of his world hunger year and food policy center organizationshe would return to washington to lobby for his hunger commission singlehandedly harry stormed the capitol along with me harry persuaded our former colleague rick nolan and senators pat leaiiy and bob dole to introduce a resolution urging the president to establish the commission he soon generated enough interest in the conmmission to attract 265 cosponsors in the house and 51 in the senate the presidential commission on world hunger was finally established in 1978 during the course of the next 2 years harry never missed a commission meeting often exhausted after a night of performing at a concert and the logistical nightmare of grabbing any available means of transportation to get back to washington for the commission meeting the next day harry nevertheless injected a spirit of infectious enthusiasm into those meetings he was the conscience of the commission everurging us to explore the deeply rooted causes of hunger and prodding us to produce a final report which did not equivocate did not pull any punches in detailing those actions our nation would have to take if the hunger problem was to be resolved harry chapin led our commissions efforts to involve the public in our deliberations and to explore ways to mobilize public opinion in support of comprehensive policy initiatives against hunger the commissions report did not reflect unanimous support for each of its findings or conclusions with differences of opinion noted in our report but we did provide the chief executive and the american public with some good thoughtful recommendations producing a document which has served as a vehicle to stimulate muchneeded public discussion about the dimensions of and threats posed by world hunger the end of the commission did not end harry chapins commitment to ending hunger it was but a new beginning meeting with him on a number of occasions during this past year harry expressed his everpresent concern that congress and the administration commit itself to developing new hunger policies he continued to pound upon the doors of staid indifference to the global suffering and instability that hunger breeds i always had to listen very carefully when harry spoke because he could pack into 5 minutes more thoughtful innovative ideas than anyone i have known in a conversion he was a master at conceptually changing gears launching a fusillade of incisive questions comments and proposals on a variety of topics it was as if he were afraid he would not have the time to discuss and to do all those things that truly mattered to him there is an empty space now where once there was boundless energy and unfettered contagious enthusiasm calling for an end to world hunger harry once asked and if our future lies on the final line are we brave enough to see the signals and the signs resolving the complicated global problem of hunger will not be an easy task it will be that much more difficult with the absence of a prodding insistent force such as harry chapin but world hunger does place our future on the final line harry took the time to see the signals and the signs of an awesome menacing problem which if left to fester would visit an unprecedented catastrophe on us all he bravely confronted powerful institutional impediments to change and individuals revering the status quo he underscored the urgent need for courageous decisions if our nation were to act against hunger while the best opportunities for success still existed we greatly miss harry chapin our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to his wife sandy and their five children jamie jason jond jenny and josh during this grievous period but those of us who harry touched so deeply who remember the hopefilled strains of his songs who recall his unfailing commitment to others will not let harrys vision and dream be forgotten i urge my colleagues to find in the spirit of harry chapin their own determination to channel the necessary resources

proposal is outlined as follows the administration has agreed to add 30 million to aeronautics in each fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983 without changing the total from the presidents budget the reductions in fiscal year 1982 would be taken by relatively minor reductions less than 1 percent 20 million from space shuttle and operations 7 million from space science and applications and 3

development and procurement 7 million from science andapplications 2 million from space research and technology and 5 million from tracking and data acquisition in light of the present status of the

administration economists of all people should have learned the lesson from franklin delano roosevelt when he said we have known that heedless selfinterest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics it is bad economics to fatten the rich even more than they are already bloated it is also bad short and longterm politics this administration is riding into the sunset of political oblivion with its economic brand exposed in full view to the american people k that brand spells greed and uncontrollable greed is exactly what we are seeing as the hallmark of this administration and its misguided and selfdestructive economic policies may i first talk about corporate tax subsidies the combination of accelerated depreciation leasing of tax credits plus investment credits means that all of corporate america will soon reach the zero rate of taxation already achieved by such profitable corporations as occidental petroleum ltv and burlington northern rather than helping directly those companies which should receive tax relief these budgets are helping out very profitable corporations at an extraordinary cost to the treasury the taxpayers and to the future economic recovery of this nation those special interests who gathered in washington for the lear jet weekend may find that in aiming to raid the treasurythey really ended up shooting themselves in the corporate foot the feeding frenzy generated around the federal tax trough degenerated into an exercise in timelapse cannibalism their tax benefits are costing the nation revenues it does not haveare hiking interest rates and the deficit to ungodly levelsand helping kill the recovery needed to generate their own profits and sustain healthy economic growth and the creation of jobs for the millions upon millions of anericans out of work besides reducing the revenue hemorrhageinduced by the tax benefit given to corporations and the wealthy last yearanother way in which we could cut the deficit is by repealing reducing or delaying the third year tax cut however neither the tiny net tax saving of the middle income nor the several thousands realized by those with income in six figures are justification for the economic p nalties we will all pay through persistent high interest rates if the third year tax cut is left untouched repeal or reductions in the third year tax cut are essential if money managers and investors are to be convinced of our determination to reduce deficits it is far better to adjust the third year tax cut ant thus lower interest rates and create jobs than to maintain a tax cut which guarantees that the unemployed do not even have incomes on which to pay taxes defense spending is the third area where significant federal revenues can be saved the president wants to increase defense spending by from 13 to 18 percent above inflation the house budget committee would increase defense spending by 5 percent above leflation while the committee proposaland otherscut actual spending for 1983 between 10 and 15 billion they are really merely nibbling at this mammoth fiscal cheese i maintain that before we have a truly credible defenseand one which we can sustain without seriously eroding the economywe must repair the economic damage this administrations policies have caused to our great productive economic machine better to reduce defense spending by 50 to 60 billion than risk continued and deepening recession of the economy while experiencing runaway inflation and horrendous cost overruns in the defense sector defense spending can and must be reduced significantly beyond what any of these budgets before us propose a delay of several years will not have the russians launching their strategic missiles at us assuredly cuba will not strike out at us our present military strength is such that no nation on earth would dare risk assured mutual destruction defense spending ranging from 191 to 214 billion as proposed by the various substitutes is just too high during this period of economic crisis i feel sure our allies in nato and around the world would feel far more secure s9eing a unitedstates economy in good healthwith rational interest rates with greater production and productivity and with a dollar valued to facilitate rather than dampen world trade as the saying goes when the american economy has a cold the world economy catches pneumonia these three revenue sources must be tapped the american worker running out of unemployment benefits has lost patience with this president and this administration the congress must bite the bullet and present the american people with a budget which will foster economic growth and the creation of jobs for the mllions and millions out of work we must repeal or adjust the tax benefits passed out last year during a moment of fiscal drunkenness on the part of this administration and the congresstax benefits which i happened to have voted for unfortunate ly we must repeal or adjust the third year tax cutwhich again i voted for unfortunately we must reduce defense spending to a level consistent with economic realities we cannot accept continuing deficits in the 100 billion plus renge in spite or what our republican savior the gentleman from new york has said interest rates will not come down if deficits remain at current or higher levels we must secure the revenues necessary to achieve that and the areas i have indicated are those which i believe will produce increased revenues without cutting off economic recovery good government costs moneyby good government i mean that which helps peoplenot hurts them we should be investing in a government that truly cares for those who cannot care for themselves to have carelessly defaulted in his leadership responsibilities on the budget indicates that this president is greatly at odds with the view the vast majority of americans hold of the american government and its responsibilities i believe this president and those around him truly misread the american people they listen too much to the rhetorical grumblings and not enough to what the people really feel the american people instinctively understand what teddy roosevelt and his cousin franklin talked about when they used the word national the american people want a government that works and not one that is to be dismantled to oblige the greed and ideological liturgy of destruction espoused by this presidents wealthy cronies i have voted against all substitutes put before the house i shall continue to vote against others yet to be discussed the american people deserve better than the alternatives presented here for our deliberations and decision these budgets are unacceptable these things i believe"], [0.9293035864830017, 0.9293035864830017, 0, "i move the

more than that recommended by the administrationand far less relief for the american taxpayertax relief that is universally recognized as critical to restoring incentives for both labor and capitaland essentini if we are to foster in creased productivity savings investment and enterprise it is perhaps even more amazing that because of reports that the economy is improving moderatelyif you can believe the economic indicators issued this weekwe can now somehow miraculously allow our federal government to grow to the astronomical level of 715 billion it appears that the budget committee only listens to those that tell it what it wants to hearlistening to any faint voice that somehow will continue to justify the runaway growth of the federal government that in a nutshell is the issue before us how big should the federal government be in the years aheadand who should we listen toas we make the decisionsas we set the budgetthat establishes the size and the growth rate for the federal government in thp years ahead it appears that the budget committee does not want to listen to president reagan the leader our country chose last november he wants to hold the federal government downlimit its growth with a budget of less than 689 billion it appears that the committee does not want to listen to the american peopleour constituents who have time and time again expressed themselves in favor of limiting the growth of the federal government well perhaps i can persuade my colleagues to listen to the voice of the future generation 19 years ago the federal budget was scarcely 100 billion who then would have believed that today the house budget co~mmittee would be seeking a 715 billion budget who would have been elected in support of such a budget 19 years hence well who today wants the budget in the year 2000 19 years away to surpass 2 860 billion if we allow the current budget committee proposal to pass and continue its level of growth even at what it calls these conservative levela then thats thh budget for the year 2000 2 860 billion i but if we adopt the presidents budget and escalate thi ough the year 2000 it the level of the 1982 proposal then the budget in the year 2000 will be less than half the federal budget woud become less than half if we allow the budget committee level to pass the question is clearly what will be the size of the federal government for the future generations well the choice is very clear we must support our president and slow the growth of the federal government or else we will continue the programs of the past two decades the lattagranmn bipartisan substitute is the best vehicle now available to accomplish the critical goals of cutting inflation creating new jobs increasing family takehome pay and
