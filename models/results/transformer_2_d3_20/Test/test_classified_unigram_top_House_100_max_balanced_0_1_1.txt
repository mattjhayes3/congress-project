reflected in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding americas most vulnerable"], [0.0016574859619140625, 0.9983425140380859, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i join with so many of my other colleagues in thanking him both for providing this time and for the thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would otherwise have known without the opportunity and privilege of calling sala burton a very close and special friend"], [0.001710355281829834, 0.9982896447181702, 1, "he has been called a crusader without violence recognized as an astute man of the cloth a noted distinguished noble laureate and a prince of peace dr kings lagacy has all the trappings of nobility and royalty he faithfully lived a life of courage charity and moral bearing he showed all people that wise thoughtful and strong leadership can bring about change through the use of nonviolence of all the materials ive ever read regarding martin luther king an article written by coleman mccarthy a nationally syndicated colunist seemed to best put his life into perspective the writer said nothing of kings greatness can be understood without first seeing the reasons for his absolute commitment to the belief that the aftermath of violence is bitterness the aftermath of nonviolence is reconciliation he further says had king not taught and practiced that his national holiday would become as hollow as the one for george washingtons birthdayan excuse for the department stores to hold a sale kings holiday the writer says is a call to conscience not commerce it is important then that we remember dr kingmemorialize him perpetuate him and pay tribute to his leadership of a movement which touched the social conscience of this nation and changed the course of history martin loved his nation he loved the people of this nation and the world he even died for the nation he loved this nation and its people so much that he inspired a vision and a dream for the nation his dream was a simple dream uncomplicated and unencumbered in essence he believed and demanded that america live up to its creedthat all men are created equal the course of american history has been a relentless push by peoples of all races creeds and colors for america to live up to that creed that is why dr kings birthday celebration is so important and why i stand here today with great frustration knowing that the mission of dr king is far from finished this country has yet to meet its true creed that all men are created equal the recognition of dr kings life and death should not merely be symbolic it should be a living example of how our daily lives should be conducted america can and will i hope someday realize the dream the dream will come true when every american can work commensurate with his ability and training when every child receives quality education regardless of his race or status in lifewhen every american can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood america will not see the dream until black mothers no longer die in childbirth at a rate four times as great as white mothers we will see martins dream only when children can replace their tattered clothing with new garments and senior citizens are no longer required to choose between eating and heating we will fully appreciate the dream when 50 million people no longer go to bed hungry and undernourished his dream will come true when the slums are destroyed when americans attack injustice and prejudice with the same determination they attack communism and terrorism the administrations budget proposes cuts and elimination of basic support programs for the working poorsuch as educational loans the food stamp program legal services corporation and mass transit the 100th congress will grapple with the grammrudman budget deficit reduction act which will have a devastating impact on many programs designed for the nations poor and disadvantaged dr king isnt here with us today but if he were he would see the rise in defense spending support for the contras and yet would find many of the programs he so fervently and aggressively fought for wiped out at the stroke of a pen but if he were alive today he would be in the forefront lobbying congress in an effort to remove these programs from the presidents chopping block when dr king delivered his famous i have a dream speech in 1963 the unemployment rate for black workers was 10 8 percent today although the overall unemployment rate dropped in december to below 7 percent for black americans and teenagers it remains at a shamefully high rate for black males it was 14 8 percent and for black teenagers it was 40 percent in dr kings lifetime america needed a war on poverty in 1987 we still need one a congressional report indicates that the percentage of american children whose families have incomes below the poverty line has now increased to 22 2 percent the study further found that half of poor children live in femaleheaded oneparent families for children in black single femaleheaded families where the mother is under 30 and did not complete high school the poverty rate was 92 8 percent a recent report released by the unitedstates department of health and human services reconfirmed our worst fears about the disparity in the health status of black and white americans the report concluded that more than 60 000 excess deaths occur each year among blacks and minorities largely because they are easier prey for disease and violence dr king loved all people be they black white jew or gentile certainly the human rights problems that exist today in not only south africa but russia afghanistan and central america would be of great concern to dr king so similar are these situations to those that existed throughout much of this nation that dr king would attempt to prevail upon the leaders of those countries to bring about dignity and equality for all mankind dr king so fervently believed in the brotherhood of man he showed us the similarities between us and most importantly that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere each year then when we recognize this man it seems to me that we should come together to think reason and act just as he did dr kings legacy challenges each of us to use the power across america and around the worid to pursue equal justice due process of the law and true liberation for all people while we have made progress since the death of dr king the dream has yet to come true as long as inequality exists as long as injustice exists and until we truly become a land of brotherhood with equal justice for all the struggles which dr king had the goals that he set for us will continue the dream will come true when every american can proclaim in a loud clear voice that they are proud of this country and brotherhood is the hallmark of human relations lest not the dream be deferred we should use this day this hour and this year to reaffirm the ideas and the dream he had for america the struggle must continue there is a great challenge ahead for america and for people

prudent use of safety belts it also is a very special day for the many law enforcement safety automotive education insurance and public interest organizations who have supported numerous efforts to promote safety belt use and to increase the publics awareness of the advantages of buckling up i wish to thank congressman dymally congressman ford and the house leadership for helping to expedite the passage on september 15 of house joint resolution 338 the resolution my good friend and colleague congressman bud shuster and i introduced requesting the president to designate october 15 as national

president to sign this important resolution many of my colleagues including myself have been involved in automobile accidents were safety belts have proven the difference between life and death according to the national highway traffic safety administration the probability of being involved in a motor vehicle injury accident during a 75year lifetime is better than 86 percent nhtsa also has provided some startling facts about automobile related fatalities and injuries approximately 3 528 000 people were injured in traffic injuries in 1985 there were 23 192 passenger car fatalities and 5 763 light truck fatalities in 1985 on average one life is lost every 12 minutes in traffic accidents in 1985 91 percent of the occupants o killed in auto accidents were not wearing their safety belts unrestrained automobile occupants were 40 percent more likely to be injured in an auto accident and twice as likely to require hospitalization as restrained occupants the facts on the record demonstrate that safety belts save lives and prevent injuries in the past few years more than half our nations state legislatures have made substantial process in enacting mandatory seatbelt use laws since 1984 29 states and the district of columbia have enacted mandatory safety belt use laws each of these laws has the objective of reducing deaths and injuries in motor vehicle crashes the fact is that virtually every study produced on the effects of increased belt use indicates that lap and shoulder safety belts can reduce the risk of fatal or serious injury by between 45 and 55 percent these laws work safety belt use has dramatically increased currently safety belt use in states that have enacted belt use laws averages about 45 percent ranging from 78 percent in north carolina to 23 percent in kansas the unitedstates department of transportations center for statistics and analysis has documented the success of increased safety belt use in terms of lives saved and injuries prevented among front seat passenger vehicle occupants safety belts saved about 2 200 lives in 19861 750 in states with belt use laws among front seat passenger vehicle occupants safety belts prevented about 25 000 moderate to critical injuries in 1986 20 000 in states with belt use laws at the current use level in belt law states45 percentbelts would have saved 3 100 lives if all states had belt laws in 1986 at the high use levels achieved in some other countries85 percentbelts could have saved 10 000 lives if all states had belt laws in 1986 the national highway traffic safety administration also indicates that safety belt use has dramatically increased since 1982 nhtsas yearly national safety belt use survey of 19 cities has documented a safety belt use rate increase from 11 percent in 1982 to 42 percent in the first half of 1987 an interesting fact in this survey was that among the seven cities without belt laws belt use was only 27 percent among the 12 cities with belt laws in effect belt use was 51 percent an important aspect of safety belt use that cannot be overlooked is child safety seats in passenger vehicles these statistics are worth looking at the national center for statistics and analysis reports that among children under 4 child seats saved about 200 lives in 1986 with 100 percent correct use child seats could save about 500 lives per year child seat use among children 4 and under in the 19 cities survey was 72 percent in 1986 it goes without saying that one of the most important aspects of educating the public about the advantages of increased safety belt and child restraint use is the active involvement of the many law enforcement educational industrial state medical consumer insurance and safety organizations in promoting this sound policy objective all too often the efforts of these organizations and individuals go unnoticed their wide range of support for national safety belt use day and other activities associated with vehicle safety programs is testimony to the national recognition of the critical importance of safety belt use the good work of these organizations are a genuine part of the success we celebrate today for that reason these organizations should be commended for recognizing the importance of buckling up their tireless work exemplifies the need to pursue this cause with enthusiasm and vigor so that

what the previous speaker in the well said about motives all of us i think share the same goal seek the same goal in central america we have a difference of what strategy might accomplish that goal we all want peace and protection against real threats to our security i think we ought to understand that when we engage in these discussions there is a peace plan underway in central america and the question is what do we do here and how does it affect that peace plan some of us feel very strongly that to provide lethal aid which would derail the peace plan will be very counterproductive to us and to the people in the region we need to do what we can to give that peace plan a chance to work the real question before the house of representatives is what are we going to send to central america are we going to continue to send guns to guerrillas and guns to governments or are we finally going to begin to send what our neighbors so desperately need food medicine and clothing the kind of help one neighbor would normally give to another neighbor are we also going to help pursue peace not try to derail it the proposal before us offers two fresh approacnes and combines them as a transit or a bridge to peace for a short time period we say to the contra soldiers that we will provide you with sustenance needed to maintain life we have a responsibility for this peaceful aid this shortterm survival assistance of food and medicine to the young men and women in the hills while the final step of being taken in a peace process to provide lasting peace so that these folks can come back and join their families but more than this sustenance to the contras there is another part of this package providing aid to the children of that region the second part of the package is the childrens survival fund of genuine humanitarian aid which i helped write it recognizes the thousands and thousands of children who are victims of this war the children who have lost their limbs children who have known tile agony of burns and bullets who are hungry or homeless we need to start the healing process to bind up the wounds of war we need to start with these children the childrens survival fund will provide basic food medicine and shelter for the children victims of this war prosthetic devices for amputees treatment for the burn victims lifesaving immunization and oral rehydration therapy for victims and orphans during a trip to that region some while ago i met a young woman in a refugee camp on the border between nicaragua and honduras she was holding her 6monthold son in her arms who was desperately ill it appeared he would probably not live the mother asked for help and there was not anything i could do and there was precious little medical help in that refugee camp the tears from that sick child i saw that day are our tears too they are tears that congress should not and cannot ignore in this child survival package we finally begin converting what would have been lethal aid to assistance that will give hope and give life to the children of that region let me make one final point in many cases these children live in refugee camps they do not understand or care about the difference between democracy and communism but they know the difference between happiness and sadness they know what suffering pain and injury is i want them also to know what healing is and what opportunity is if we take these steps for both the contras and the war victims in this bill i believe we will promote regional peace and frankly we will help tens of thousands of innocent victims we will be taking two steps the first step and the right step i think the congress can be proud of that again we share the same goal the goal is peace and democracy in that region and the promotion at genuine hemispheric security i think we are close to that goal what we do in this package can assist that goal immeasurably we keep the contras until a peace settlement we help the children and we move this region toward peace i am proud to support this package i would al o insert for the record a more complate statement on the elements on the child survival package section 10 of this resolution children survival assistance is the most re ii 661 markable and important part of this legislation the intent of this section should be clear aid to children as defined under this section is to be distributed based on need not on politics our aim is to provide effective assistance as rapidly and efficiently as possible to children in need and to convert military aid into lifesaving help the language of this section allows the agency for international development the flexibility and responsibility to determine the precise amounts to allocate to each of the named types of assistance and designated groups with the understanding that the aid is for and only for innocent children who need these types of assistance the aid therefore should be allocated equitably by aid

protect the american samoan tropical forest and its numerous archeological natural cultural and fish and wildlife resources particularly the flying foxes the park would encompass approximately 8 200 acres including large areas on the islands of tau and tutuila and a small coastal area on ofu when this legislation was introduced in june of this year i was pleased to join as an original cosponsor as i recognized the importance of preserving tropical forests and their unique wildlife i have been fortunate to deal with insular issues affecting samoa since i fiist came to congress my work has taken me to samoa where i have witnessed the beautiful and diverse flora and fauna of the islands and coastal areas i was equally impressed by the tospitable and proud people of the territory of american samoa they have good reason to be proud the tropical islands of samoa are an often overlooked scenic natural resource of the united states american samoa has one of only three tropical rain forests under unitedstates jurisdiction puerto rico has the beautiful el yunque hawaii has the highly vulnerable forest in the hawaii volcanoes national park and american samoa has the third the diminution of tropical forests worldwide is accelerating with numerous adverse impacts on our environment there exists a considerable amount of interest in the congress as well as elsewhere in the government and among private organizations to stem stop or even reverse the decline of world tropical forests it appears to me that we should first do whatever we can to preserve our own tropical forests a very important factor in sustaining the tropical forests of samoa is a small and often misunderstood animal pteropus samoenis or flying fox a symbiotic relationship exists between these little animals and the tropical forests they need each other to survive the flying fox helps to pollinate the trees and the forest provides safe refuge it is anticipated that a national park would help protect the forests and the flying foxes so that both will continue to thrive and contribute to the environment in our exuberance to establish a park and preserve the forest we have been careful to remember first and foremost the people of samoa they know their islands better than anyone the culture of samoa revolves around the land and respect for nature in agreeing to the cession of the samoan islands of tutuila aunuu and the manua group the chiefs requested that the indigenous ownership of lands by samoans be preserved therefore the legislation provides for the secretary of the interior and the governor of american samoa to enter into a 50year lease of the lands and waters in the park with the option to extend the lease on or before its expiration if the lease is not extended the administration of the park would be transferred to the governor the secretary and the governor would negotiate the amount of the lease payments which would be disbursed by the governor to the villages and families located within the park the high court of samoa would determine the amount of the payments to individuals thus the park would be established without federal ownership of the land prior to the establishment of unitedstates jurisdiction in samoa in 1900 the samoan people had inhabited the islands for thousands of years the people had long recognized the vulnerability of animal and sea life and had incorporated strict conservation methods as part of their way of life in addition it was customary for the chiefs to monitor the population sizes of various species of fish once the number of fish neared the threshold of endangering the continuing viability of the species a temporary ban on taking that type of fish would be instituted the ban which is called tapu in samoan would not be lifted until the chiefs determined that an adequate population base existed given the samoans historical concern for the environment it is not surprising that there is widespread support in samoa for a park that would continue to preserve the islands natural resources under h r 4818 the park will also seek to potect the traditions and customs of samoa subsistence farming and subsistence reef fishing as have been traditionally used in the past will be allowed to continue in addition the access to park areas will provide for the traditional subsistence harvesting of breadfruit coconuts yams kava wild fruits and vegetables and plants for medicinal purposes the park will also permit the careful and customarily limited extraction of native trees to be used in traditional samoan houses and ware as land in samoa is such an important issue the legislation provides that the boundaries of the proposed park area will be clearly defined and mutually agreed to by the governor and respective villages before publication of the park maps h r 4818 also requires the secretary of the interior to develop a program to train native american samoans to work in the park and to extend a hiring preference to these individuals to ensure that the park employees are familiar with the samoan islands the people language and traditions i am confident that there are adequate native american samoans as clearly defined in the bill qualified to meet the staffing needs of the park the real employment opportunities that the national park offers however will be generated from business established in samoa to support the increase of visitors the villages families and individuals of american samoa can provide tours food and lodging as well as other services to visitors to the national park of samoa a great deal of time and effort have been invested by many individuals and organizations to help make the dream of a national park of american samoa to become a reality the national park service conducted an excellent study and recently transmitted a superb draft report to congress with recommendations for the park the chairman of the subcommittee mr vento certainly deserves recognition for his hard work on this legislation as well the subcommittee traveled to samoa last year to inspect the areas of the proposed park hold a hearing on the issue and moot with several of the high chiefs and local officials to obtain their views concerning the park i would clearly be remiss if i did not commend dr paul cox and dr merlin tuttle renowned experts on the flying fox and tropical forests dr cox and dr tuttle along with mr verne read have worked extremely hard for several years to achieve their goal of creation of a national park in samoa i am pleased we have boon able to assist them in their dedicated efforts i believe we have a unique opportunity to join with the people of samoa in the proservation of the third major tropical forest of the united states by the establishment of the national park of american samoa the establishment of the park under h r 4818 would assist in the conservation of samoas wildlife such as the flying fox and the variegated

our bill had 56 18 billion in total obligational authority and this year it is down to 42 512 billion the funding levels of this bill are within the proposed levels in the presidents budget 27 million below the presidents request and 1 986 million below the 302b allocation and the outlay allocation the bill is in line with last years budget summit agreement three major programs that were expanded this year include the women infants and children nutrition program the food safety inspection service and tie food and drug administration first the wic program has been increased by nearly 127 million for fiscal year 1989 above the 1988 level and is more than 52 million above the presidents request this program has proven itself over and over again as one of the most effective methods of inprovlng our nations future citizens health and prosperity unfortunately funding limitations have prevented us from being able to serve even half of those eligible for the program wic is not the only nutrition program other nutrition programs help disseminate information vital to our citizens health through the human nutrition information service and send food for peace to africa asia south america and other regions of the world where there is a shortage of food we have provided funds to help serve nutritious meals for both the young and the elderly of the united states through programs like the school lunch program and the elderly feeding programs under title iii of the older americans act of 1965 second the food safety and inspection service has been increased by more than 12 9

americans enjoy a nutritious abundant food supply we must be ever vigilant to ensure that our meat and poultry products are the best and safest possible third the food and drug administrations appropriation las been increased by more than 31 million to 481 844 000 for fiscal year 1989 the primary goal of the fda is to protect the consumer by setting standards on food testing drug safety conducting research on health hazards and helping to promote orphan drug development although may important issues are addressed in this bill none is more vital than providing assistance to our

and ranchers or 11 percent of the farm population since 1981 on the other hand you and i have both heard how much better off our agricultural producers were in 1987 the united states had record net cash farm income totalling 57 billion in 1987 compared to 52 billion in 1986 and 47 3 billion in 1985 estimates for 1988 earlier this year indicated an income in the 50 to 55 billion range but that was before the drought began to take affect and this level cannot be sustained and will fall in 1988 but for now the good news is that the ccc needs only 8 8 billion to restore prior years lossesa substantial drop from 14 3 billion of a year agoanother positive sign of the improvement in the agricultural economy last year also dramatic increased exports are helping to reduce total spending on agriculture the number of farm workers in the civilian labor force is 2 75 million s of april 1988 when added to the 20plus million workers who support the production and delivery of food and fiber to our citizens you have the largest single industry in the united states agriculture employs as many workers as the transportation steel and automobile industries combined one of the reasons our country has been able to achieve so much is so little of our family income is used to buy food in fact our families spend the smallest percent of their income for food than families in any other country in the world only 12 3 percent for all food and 7 9 percent for food purchased for use at home for every dollar spent on food last year only 25 cents went to the producer while athome expenditures for food averaged a 31 cents return to the farm away from home food purchases only returned 17 cents this clearly indicates consumers ability and willingness to spend more for food for conv ience and in

minds and bodies and second are better able to obtain a quality education what is the current status of our child nutrition programs as the vice chairman of the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity limited resources to the end that we meet our commitment to providing for the nutritional wellbeing and improved educational opportunities afforded to all of our children what is at stake has been eloquently stated in the current offering of letters for women infants and children in the usa being conducted by bread for the world children are our future au of them while adequate diets wilu not compensate for the great differences in access to opportunity between those who have and those who do not it is a start food can enable some children to survive and many others to make better use of educational and economic

it should be required to make every effort to complete its work by april 15 if developments so required it could ask the house for more time there is no justification for the holdup this is an investigation of arms sales to iran and diversion of related fundsthis is not an investigation of the past 6 years of the reagan administration we should finish by april not drag on until october can you imagine what the reaction of this house would have been if the president had said were looking into the matter but we wont let the american people know until october the resolution also defines an outlandishly broad scope for the investigation the issue facing the country is the iran initiative including arms sales and the disposition of the money generated by those sales if the majority wants a general review of the administrations support for freedom fighters around the world under the reagan doctrine or the activities of friendly countries the standing committees of the house are the appropriate forums the iran select committee should focus quickly and effectively upon the matters at issue which concern the american peoplethe iran initiative iran arms sales and what happened to the money paid for the arms moreover it approaches an abuse of congressional power to authorize the iran committee to look into the tax returns of americans all the way back to 1980 the resolution also sets a poor example for spending taxpayers money the resolution provides for openended spending the house at least ought to set an initial budget ceiling for the committee if events so required the committee could seek more money from the house later the most grave concern is that the resolution fails to provide the necessary protection for national security secrets the resolution grants the committee a right of access to such secrets as communications intercepts intelligence funds transactions and national security council proceedings the committee may need access to relevant parts of such material to do its job but the resolutior should mandate the protection for such secrets equivalent to that required for the intelligence committee the resolution should also provide that no committee member or employee of the house can disclose publicly any classified information possessed by the iran committee without the committees approval the committee should not give such approval

damage national security then the information should not be disclosed unless the house votes to approve such disclosure the nation cannot afford another church and pike committee exercise in which leaks damaging to our nations diplomatic and intelligence efforts appear daily in the press on a final matter the answer to a key question has eluded preliminary investigations what happened to the

at that hearing we heard from dr james fletcher the administrator of nasa the general accounting office which had done a study of the issue of development of such a second source and officials of several rocket motor manufacturers based on the record of that hearing i am convinced that competition in the procurement of solid rocket motors could result in both higher quality motors and lower costs of those motors to the government in addition to the cost benefits to the government a second source could assure nasa of a continuing supply of motors if the first supplier for any reason should be unable to deliver the number of motors necessary in the case of solid rocket motors the same company has supplied motors for the space shuttle since 1973 when the original contract was awarded since then there have been several additional buys of rocket motors all from the original supplier it has been reported in the trade press that this supplier will be given additional orders as contract add ons for parts of the new shuttlederived vehicle which will be used to launch the space station in the mid1990s yet there has been no further competition in this procurement as early as 1974only 1 year after the original procurement was negotiatedand several times since then nasa itself has considered development of a second source for these rocket motors for a variety of reasons these plans have never been fully implemented most recently in january 1986 in announcing plans to develop a second source nasa stated its objectives included expansion of the production base and economic benefits to the government the general accounting office testimony before our committee agreed that competition would achieve these results the benefits of competition are clear i support the

eloquent remarks and for the leadership that the gentleman has shown over the years in this issue yes as we all can see if we will allow our eyes and ears and our minds to see another year has come and gone and the cypriot problem persists with no solution to be had it was the early morning hours of july 20 1974 that turkish paratroopers began descending on the island republic on the pretext that they were undertaking a peace operation intended to protect the turkish cypriot minority in the wake of the political turmoil then enveloping the country this socalled peace operation however was codenamed attila and was effectively an unlawful invasion and occupation of an independent country in violation of every tenet of international law custom and behavior the fact is that attila was not a peace operation at all it was an operation undertaken in order to achieve the partitionist plans of the turkish and turkishcypriot people it was indeed successful in meeting that goal for attila and attila ii on august 14 1974 effectively took over almost 40 percent of the territory of the republic while killing thousands of greek cypriots raping others uprooting 200 000 of them from their homes and looting and stealing from the homes and churches that they were forced to leave behind to make matters worse not only were these atrocities carried out but they were carried out with the use of supplies and equipment provided turkey by the united statesin violation of the unitedstates foreign assistance act of 1962 which authorizes the use of american aid solely for defensive purposes thirteen years have passed since that time and the years have seen several initiatives undertaken toward a solution a solution however has not been attained the reason is not that one is unattainable rather the sad reason for the stalemate is that turkey and the turkish cypriots have not negotiated toward a solution in good faith and have in fact taken a series of steps intended to achieve the permanent partion of the republic of cyprus turkey and the turkishcypriot leadership in direct violation of relevant u n resolutions have indeed taken a series of actions subsequent to the 1974 invastion which are aimed at consolidating the occupation and division of the small mediterranean republic facts speak louder than words so i will cite the evidence first and foremost turkey refused and to date still refuses to comply with international requests and pertinent u n resolutions to remove its occupation troops from the republic of cyprus to add insult to injury not only do they refuse to withdraw their troops but turkey has recently begun a military buildup on cyprus in both manpower and equipment to where today there are an estimated 34 000 to 35 000 turkish troops on cyprus with the number of tanks having more than doubled for a total of over 300 furthermore in an effort to further consolidate their illegal presence on the island turkey has moved in more than 60 000 mainland settlers who are threatening to turn the turkish cypriots themselves into a minority while occupying the homes and properties that the greekcypriots were forced to leave behind when they were turned into refugees in their own land in addition turkey and the turkish cypriot leadership is subjecting the greek cypriots to further indignity by systematically and intentionally destroying the christian and hellenic cultural heritage in the turkish occupied part of the island yes the greek cypriots have since the landing of the mainland troops and to this day been subjected to the pillaging theft and destruction of the artifacts and works of art that tell the story of their identity they have seen their ancient churches used as stables and warehouses they have seen their icons and other works of religious art stolen and they have seen their hellenic antiquities sold to private collectors throughout the world in order no doubt to systematically remove any trace of the cultural heritage which represents the national identity of the occupied areas as if these facts were not enough the partitionist aims of the turkish and turkishcypriot leadership were made crystal clear to the world when as recently as november 15 1983 they undertook an attempt to create a new turkish political entity in occupied cyprus yes they declared the northern occupied part of cyprus to be an independent country and called this pseudostate the turkish republic of northern cyprus fortunately law and logic prevailed and the international community almost unanimously withheld their recognition of the pseudostate and criticized the action i say almost unanimously withheld for the one exception and i underline one exception was turkey for turkey was the only country in the world community to grant its recognition to this illegal entity how i ask can turkey possibly pretend that they want and work toward the return of peace and unity to the republic of cyprus when they are a party to such destructive actions to the process how can they pretend to want to work with the u n secretarygeneral to find a workable solution to the situation when they ignore his expressions of concern as well as those of the united states over the military buildup on cyprus that turkey is engaging in by replying as turkish foreign minister halefoglu did on june 6 1987 that the evidence is ridiculous and untrue and that turkey does not have to answer to anyone on the number of troops and military equipment it has on cyprus i declare that turkey does have to answer for its actions and further i maintain that they should answer to the people of the united states it is the united states after all as i said earlier that supplies and equips turkey with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of foreign aid each year and it is the united states that they are giving a slap in the face to when they knowingly and intentionally fail to comply with the restrictions we place on that assistance the unitedstates congress is on record with its sound conviction that there can be no resolution of the cyprus conflict unless and until the turkish troops are removed from the island rather than comply however turkey laughs in our faces and increases its military presence there and does so with no less than united states origin equipment even while both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee report out legislation prohibiting the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus congress position on the cyprus issue is clear both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee have reported out legislation that would prohibit the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus in the senate the foreign aid authorization bill contains the pell amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied military equipment from turkey to cyprus in the house the foreign aid bill contains language broomfieldyatronsnowe amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied arms from either turkey or greece to cyprus both bills also maintain the traditional 7 10 funding ratio between greece and turkey this legislation is anything but a radical approach to this critical problem instead it merely clarifies the intent of congress as expressed in the foreign assistance act i strongly support this legislation because i believe it would be repugnant to the rule of law that we talked about here earlier when the gentleman from california had his special order which is recognized in our constitution for the united states to support in a direct or indirect way this illegal occupation and division of cyprus i take this opportunity to ask my colleagues to likewise support this necessary legislation to make matters worse turkey has the unmitigated gall to inform the state department that it is reconsidering implementing the alreadyagreed to extension of our base rights agreement because of all things congress attitude on the cyprus issue heaven help us i think that the united states and we as legislators have been more than patient and have tolerated an intolerable situation more than long enough i believe that it is now time to implement action in order to force turkey to cease the actions that are preventing an appropriate resolution to the cypriot problem despite our security interests in a strong security interest in a strong relationship with turkey and god knows they are there and those of us who care about america are concerned with the fact that turkey is in a very strategic position as is the country of greece and as is the independent republic of cyprus we must no longer tolerate such intransigence by the leadership in ankara without strong united opposition by the united states to turkish efforts to ensure the permanent partition of cyprus we cannot expect peace to be achieved in that country in the near future cyprus has always been a good friend to the united states and we should do whatever we can to help bring about a just solution cyprus is after all not only strategically important to the peace of the region but it has proven itself time and again to be a good friend and ally of the united states it was for example cyprus not turkey that allowed the united states the use of its facilities to carry supplies to our dying marines in lebanonturkey refused it has furthermore offered us its unrestrictive assistance after the bombing of the marine barracks in beirut in 1983 the bombing of our embassy in beirut in 1984 and during the highjacking of twa flight 847 in 1985 and while we are at it it was the greeks who fought and died heroically in world war ii while turkey chose neutrality and though it is little known it was 38 greeks who joined 6 unitedstates marines to win a military victory in 1805 on the shores of tripoli the same victory i might add that is immortalized in the marine hymn from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli and i ask what has turkey contributed to the security of the west that is an open question turkey for example during the 1973 middle east war granted moscow overflight rights and overland passage rights to resupply syria and egypt while refusing united states overflights rights to resupply israel and among other questionable acts allowed soviet aircraft carriers passage through the dardanelles in violation of the montreux convention of 1936 and over nato objections we as legislators and we as americans must therefore do all in our power to bring about a just and lasting solution to the cypriot issue we must condition aid to turkey on her genuine efforts to reach just such a solution and we must push to see that this solution meets certain minimum conditions of acceptability including first the immediate withdrawal of all turkish occupation forces and colonists from cyprus second the immediate return of all occupied areas to the republic of cyprus under u n auspices for the immediate resettlement of the 200 000 greek cypriot refugees third an agreement by turkey and the turkishcypriots to a constitutional arrangement based on the universally accepted democratic principle of majority rule with full minority rights guaranteed as well as freedom of movement settlement and ownership anywhere in cyprus after all should there be a green line there i think not fourth an agreement by turkey to full cooperation with the international red cross regarding investigation of the five abducted americans and the 1 614 missing greek cypriots i might add that this factor in the cypriot issue has unfortunately not received as much international attention and concern as it might have and rightfully deserves the fact is that much like the americans missing in vietnam 1 619 individuals including 5 americans have been missing since the turkish invasion of cyprus clearly any fair and appropriate resolution of the issue must fully and adequately address the fate of these unfortunate victims and their families and so in closing i say on behalf of all three nations over there on behalf of american security and american interests in that entire area let us all work in earnest to return peace and unity to the republic of cyprus the cards are after all largely in our hands let us deal a fair and appropriate hand"]], "top_unsure": [[5.3942203521728516e-05,
