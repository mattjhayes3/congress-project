leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"], [4.4465065002441406e-05, 0.9999555349349976, 1, "i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this special order and for your continued leadership on so many vital issues and for staying the course and holding down the fort for the congressional black caucus it is so important that our message of unity and our messagewhich really describes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are faced withthat that message goes out both of you have really been tremendous in this effort so i rise this evening to join this critical conversation on race relations in america and to challenge our colleagues to work with the congressional black caucus to realize progress for racial justice and equality i join congresswoman kelly and congressman payne in sending my condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in paris lebanon nigeria and also in egypt know that we join in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonights special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to african americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it is manifested in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman payne said so eloquently we are the united states so when one is affected all are affected all across the country at universities like mizzou and yale in places like baltimore and ferguson and in high schools like spring valley high in columbia south carolina we are witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at berkley high school in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but i am so proud of the students at berkley they walked offit was not only black students it was all studentsand marched out peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete this crisis isnt limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee and the congressional black caucus more than one in three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions mind you now that is preschool that is students from about 2 years old to 4 years old black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment i cant figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is expelled from school that is outrageous yet 42 percent of preschool student expulsions are african american babies these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start outside of the classroom african americans are overpoliced overcriminalized and underemployed a report published by the new york times in april found that there are an estimated 1 5 million black men between the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life just missing it these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession this must be our call to action that is why i am so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it is time for congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter and black students matter earlier this month i held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second forum that i have held throughout the last 3 months now i have been able to reach over 1 000 east bay residents so tonight in this dialogue which congressman payne and congresswoman kelly have talked about this dialogue leads to action hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forums and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it is past time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there is legislation that can start moving the needle forward we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step toward returning some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman sensenbrenner and congressman scott congress should also pass the stop militarizing law enforcement act h r 1232 to stop the militarization of our nations police forces we also should pass the police accountability act h r 1102 and the grand jury reform act h r 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that there is more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening america we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldnt continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and should ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the ineligibility for public assistance and food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african american men and latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we have the whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which i am proud to chair with our whip mr hoyer we are working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to advance policies that give all families including african american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities a fair shot this effort includes our half in ten act h r 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that is more than 22 million americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act h r 2721 would create goodpaying jobs it would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give african americans and people of color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers my mentor the honorable congresswoman shirley chisholm used to say if they dont give you a seat at the table bring in a folding chair that is what our young people are doing around the country so i want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep fighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all which means just that it means for all in doing so we will make the united states a stronger country i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this very important special order i know that out of this discussion we are laying out what can be done and it doesnt take another generation to end racial injustice in our country"], [4.4465065002441406e-05, 0.9999555349349976, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume the rule here today provides for consideration of three bills all of which i oppose in their current form i want to talk about each of those we also have under this rule a closed process this resolution contains the 19th and 20th closed rules of this congress instead of having an open debate about taxes here on tax day we see nothing more than recycled partisan measures and attacks on consumer protections that are disguised and under the guise of a small business advisory board which had historically been a bipartisan effort while discussing tax legislation on tax day may not seem the most exciting piece of legislative news to our constituents i hope they are watching today this rule and this bill we are bringing under it really demonstrate the gulf that exists between our two parties when we talk about things like middle class economics this is a 296 billion tax cut so if we have 296 billion in taxes cut who are we going to cut taxes for this bill affects 100 families in colorado with the same amount of money 296 billion we could cut taxes for every american adult by 1 000 that 1 000 would mean a lot to middle class families it might help pay for your kids college tuition it might help pay for a family vacation but instead of directing money there we are directing it to the very wealthiest americans namely those who die with more than a 10 million estate for a married couple i think we see a stark contrast on priorities while i disagree with the policies and tactics that are under consideration i think it is important to talk about what a democratic majority would do here on tax day we would certainly not be about to consider a bill that applies to literally zero percent of taxpayers let me clarify because that may seem strange to some people that this applies to zero percent of taxpayers but the bill we are considering with regard to the inheritance tax on estates over 10 million would apply to 0 15 percent of taxpayers that can be rounded down to zero it doesnt even apply to those taxpayers it applies to them after they are dead so it applies to zero living americans mind you we wont have a debate about the broken immigration policies that impact over 11 million immigrant workers who would grow the tax base we wont have discussions on reducing taxes for the middle class but we are having policies that affect a few thousand dead people a few thousand rich dead people i might add if there were a democratic majority on tax day we would be working to provide tax relief to middle class families rather than offering a bill that would gut one agency whose sole purpose is to protect middle class consumers and delivering a tax break to rich dead families we have another bill under this rule ostensibly about a small business advisory board this is a worthwhile effort to provide a small business advisory input to the consumer financial protection bureau unfortunately it is a minimal cost 9 million but the republicans are offering a way of paying for it that guts the consumer financial protection bureau they are effectively cutting off your arm to remove a splinter in your pinky well look if the majority was consistent when they say the deficit matters and we must pay for legislationbut we are dealt with two bills that are mutually exclusive on the one hand they are handing out 269 billion in deficit spending through providing tax cuts to 1 000 americans who are already dead and on the other hand they are saying this 9 million dollars somehow we have to figure out a way of paying for and they are effectively gutting the financial protection agency to do it that is because this 9 million is apparently a step too far even though they are offering two bills one that adds 269 billion to the deficit and the other adds 42 billion to the deficit which i will talk about in a minute in this year alone the house ways and means committee has given congress nine tax expenditure bills at a cost of 317 billion all unfunded 317 billion in tax expenditure spending not even including this 269 billion that they are looking at doing today and what bothers me most about this rule today is where we say to ourselves look we will spend 269 billion for a tax expenditure for dead rich people 42 billion on a tax reform that will ultimately make tax reform harder but we cant spend 9 million on a bill to help small business i am sure that we all have a lot of ideas on both sides of the aisle about how we can spend money if we have 269 billion in tax expenditures to use why dont we direct that to a tax cut for small businesses or to reducing the corporate tax rate which is one of the highest in the world or reducing the middle class tax rate but instead it is being directed entirely to approximately 100 dead people in colorado rather than allowing businesses to keep more of their money so they can reinvest in their infrastructure and create jobs this precious tax break we are giving to 100 dead people in the state of colorado we should be talking about tax reform today we should be talking about how to reduce taxes for the middle class instead we are having a closed debate about another set of bills that will likely not pass the senate and if they got to the presidents desk he would veto i urge my colleagues to reject this rule the repeal of the estate tax is very hard to explain to our constituents that is because it is 269 billion that benefits almost no oneless than 100 people in the state of colorado now when my friends call this the death tax or somehow say this will help small business lets keep in mind you dont even pay inheritance tax on the first 5 million of your estate 10 million for a married couple so you can die with a 5 million small business a 10 million small business for a couple and your heirs pay zero tax on thatzero tax what we are saying now is that the very limited number of families that might have estates of 50 million or 60 million instead of paying tax on that should pay zero tax on that and just have the costs of that added to the deficit there are a lot of ideas about spending 269 billion we could say oh we could spend it on schools or science and research or even if we limit ourselves to what we want to do with taxes why arent we lowering taxes on business why arent we talking about reducing the marginal rate why arent we talking about reducing all the tax brackets across the board why arent we talking about a tax refund to middle class families instead we are spending 269 billion on a few hundred dead rich people from a tax policy standpoint that has got to be one of the least productive ways to attempt to cut taxes you want to cut taxes on small businesses no argument here give it to them while they are living i was a smallbusinessman before i got here i would have loved to have been able to keep more of my own money to be able to invest in the growth of my small business rather than receive a tax break when i am already dead this makes no sense in the world look we would all love to get rid of every tax wouldnt weestate tax business tax income taxbut we all agree that government needs so much money to function we have a house budget the house budget that this body agreed to stipulates a certain amount of tax breaks it is up to our body to decide how to deliver those tax breaks i honestly think that almost every businessowner would rather see lower rates while they are alive so they could grow their companies faster creating growth and employing people rather than a tax break after they are dead proponents of this bill tell stories about how many businesses or farms are harmed every year by the estate tax well how many of those same farms and businesses are harmed by the hardearned money that they are forced to turn over to the government every year why arent we saying give less of your hardearned income to the government every year but no the republican taxandspend approach continues to oppress small businesses with higher and higher taxes oppress the middle class with higher and higher taxes while they are only concerned with delivering a tax break to dead rich people i simply disagree that this is an efficient way to use our tax code to spur economic growth chairman ryan knows full well that i am enthusiastic about having a discussion about our tax code how to cut taxes for business reduce the burden on small businesses simplify and streamline the tax code by reducing tax expenditures and bringing down tax rates to ensure that the capital expenditures by businesses and reinvesting in businesses are determined by businessowners rather than by lobbyists here in washington these bills are a step in the wrong direction away from tax reform and are detrimental to the american middle class and to american small businesses i reserve the balance of my time"], [4.458427429199219e-05, 0.999955415725708, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman kelly for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [4.494190216064453e-05, 0.9999550580978394, 1, "i come to the floor today to mark world aids day i do so in great pride following my colleague from ohio congresswoman joyce beatty who spoke on the floor about the 60th anniversary of what happened in montgomery when rosa parks with great courage refused to give up her seat on the bus the courage of that woman and all of those who supported her has made such an incredible difference in our country and it is indeed related to what i want to say about hiv and aids many of us had the privilege of knowing rosa parks when she worked for john conyers we honored her here in the house and are so proud that we have a statue of rosa parks in the capitol of the united states we think of her and we think of the courage she had which led to the civil rights act the voting rights act and that voting rights act and civil rights act led to our having a much more diverse congress of the united states from there came our congressional black caucus the hispanic caucus and the asian pacific caucus the black caucus directly related to mr conyers who was a founding member and rosa parks who was an inspiration they were responsible for so much change in the leadership of our congress and because so many issues spring from the congressional black caucus some say the conscience of the congress so the relationship from rosa parks through the caucus to now we are observing the 25th anniversary of world aids day the link is congresswoman barbara lee who has been such a champion in the congress on this subject we take great pride in the accomplishments she has had in her capacity as a member of congress but also as our representative to the united nations general assembly each year world aids day is observed internationally to reflect the progress that has been made in reaffirming our determination to banish aids to the annals of history we recognize that achieving an aidsfree generation requires our relentless energetic and undaunted commitment to testing treatment and finding a cure the world aids day theme this year the time to act is now challenges us to act with the urgency that this global epidemic demands aids as we know and the hiv virus is a ferocious and resourceful disease a resourceful virus evermutating to escape our efforts to destroy it therefore we have to be ferocious resourceful and adaptable in our effort to succeed to end hiv we must bring bold thinking and deep commitment to testing treatment and the search for a cure and a vaccine to prevent president bush with his pepfar initiative took a big advance in how we can help prevent the spread of aids in the rest of the world he and mrs bush with their pink ribbon red ribbon initiative to link cervical cancer prevention with hiv testing and treatment in africa was a remarkable initiative so we salute the bipartisanship we supported of course president bush with pepfar we wanted it bigger and he wanted it strong and there we were with something that has saved millions of lives and given hope to people i visited some of the clinics in africa where pepfar is being administered and some of the people i met there said i would never have come in to be tested before because there was no reason i had no hope that there would be any remedy or any maintaining of a quality of life that would have encouraged me to risk the stigma of saying that i was hivinfected so again it is all about the people in new york today bono will be observing the 10th anniversary of the one and red initiatives that have set out to alleviate poverty and eradicate disease with a heavy focus on hiv aids we know the work of the melinda and bill gates foundation and what they have done on this issue particularly in india i today also wish i could be in san francisco where amfar will be saluting the work at university of californiasan francisco on hiv aids by establishing a new initiative there i am just mentioning a few other observances of world aids day it is happening throughout the world if you go back a number of years when i came to congress we were going to two funerals a day it was the saddest thing now we are going to weddings and helping people make out their wills and all the rest because they have a longer life ahead the maintenance of life the quality of life is really important but we do want a cure so i said it was the 25th anniversary of world aids day i meant to say the 25th anniversary of the ryan white care act that young man whose name is something that is iconic to all of us left us but his mother carries on the tradition and it has made such a tremendous difference my colleague henry waxman who is no longer in the congress but is still a champion on hiv aids was so instrumental in leading us to passing that legislation so it has been bipartisan it is global it is personal it is urgent that we continue so that one day 50 years from now people will say what was aids what was that and the books will show that it was a terrible terrible tragedy that befell the worlds population regardless of status of wealth of gender or of race and something that is now buried in the news somewhere as a terrible memory but not a part of our future again as we observe world aids day may we all wear our red ribbons in sympathy with those who have lost their lives sadly before the science took us to a better place on this that is what we are counting on research and science to take us to a better place on this and also the enthusiasm determination and relentlessness of so many people throughout the world to make hiv aids a horrible horrible memory again but not part of our future"], [4.5299530029296875e-05, 0.9999547004699707, 1, "we should not be here today we should not have to come to the floor of the house of representatives to beg the majority party just to debate and vote on commonsense gun legislation that the vast majority of americans demand we should not be living in a society where debate and even scientific research about gun violence are stifled and silenced by the majority in congress and we should not live in a country where gun violence takes such a toll on our citizens but here we are standing up for the millions of americans who want congress to do something and honoring the thousands of americans who have lost their lives to gun violence here we are standing up for our constituents who are tired of the excuses and want to hear a debate and want to see us take action on gun violence and here we are today to represent the victims the list is so long orlando san bernardino newton fort hood charleston the list goes on nine in a church 23 in a restaurant 26 in an elementary school and now 49 in a nightclub the victims are men and women black and white rich and poor old and young at a mcdonalds in california an 8monthold baby was killed along with his mother who was trying to shelter him when a gunman came in and started shooting at a north carolina nursing home a 98yearold grandmother was killed when a shooter came in and opened fire here in the united states you are 10 times more likely to be killed by a gun than in any other developed nation in the world of the 23 richest and most developed countries in the world we have by far the most gun violence we have half the population of the other 22 but 90 percent of the women killed by a gun are killed by a gun in the united states ninetyone percent of the children under age 14 who are killed by a gun are killed by a gun in the united states and if you are a young person in this country you are 50 times more likely to die of a gun death than in all of those other countries we have the most guns and we have the most gun violence we have the nra through fear intimidation and misinformation the nra has taken control over the debate on guns to such an extent that we cannot even vote in this chamber on whether we should keep guns out of the hands of terrorists right now someone can be on both the terrorist watch list and the nofly list in other words the fbi thinks you are a terrorist and the tsa bans you from flying but if you want to drive down to your local gun store and buy an assault rifle there is nothing anyone can do to stop you over the last 10 years people on the terrorist watch list tried to buy explosives or firearms 2 233 times over 90 percent of the time they were successful this is wrong the american people know it is wrong public health officials know it is wrong and nearly every single law enforcement association in america knows it is wrong which is why they are all in favor of closing the terrorist gun loophole in fact a recent poll by a republican pollster found 76 percent of gun owners and 71 percent of nra members said suspected terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns if you were to walk outside the house of representatives right now and stop someone walking down the street and ask the simple question should terrorists be allowed to buy guns you would get a very simple answer they would say no of course terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns but they can republicans here in the house wont even let us have a debate and a vote on it how did we get here mr speaker how has the debate shifted so far away from commonsense gun regulation that a proposal to close the terrorist gun loophole is this controversial why is it that here in the house debate is silenced and we are not allowed to vote the closest we came to a debate on gun legislation recently came last week when a controversy erupted about the standard procedure to observe a moment of silence on the house floor after a mass shooting it is shameful that we have allowed this country to get to a point where congress has to even have a standard procedure to observe mass shootings yet we arent even allowed to have a debate about legislation to address this problem it is time for us to stand up to the nra to have a fair and open debate about gun violence and it is time for all of us to do our job representing the american people"], [4.601478576660156e-05, 0.9999539852142334, 1, "i

with the pain that we have seen not only in baltimore which we have seen most recently but in cities like ferguson in north charleston in new york where we have seen the convergence of poverty and the need for criminal justice reform converge i too want to offer my sympathy to the family of freddie gray we have watched them over the past couple of days in the midst of their mourning to be able to stand up and call for peace nonviolence nonviolent protests they should be honored and to those in baltimore and particularly my colleague from marylandi will call him congressman cummings with the bullhorn politics the bullhorn leadershiphe should be commended for the stunning and outstanding engagement that he touched the hearts and minds of his constituents walked those streets to be able to acknowledge the pain the poverty but that there is a better way that there is a way toward the stars that we all want our children to have and yes to ms graham who wanted better for her son michael i want him not to be embarrassed but to be proud that he had a mother with such deep love that she wanted to take him away from doing it wronglynot against protests not against the quiet marching of the spirit of dr king but to know that engaging in violence is intolerable and will not allow him to reach the very high heights that he can reach today i stand here to acknowledge the convergence of the need for criminal justice reform and the deep and abiding poverty in the african american community one in every six americans is living in poverty totaling 46 2 million people this is the highest number in 17 years children represent a disproportionate amount of the united states poor population it falls heavily on the african american community in my district there are 190 000plus living in poverty it falls heavily on the african american community this is not a standing invitation for the door to open and say lets blame president obama president obama has been a stellar leader on the questions of realizing the investment in people from the stimulus that brought us out of the depths of collapse of the markets and a complete imploding of the capitalistic system he provided the stimulus that moved us toward an economy where we were creating jobs but here we have in congress this dastardly sequester that is cutting head start seats not investing in infrastructure not creating jobs or providing opportunities for our young people so today i say that there needs to be a call for action that call for action is that this congress must get rid of sequester and must look at the baltimores and must look at the fergusons and houstons and l a s and new yorks and cities across america and realize that we are coming upon a summertime and if we dont act to invest in our children and to begin to give an agenda to release ourselves from poverty we will have doomed ourselves and i would offer to say that the inertia of moving toward criminal justice reform in this congress is unacceptable i call upon members to come together collectively to be able to pass legislation the cadet bill that i have introduced the build trust bill but more importantly i am calling upon our government to invest in our youth to get rid of the poverty to prepare them as they go into higher education as they go into upper grades we must have a program of summer jobs this summer and we must have a collaborative effort with corporate america wake up corporate america wake up corporate baltimore wake up corporate new york wake up corporate houston there must be an investment in summer jobs collaborating with the federal government to make a difference to lift families out of poverty we do know that summer jobs with young people elevate families ability to pay their bills and to provide resources for their families so if the story of baltimore is any it is one dont jump to conclusions dont jump to conclusions that freddie gray tried to hurt himself dont jump to conclusions that these young people dont mean well dont jump to conclusions that they shouldnt have done what they have done jump to the conclusions that these are young people who are hungry and looking for leadership and are in pain as congressman cummings said look for the opportunity for them help rebuild baltimore help give them jobs help tell them that the improved relationships between police and community are going to be moved forward as a number one agenda for the united states congress and this government that they call the united states of america let us have a call to actionnot of condemnation but of action i want to thank the young people who nonviolently marched all over america indicating black lives matter and all lives matter the congressional black caucus stands to stamp out poverty and we

stark reminder of the urgent responsibility that we have to reduce gun violence in this country this monstrous attack on the lgbt community in a place of refuge and empowerment requires us to act the shooter in orlando used an assault rifle that is virtually identical to the ones used by mass killers in san bernardino umpqua community college aurora and sandy hook elementary school that is no coincidence out of the eight highprofile mass shootings that have taken place in the past year seven involved the use of an assault weapon when an assault weapon is used in a mass shooting the number of people shot increases by 153 percent and the number of people killed increases by 63 percent these are weapons of war that are designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible they belong on a battlefield they dont belong in our communities and i will continue to fight to reinstate the assault weapons ban this morning i want to use the time that i have to talk about two proposals that the speaker should bring up for immediate vote no fly no buy and universal background checks this is really really simple if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane then you are too dangerous to buy a gun but under the laws that we have in place today someone who is on the fbis terrorist watch list who is too dangerous to get on a plane can still walk into any gun store in america pass a background check and walk out with an assault weapon or any other gun he wants in fact from 2004 until 2014 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists bought firearms legally in this country and they are going to continue doing so until we stop them until 9 11 bombs were the weapon of choice for terrorists looking to strike the united states but in the 15 years since then 95 percent of terrorist deaths that took place in the united states resulted from gunfire it is impossibleimpossibleto understand that house republicans have now voted 13 times to block the no fly no buy proposal that congressman peter king and congressman mike thompson introduced to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists in this country why what are they afraid of that we might actually stop a terrorist from passing a background check before he buys an assault rifle at cabelas bring the no fly no buy bill to the floor today lets have an upordown vote let the american people hold us accountable for where we stand this should be a nobrainer more than 80 percent of americans believe we should prevent suspected terrorists from buying a gun and more than 90 percent of americans believe that a background check should be required on every firearm sale so we can keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with such serious mental illness that possessing a gun would make them a danger to themselves or others bills are pending to fix our background check system and to require a background check on every gun sale this is one of the single most important and effective steps that we can take to reduce gun violence in this country right now anyone can go to a gun show or get on the internet and purchase a gun without a background check as many as two out of every five firearm transactions today are conducted without a background check it is too easy for a criminal a domestic abuser a terrorist or someone with a serious mental illness to buy a gun through this loophole every day background checks block 171 attempted purchases by felons 48 attempted purchases by domestic abusers and 19 attempted purchases by fugitives it is critical that we strengthen the background check system and require checks on all firearm sales so we can keep more dangerous individuals from acquiring these deadly weapons bring the fix gun checks act to the floor today we held a moment of silence last week for the victims in orlando i know that all of us have kept the victims and their loved ones and the people of orlando in our thoughts and prayers since june 12 but the best way to honor the lives lost in this horrific tragedy is to do something to prevent it from happening to others a moment of silence is not enough we need a moment of sustained action in this chamber and we need it today it will be an insult to the victims of this shooting and their families and every victim of every shooting in this country if we continue to do nothing to prevent future tragedies do not let this chamber adjourn until we have voted on these critical issues bring these bills to the floor today nothing is more important than stopping the bloodshed and ensuring the safety and security of

to our nations children i have to say to mr takano that i am not happy at all and i dont think many of us are happy at what is taking place with regard to this improving child nutrition education act and what is happening to our children who many go to bed hungry at night so i thank the gentleman very much for his leadership let me just say to mr scott who is our ranking member it is very important that we recognize the gentlemans leadership and know that he is on this committee fighting each and every day to make sure that this reauthorization bill which would take food out of mouths of american schoolchildren does not do that so i thank the gentleman for his fight on the committee let me say just a couple of things with regard to h r 5003 it would turn the clock back on years of progress and prevent children from eating healthy meals every day this republican child nutrition bill would roll back critical evidencebased nutrition standards made in the 2010 reauthorization bill which we were very actively involved with sadly but unsurprisingly it would also deny eligible children access to the free or reduced price school meals program and it would slash funding for some electronics benefits transfer 1915 i just have to say that as a young single mother on public assistance and food stamps i dont know what i would have done had my children not had school lunches this was a bridge over troubled waters for me and my children and i have to thank my government for that helping hand but today in 2016 this bill will roll back these programs which means more hungry kids in our schools and in our neighborhoods that is why several of us are sending a letter to the education and the workforce committee outlining our deep concerns with the changes to our child nutrition programs i hope that everyone on our side of the aisle signs this important letter and i hope that the majority will read it carefully it lays out some of the basic problems in this bill we want to make sure that everyone on the committee and this entire body understands the impact of what this will cause when we take away access to these meals we jeopardize childrens health their educational attainment and really their future we know that children who have access to healthy meals are more likely to do well in school have decreased behavioral problems and come to class ready to learn that is what we should want for all of our children for the children growing up in highpoverty neighborhoods and who lack equal access to healthy meals these school meals really are a lifeline we are not just talking about a few students the numbers are clear more than 15 3 million children are living in foodinsecure households let me say that again more than 15 million kids are at risk of going to bed hungry every night in america the richest and most powerful country in the world we also know that childhood hunger is far from colorblind children of color are disproportionately affected by hunger every day for example in 2014 one in three african american children and one in four latino children were food insecure for children who live in rural communities food insecurity is coupled with other barriers like lack of access to transportation to get to summer feeding sites more than 17 percent of rural householdsthat is 3 3 million householdsare food insecure child hunger and the lack of nutritious food is a problem that affects every child in every zip code it is endemic in our country in rural urban and suburban schools every member of congress has constituents who are hungry this should be a priority for all of us i have seen the impact of food insecurity in my own community in oakland california where one in four children at the oakland unified school district do not have access to affordable nutritious food these families are forced to make impossible choices to feed their children especially during the summer months when schools are closed these families are making decisions every day between food and medicine food and rent or food and paying the electric bill we need real solutions to these very real problems let me just mention my legislation the half in ten act h r 258 that would develop a national strategy to cut poverty in half over the next decade that is more than 23 million americans lifted out of poverty and into the middle class in just the next 10 years this bill that we are talking about tonight goes just the opposite way surely we can all recognize that ensuring healthy meals for american children is the first step in this ongoing war on poverty it should not be a partisan issue feeding hungry kids is a moral imperative so lets put our children first and lets strengthen our child nutrition programs rather than cut them our children deserve the security of knowing where their next meal is coming from that is just basic it is a basic american value i thank congressman scott for his leadership and thank him for yielding"],

have sharp differences but have expressed them in a civil fashion i also want to agree with him with respect to the great job the budget committee staff has done both democrat and republican and agree with him on one more thingand it may be the last thing i agree with the gentleman on during this debate dr elmendorf the current head of the congressional budget office has done a great job and we are going to have a little bit more to say about that later we all believe in america mr chair but i do not believe this republican budget reflects the values and priorities it is the wrong direction for america now as we gather here today we are facing some good news we are facing some bad news and we are facing some really bad news the good news is the economy is improving more people are going back to work in fact the private sector has added 12 million new jobs over the last 60 months it is not all rosy many americans are still looking for work but the unemployment rate has fallen to 5 5 percent and trends are good the bad news is that americans are working harder than ever but their paychecks are flat this is not a new problem it is not even a problem in the last 2 years or just the last 5 years it goes back quite a ways in fact as this chart indicates we have seen a growing gap between worker productivity which has been rising steadily and the incomes and paychecks of most working americans if you look at this chart it is very interesting because it goes from 1948 to the 1970s and you see these two lines are convergent that means the additional worker productivitythe hard work of american workerswas translated into higher paychecks and compensation for them but starting around the 1970s you saw the great divergence worker productivity went up people are working harder than ever better than ever but their paychecks and compensation have been pretty much flat so where is the value of that hard work going if people are working harder than ever why arent their paychecks keeping track well that additional value of hard work is no longer going to regular working americanspeople working for a paycheck it has gone overwhelmingly to folks at the top and i dont mean just the top 10 it has gone overwhelmingly to the top 1 percent of americans who have seen their incomes rise dramatically even as everybody else has pretty much been running in place and flat so our challenge to all those people working really hardharder than everis how can we make sure that they benefit from that increased productivity we had some hope right after the november election i remember opening up the newspaperthe wall street journal there was an oped piece by speaker boehner and republican senate leader mitch mcconnell and here is what they said they said that they were humbled by the opportunity to help struggling middle class americans and to deal with wage stagnation that is what they said right after the election but the very bad news today for the country is if you look at this republican budget it turns out they were just kidding this republican budget is really hard on hardworking americans and those who are looking hard to find a job it says keep working harder but you are going to get less it will do nothing to increase paychecks and takehome pay for working families in fact it squeezes them even harder and tighter it will increase the tax burden on millions of familiesthose in the middle class and those working hard to join the middle class amazingly it just drops the higher education tax credits it ends the boost in the child tax credit millions of americans will lose access to affordable care tax credits it is not just working families students who are working hard to try and get a job are going to find college even less affordable than today this republican budget cuts student loans it increases the cost of student loans it starts charging students interest while they are still in college it cuts 90 billion from pellmandatoryand more it is not just students and working families seniors who have worked hard to secure a healthy retirement are going to see their costs go up immediately prescription drugs will cost more copayments for preventive health services go up right away nursing home care will get much more expensive as they cut 90 billion out of medicaid twothirds of which goes to help seniors and disabled individuals most of the rest goes to families with kids and then they turn medicare into a voucher program that will reduce medicare benefits so while this republican budget squeezes hardworking families increases the cost of college for students squeezes seniorshigher costs for themit is great for those who are already in the top 1 percent it is great for millionaires in fact this budget paves the way for the romneyryan plan to cut the tax rate for millionaires by a third it paves the way it green lights it if you look at this budget it is based on a failed and unproven economic theorytopdown trickledown economicsthe same old theory the theory that collided with the real world under president bush in the 2000s right it cut the top tax rate the theory was that benefits would trickle down and lift everybody up guess what incomes to the top 1 percent went up everybody else ran aground yachts went up everyone elses boat ran aground that is what happened guess what else went up deficits went up but everybody else was running in place or fell behind and here is the thing while this republican budget makes life harder right away for hardworking americanslife will get harder immediatelyit also disinvests in our future it slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our kids educationfrom early education and head start to k12 and beyond it is a sad day when we start chopping away at the ladder of opportunity in this country it will also devastate the investments our country has historically made in scientific research and innovation investments that have helped power our economy and keep us at the cutting edge of world technology and guess what else it provides no solution no answer to the fact that in just a few months in may we are going to face a shortfall in the transportation trust fund that will result in a construction slowdown this summer it does nothing about that in the budget it says oh were going to come up with something after todayin a couple months so mr chair when i say that this budget disinvests in america it is not rhetoric it is a mathematical reality i want people to look at this chart this is a chart of the share of our economy that we spend on the investment portion of our budgetthe investment in our kids education the investment in scientific research like the medical research to help find treatments and cures to diseases like cancer or diabetes or other diseases that plague american families here is what the republican budget does it takes that investment budget and throws it off the cliff to the point that it is 40 percent below the lowest level as a share of the economy since we have been keeping records in the late 1950s here is a country that invested in the gi bill we invested in our infrastructure and the national highway system we have invested in our kids education this republican budget disinvests in america so it cuts all those things i will tell you one thing it doesnt cut it doesnt cut one single tax break for the purpose of reducing the deficit not one penny not one penny to reduce the deficit we hear that the highest priority is to reduce the deficit but yes lets cut our investment in education yeah lets cut our investment in innovation lets not fund the transportation trust fundbut we are not going to cut one single tax break for the purpose of reducing the deficit not for corporate jets not for hedge fund owners not one despite all that and despite the deep cuts it makes in our investment the reality is this budget doesnt balance it doesnt balance not by a long shot this budget takes budget quackery to new heights it claims to repeal the affordable care act but it uses the revenues and the savings from the affordable care act to claim balance at the end of 10 years senator enzi the new republican chairman of the senate budget committee said that was kind of a budget accounting that he didnt think was right the heritage foundation they called that question as well in comments last time this came up here is the other thing the budget doesnt account for the almost 1 trillion in tax extenders that our republican colleagues brought to the floor last fall and are on the way to bringing to the floor now 1 trillion if you add that to the deficit which is real money it is even farther out of balance then they go and claim a deficit dividend based on phantom deficit reductions here is the number this is in the 10th year this is in the 10th year when they say their budget is really in balance by 33 billion well it is not if you take out the affordable care act revenue if you take out the affordable care act savings if you add in the tax extenders costs that our republican colleagues keep bringing to the floor you dont come close to balance not close this balanced budget stuff it just isnt true it is just not true it would make enron accountants blush i think most americans would agree that this budgetcutting tax rates for the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on working families raising the cost to seniors raising the cost to students cutting vital investmentswill simply stack the deck even more in favor of the very wealthy and the very powerful and make it harder on everyone else to get ahead we can do better we can do much better and democrats will propose a budget that promotes a more rapidly

believe in encouraging employee ownership through esops options this bill does part we can do a lot more it is a big thing that we can do to address the increasing income disparities that this country has in making sure that workers can participate in capital formation and capital growth along with owners and executives we look forward to working with the gentleman on that bill and contacting the gentleman as well the gentleman from ohio said that somehow legal operating businesses must have access to banking resources the goal of this bill he said oh wait a minute i mean federal ones not state ones not federal not state this is where you have a difference of course you wont have any disagreement that there is an ambiguity here with regard to types of businesses that are legal at the state level and are not legal federally but this is where you will find that most democrats believe very strongly in states rights most republicans believe here with the exception of the other gentleman from california who just spoke and a number of others who would allow a majority to support this bill but apparently the gentleman from ohio believes in an overarching federal definition telling states what they can and cant do indirectly through the banking system effectively constraining their ability to allow banks to serve businesses that might sell types of firearms that are illegal federally or types of marijuana or hemp or other products that might be illegal federally effectively they are arguing that the federal government should tell them what to do and impose a onesizefitsall solution on states that are as diverse as texas and california and colorado and north dakota i disagree with that premise as do most of the democrats here today we feel that while this body of courseand i agree with the gentlemanshould continue with the discussion about the regulatory structure of legal treatment of cannabis products federally that should in no way shape or form stand in the way of a simple fix that says whether you want it to be legal or illegal transactions should be traceable safe through the banking system for businesses that are legal at the state level let me address h r 1675 the encouraging employee ownership act also being named the capital markets improvement act it is a good piece of bipartisan legislation that i think can be made even better through the amendment process title i of this bill which will revise the secs rule 701 by raising and indexing for inflation the threshold under which companies can issue stock to employees without running into government red tape is a commonsense good piece of legislation i hope it is something that most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with i am an early cosponsor of this legislation and i think we should promote and applaud the structure the indexation and of course allowing employees to have a stake in their companies that is not the only solution the gentleman from california might have some other ideas i look forward to discussing as do i but if you want to help solve some of our nations issues with income inequality and the wealth gap then we should applaud and promote companies that incorporate employee stock or option ownership whether you issue stock in the manner under this bill or whether you operate in esop or any of the other forms that allow workers to benefit from the growth of your company we should find ways to work together to promote and encourage this style of corporate governance title ii is a safe harbor for investment research a bill that will help improve available market information for investors and something that has broad bipartisan support i know my colleague from delaware will also be pleased to see this pass as an original sponsor my colleague from ohio who is a cochair with me of the congressional caucus for middle market growth spoke yesterday and today about how this overall package of legislation will help grow companies in the allimportant middle market this is main street america these are companies that might not be big enough to be multinational multibilliondollar brand names and they are not startups or small companies but it is the engine of our economy the portion of the market that is a vital piece of our economic engine creating jobs on main street title iii of this bill will work to reduce red tape for these very middle market companies these provisions have broad bipartisan support and i applaud them the sec has largely agreed with this in fact the only argument against it has been we already do this and i think that is a weak argument because we ought to put it in statute the sec has agreed and has taken action but unfortunately some of their actions have added in some increased investor impediments as well i hope the administration can work with congress to improve this bill if there are specific issues they have with it but the bill is necessary it is better to fix things in statute i think that we can work together to reduce red tape to grow small and middlesized companies title v of the bill is another bipartisan piece of legislation that is in line with the sort of regulatory review that we already ask in many agencies it is the sort of good government legislation i think both sides of the aisle can find agreement on and hopefully support now title iv of h r 1675 unfortunately is a bit of a step in the wrong direction and it is something we discussed extensively in the committee yesterday fortunately for this provision there was an open process mr issa and mr ellison have amendments that will be considered that improve the portion of the bill or remove it entirely unfortunately the bill as written is a move away from searchable financial reporting that can be done digitally it is a step away from sortable and downloadable formats it is a return to the pen and paper and inefficient world of the 20th century rather than a step forward to the open data transparency world of the 21st century across the board market participants investors and regulators want information that is already requiredwe are not talking about any new requirementsinformation that is already required financial information to simply be available in a digital searchable format that is all we seek to preserve and not eliminate it is an odd and outdated use of government resources to deal with this information by hand by pen by paper it puts investors and others at an enormous disadvantage and it prevents and reduces the amount of information in the marketplace searchable and sortable data can be better used to track trends find anomalies find investment opportunities and help regulators notice trouble spots in markets and hopefully catch the next enron before it explodes just as importantly investors need information so do entrepreneurial folks who want to take this information and package it in new and interesting and exciting ways and sell it on to institutional and individual investors we heard yesterday from detractors who said investors arent asking for this information we also heard that the committee didnt include any investors in their testimony they only included operating companies i am not sure who they are speaking for but in my conversations i have never heard any investor say i want less information or i want information to be harder to search or find no investor says i want to know less about a companys earnings i want it to be in an archaic pen and paper format that argument that this information isnt welcome by investors is simply incorrect and it is counter to anything you will ever hear from anyone in the investment community hopefully we will fix these issues through amendment overall i believe this package should merit serious consideration and support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle h r 766 the financial institution customer protection act does address a very important issue and that is the inexcusable actions of operation choke point which at best could be described as an overzealous use of the department of justices power or at worst as a pernicious attempt to root out activities that are determined to be politically unpopular unfortunately as we examine this bill it looks like it has some unintended consequences which are not addressed through the amendment process the amendment process also fails to include a simple amendment that would further the goals of this bill with regard to the regulated marijuana industry in 22 states i hope that we can address the operation choke point issue i hope we can prevent this administration and future administrations from engaging having doj engage in this kind of troublesome use of authority to coerce closures of accounts for otherwise legitimate and legal customers of local financial institutions if a bank or credit union has a legal business it is legal in the state they deem it creditworthy they are a good customer and they want to open an account with them they should be able to serve that customer the federal government should not use the bank itself as an intermediary in a dispute if the doj has a dispute with a banks customer that should be resolved between the doj and the customer not the bank i hope that there is groundwork for bipartisan legislation in this area that can ensure that this president and future presidents and the future department of justices do not abuse their authority in this area one reallife everyday issue where this concept comes up of the department of justice and the federal government interfering with the bank working with its legal customer would have been addressed by the perlmutter amendment that i spoke about earlier it is not just a colorado issue frankly if this bill addressed that issue despite it being overarching in other areas i would probably support it thus is the importance of this issue from local law enforcement in our state but unfortunately not even a minute not even a second of debate is allowed on the issue the gentleman from ohio claimed that we were having that debate to be clear we are not we are debating the underlying rule there is no time for the sponsors of the amendment to make their case or for opponents of the amendment to make their case we are outlaying the time for other amendments many amendments have 10 minutes many amendments have more there is not even a second for the debate of that amendment sponsored by mr perlmutter that is why i cannot support this rule 213 million americans live in a state or jurisdiction where the voters have allowed for some legal marijuana use colorado tried to solve the problem locally but we were rejected by federal banking regulators in courts so congress needs to be the one to make this change only congress can address this issue while there remains a need to align federal and state laws while the doj and treasury have issued some guidance some institutions are providing banking services to the doj and treasury guidance issues the guidance does not solve the problem which is why we need to change the law and provide certainty which this very simple amendment that has bipartisan support and likely would have passed on the floor would have done but it is completely shut down under this rule even though it furthers the actual goal of the legislation is germane to the legislation is consistent with the legislation and yet it is completely shut down in a closed process that runs contrary to the speakers stated goal of

where our local broadcasters have really made a difference in rhode island i think sometimes the best way to illustrate that is to give real examples of where that happened so for example there was a documentary made about a homeless man finding help at crossroads which is the largest homeless services organization in the state of rhode island wpritv a local broadcaster in the city of providence secured the rights to this documentary and took the opportunity to create a telethon around its airing viewers were asked to open their hearts and their pocketbooks and pledge by phone or online and that effort raised 85 000 for the shelter providing greatly needed funding as the housing crisis and economy created an evergrowing demand for the shelter services so that is one example another

commercialfree telethon preempts primetime programming and all production for the event is done inhouse by the station last year the telethon generated 500 000 from phone donations and longterm corporate commitments tied to the event and it has raised billions of dollars over the years the local newspaper and wnriam in woonsocket rhode island carry on the milk fund which is a local tradition that started in 1936 as a way to help struggling families each year through the month of december multiple fundraising efforts in woonsocket raise money toward the purchase of milk vouchers another example this past fall listeners tuned in to wkkbfm in providence for its 2day promesa y esperanzapromise and hoperadiothon which raises funds for st jude childrens hospital the broadcast is carried out in partnership with 15 sister stations throughout the country to raise awareness of childhood cancer within the hispanic community and to help st jude continue to offer treatment to all children regardless of their familys ability to pay this years effort raised more than 100 000 in wkkbs listening area alone and more than 630 000 between the 16 stations combined and just one final example lin media which owns wpritv in east providence established the minority scholarship and training program each recipient will receive a 2year scholarship for up to 10 000 per year which can be used for school expenses in addition lin media will provide each student with handson training through a paid internship program at one of its television stations around the country minority scholarship recipients are assigned fulltime positions at lin media upon graduation and successful completion of the training program so these are just some examples and i know there are examples like this all across the country where local broadcasters are really making a difference not only helping raise needed resources for nonprofit organizations getting information to listeners and viewers during emergencies but really helping to strengthen our communities and i for one want to acknowledge the local broadcasters and to say thank you i hope these examples help illustrate the value of our local

national historical park boundary act of 2016 i would like to thank my colleague congressman sanford bishop of georgia we have had many meetings in washington as well as back in the district on this particular issue certainly i have enjoyed working with him on it todays vote marks an important milestone in many years of effort to bring about increased recognition and enhance cultural preservation of the ocmulgee national monument the ocmulgee national monument was originally authorized by congress in 1934 to protect the old ocmulgee fields which includes a network of very wellpreserved indian mounds of great historical importance the history of the fields can be traced back to native americans who first came to the site during the paleoindian period to hunt ice age mammals the park is unique in that it vividly displays the story of many stages of prehistoric cultural development including the mound builder period and highlights the important role of agriculture in the region i am proud to represent this area of middle georgia along with congressman sanford bishop our offices have worked along with many regional community partners to advance this goal by expanding the current ocmulgee national monument from 700 acres to over 2 000 acres and redesignating the area as a national historic park this legislation will provide significant economic educational and cultural benefits to middle georgia additionally h r 482 will reauthorize a study for future expansions and include increased opportunities for hunting fishing camping and other recreational activities the expansion of the ocmulgee national monument area provides for critical preservation of additional archeological locations through the old ocmulgee fields because of its significant historical and archeological importance the future ocmulgee mounds national historic park must be preserved the expanded park also will generate additional tourism in middle georgia while educating visitors on the fascinating history of the many civilizations that have thrived in the region however it should be noted that the property in the proposed expansion area would be acquired only from willing donors or sellers using private funds and that no federal dollars will be used to achieve expansion i want to take this time to thank chairman bishop and ranking member grijalva as well as all the members of the house committee on natural resources for their work to bring this legislation to the floor today i want to close by noting that this legislation is a true example of what can be achieved when local state and federal leaders work together towards a common goal the ocmulgee mounds national historical park boundary act was created from the ground up with many letters of support from the

gentlewoman from the district of columbia her amendment would eliminate provisions in the government reform and improvement act that deal with holding members of the senior executive service or ses accountable for example the amendment would strike section 402 of the bill which extends the probationary period for individuals appointed to the ses from 1 to 2 years extending the probationary period allows federal agencies to ensure that senior executives they hire are suitable for the job they hold after the probationary period ends it becomes much harder to remove an ses employee not suited for the position it is in the best interests of the american people that the members of the ses be fully vetted before their appointments become final i should also note that section 1105 of the fy 2016 national defense authorization act established a 2year probationary period for new civilian hires at the department of defense this good government reform is already in place at one of the largest federal agencies and we should extend it to the rest of the federal government as well the amendment in question would also strip provisions that allow ses appointees to be removed for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service and to be suspended without pay for less than 2 weeks for misconduct these rules already apply to the vast majority of the federal civil service and they should apply to ses appointees as well in addition the gentlewomans amendment would eliminate a portion of the bill that gives agency heads authority to place on mandatory annual leave ses appointees facing removal for misconduct and prohibits the accumulation of additional leave during this period it would also eliminate a provision that gives agency heads the authority to seek removal or transfer of senior executives based on poor performance or misconduct and that would provide an expedited appeal process for the aggrieved employee the american people deserve an accountable senior

nothing like the attacks on orlando paris newtown or san bernardino ever happen again congress should immediately move forward and pass the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act this commonsense bill would prohibit suspected terrorists from possessing guns or explosives keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who wish to do our country harm is a solution that we should all be able to get behind the hateful attack in orlando also reminds us once more of the growing threat of isisinspired radical islamic terrorist on unitedstates soil is real and cannot be ignored or downplayed congress must reassert leadership in the fight against isis by passing legislation to hold the president accountable for developing a comprehensive plan to destroy isis through congressional oversight hearings we must also ensure that federal agencies and local law enforcement are effectively communicating with each other to identify international and homegrown terror threats through both traditional security approaches and social media internationally congress must act to cut off sources of funding to other radical islamic terror groups by restoring crippling sanctions on iran the recent agreement which frankly shipped billions of dollars to the worlds largest state sponsor of terror while helping finance organizations like hamas and hezbollah is simply unacceptable at home we cannot allow the tired partisan bickering to distract us from the difficult but necessary work of preventing gun violence we need to bridge the partisan divide and put the best

purchases the vast majority of the american people support this commonsense idea and it is past time congress moves forward with this proposal that will keep more people safe we also need to improve communications so that local law enforcement is notified when someone attempts to purchase a gun and fails a required background check my colleague congressman mike quigley introduced a commonsense bill to make this fix which i strongly support other important efforts to prevent gun violence include my bill with congresswoman debbie dingell to prevent domestic abusers from being able to purchase weapons this proposal would help again prohibit firearm trafficking used to evade background checks and also a longoverdue increase in mental health resources in short there are numerous commonsense

highspeed rail proposal wont be deterred by skyrocketing costs an absence of private investment or the 55 millionand growingfunding gap what we didnt know was the extent of secrecy and mismanagement taxpayers would face at the hands of state officials pushing this project just this month we learned that in 2013 the agencys main contractor projected that the first phases costs had risen 31 percent this information was concealed by the highspeed rail authority and only released 2 years later after pressure from congress while the lack of transparency is unacceptable especially given that taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for this project the fundamental issue here is that the entire project is a rusein literal terms a train wreckin that state officials knew this for some time and that those same officials hid this from the public in 2008 voters were promised an 800mile system that would link sacramento san francisco los angeles and san diego cost about 34 billion and would have less than onethird of the costs paid by the state through its taxpayers the system was promised to travel from san francisco to los angeles in under 2 hours and 40 minutes fast forward to 2011 when the price had shot up from 34 billion to 100 billion the plan was reduced to only l a to san francisco and the state was quick to grab billions ofunknown at the timefederal stimulus that came along later funding that could have been used for critical needs like roads or water infrastructure that california needs so desperately as well as now shifting capandtrade dollars recently created to try and prop up highspeed rail and its deficient budget dollars as a state senator at the time the first bill i introduced was one that would require them to come up with the ultimate full plan of the cost of doing highspeed rail having not succeeded in getting that through a majority that still liked it as it was my next legislation was to say now that we know this is over 100 billion lets put this back on the ballot and in front of the voters since the price has tripled and they were deceived at what it would cost at the time that too met defeat as those in the majority still wished to continue this boondoggle today the governor claims the price has fallen to 68 billion for what would be an illegal system based on what the voters passed under prop 1a however the estimate ignores the costs of tunneling through the tehachapi mountains ignores cost spikes in the initial construction segment and ignores the rising costs of lands acquisition due to people having to fight because they are having their homes their farms and their small businesses paved over by this project the promises made in 2008 ranged from low ticket prices to questionable job figures including the fact that they were claiming there would be a million new jobs from highspeed rail when we pinned them down in committee a little bit later they said well that would mean a million jobyears that number has since been pared down all these have been proven false in fact these claims are so misleading that a state court has forbidden the legislature from writing ballot measure descriptions earlier this week i sent out a survey to residents in my weekly enewsletter to constituents in californias first district my own district asking them to share their thoughts on highspeed rail as it is now i listed a number of suggested actions we could take on highspeed rail from leaving it as is to defunding it and asked which best represents our constituents position on the project now of the nearly 1 600 answers we received their views are pretty clear nearly half of them said they thought funding for highspeed rail should be redirected to invest in water storage and water infrastructure to help our state right now in this drought about 20 percent thought the state should subpoena the cost documents and require highspeed rail authority officials to testify why the figures were concealed approximately 18 percent thought californias highspeed rail should undergo federal investigation in response to these allegations given that the project involves the use of federal funds a scant 7 percent thought we should keep going forward with highspeed rail and believed the current price tag is a worthwhile investment of public funds lastly 4 percent supported investing in highspeed rail provided the project stayed within the old constraints the old pricesthe ones they saw on the ballot so at best you see 11 percent that might support highspeed rail and 4 percent that might under the old price which is nowhere near what was projected people dont like this project dont trust those advocating for it and they deserve better than to see their own tax dollars used to lie to them no new federal dollars will come from here to help this project be propped up anymore it is time we start prioritizing funding for projects that actually address real problems facing california such as the current drought it is time to apply common sense to this situation we have a state whose economy depends on a sound water supply yet in the midst of a historic drought we are still chasing this

the concern and the attention that he has given to all of our veterans throughout our country i want to thank representative butterfield and the other members of the committee for the strong bipartisan support that this legislation enjoys on the floor today jason was born in stevens point wisconsin in 1978 in my congressional district he is the son of marvin and linda simcakoski he is a graduate of stevens point pacelli high school shortly after his graduation he joined the marine corps where he reached the rank of corporal receiving the sea service deployment ribbon with one star a certificate of commendation the rifle sharp shooters badge and the good conduct medal he was honorably discharged in february of 2002 jason loved being a marine and he was very proud to serve his country he married heather in 2010 in stevens point and they had a beautiful daughter named anaya i am proud that many members of jasons family came out to washington this week to see the passage of this bill today his mother linda his wife heather his daughter anaya who are in the chamber with us today his father marvin who was also intimately involved in helping draft this legislation and see it through was unfortunately unable to attend but i commend all of them because this is how legislation is meant to work by reaching out to veterans organizations getting direct feedback from the veterans themselves their families healthcare providers we have known for some time that we have had a pain management problem not just in the va medical system but throughout our entire healthcare system this unfortunately came to light through numerous investigations at the tomah va medical center over the course of the last few years which ultimately helped and precipitated the legislation that we have before us today jasons familys guiding star in all of this based on the numerous conversations that i have had with them and that they have had with chairman bilirakis and even with speaker ryan was to ensure that the care and the treatment that our veterans receive be enhanced so that no veteran and no family would have to go through and endure what they did jason was receiving pain management and was under the opioid medication at tomah this legislation i think advances that goal i dont think anyone can be here with absolute certitude and promise a family or future veterans that mistakes wont happen in the future but i think what is contained in this legislation is a significant step in the right direction with the understanding that more work is needed the bill would require a review and an update of the vas clinical practice guideline for the management of opioid therapy for chronic pain it requires all opioid prescribers at the va to have enhanced pain management and safe opioid prescribing education and training it improves the realtime tracking of and access to data on the opioid use of veterans in order to prevent overmedication it provides additional resources to assist the vas ability to counter overdoses it expands the opioid safety initiative to all va medical facilities it updates the joint working group of the va and dod to focus on opioid prescribing practices the use of alternative pain therapy and the coordination when a servicemember transitions from the dod into the va care setting it also encourages the use of alternative and complementary forms of pain management lastly it requires the va to report on prescription rates so we can better assess the problem and find solutions this is a work in progress not just within the va system not just with the reforms that are currently being implemented at the tomah va medical center in my congressional district but throughout the entire healthcare system we as a nation have not done a very good job of managing pain at all levels i am glad and i am proud that this congress sees the need to move forward on a comprehensive opioid legislation bill hopefully we can get that to the finish line yet this year there is also a major va reform bill that we are working onexcellent vehicles in order to include some of the provisions of this legislation as we move

us that hope and gives us that opportunity i couldnt think of a more powerful legacy in jasons name than this legislation i ask all of my colleagues to give their support of this legislation today
