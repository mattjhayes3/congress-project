important issue for all of th country but especially true among ms 3 farmers and ranchers in kansas i am one who supports renewable fuels and ethanol and soy diesel pro 1 vide a great opportunity for economi u opportunity in kansas fot kansa farmers and for american agricultur f and for our country we must becom u much more independent from the en s ergy sources abroad but for our farmers and ranchers to remain in business to survive into the future they have got to have access to natural gas and at prices that are affordable natural gas is the primary feed stock the ingredient for the production of many agricultural components but especially for nitrogen fertilizer that is so important and if we are going to produce ethanol in this country if we are going to produce soy diesel we are going to have to have the fertilizer at an affordable price that will allow our farmers to raise the corn and grain sorghum to produce the ethanol to raise the soy beans to produce the soy diesel our farmers are struggling across the country input costs are dramatically on the rise nearly 40 percent of the nitrogen capacity fertilizer capacity has been shut down in this country since 1999 six years ago approximately 15 percent of our fertilizer needs were met in the united states from abroad today 50 percent is imported prices have increased dramatically 250 a ton for nitrogen fertilizer in 2002 today 416 one of my farmers who farms in southwest kansas 30 years ago when he started farming natural gas was 19 cents today it is 9 we are seeing double triple and even fourfold prices that donny young talks about in trying to stay in business with these increasing input costs while the price of corn has stayed the same we in the united states need to become independent if we are going to produce the ethanol and it is important that we remember that natural gas is necessary to make that nitrogen fertilizer i encourage the adoption of this proposal a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture agricultures ability to produce an affordable food supply will continue to face huge obstacles if our nation does not come to grips with its desire to have limitless resources like natural gas for production and not realize that these resources have to come from somewhere our natural gas crisis has two solutionsincrease supply and reduce demand h r 4761 addresses one aspect of this crisis as it will increase the supply of natural gas from the outer continental shelf this additional supply will do two things it will send a strong signal to natural gas markets and could increase the elasticity in north american natural gas markets it indicates to these futures markets that the united states is committed to lifting the moratoria in the outer continental shelf to provide consumers with an additional supply of natural gas this message should ease the volatility in natural gas prices that all of us have seen since 1999 and the additional supply should help ease the natural gas prices over time why does agriculture care so much about this natural gas crisis simply put agriculture is a very large consumer of natural gas farm3 ers use significant amounts of natural gas for food processing irrigation crop drying heating farm buildings and homes and for the pro duction of crop protection chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers natural gas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers manufactured in the untied states natural gas is not just an energy source it is the raw material for producing the fertilizer today in the case of the nitrogen fertilizer anhydrous ammonia natural gas accounts for over 90 percent of the total cash cost of production just like kansas wheat and wisconsin milk fertilizer is a commodity bought and sold worldwide and subject to basic global supply and demand economic principles as the unitedstates domestic nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing sector declines due to high natural gas prices kansas farmers and other unitedstates food producers will be subject to global supply demand forces on the fertilizer products they buy even more so than today the climb in natural gas prices since 2q00 has forced unitedstates fertilizer production costs to unprecedented levels over this period of high prices and intense volatility the unitedstates fertilizer industry began to shut down production nearly 40 percent of the industrys nitrogen capacity permanently shut down between 1999 and today this has and will continue to make unitedstates farmers dependent on offshore production from the major suppliers such as saudi arabia venezuela and russia this rise in natural gas prices and the permanent closure of so much unitedstates fertilizer production has dramatically impacted fertilizer prices throughout the marketing chain and in particular at the farm level according to usda unitedstates prices to farmers for ammonia climbed from 250 per ton in 2002 to 416 per ton in 2005 that is almost a doubling of the price of ammonia to farmers this continued loss of production from the unitedstates nitrogen fertilizer industry would force farmers to rely on a highly uncertain and highly volatile world market with no assurance that they will be able to obtain enough product to meet their full demand this is particularly important when considering the importance of nitrogen to farmers thirty to 50 percent of corn yields are directly attributed to nitrogen fertilizer passing h r 4761 represents a direct positive action to increase our nations domestic natural gas supply to help relieve the high prices pressuring american farmers fertilizer producers and homeowners allowing exploration and development of the outer continental shelf is an essential commitment that our nation must make these natural resources belong to all americans and should be developed for the benefit of the entire nation a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture please support passage of h

voices on behalf of limited federal government limited federal expenditures and i am proud that he has come out tonight to help us with this let me flush out what he was talking about in terms of increased federal receipts back in january of this year the cbo estimated that fiscal year 2005s tax receipts federal receipts would be about 2 045 trillion cbo is an organization that gets paid to try to estimate these things they generally do a really good job when we finished out the year i was looking at the same treasury report that my colleague made reference to awhile ago and for fiscal year 2005 which ended september 30 2005 receipts were 2 153 trillion over 100 billion more in federal tax receipts than we had estimated just 9 months previously so the numbers we have been talking about tonight the 50 billion in tax cuts the 56 billion and the impact extending the current tax law will have on tax revenues pale against over 108 to 109 billion of increased federal revenues that has come about as a result of the progrowth projob creation tax policy that was put in collectively in 2001 to 2003 in addition to that good news at the end of last week the gdp growth for the third quarter of calendar year 2005 was 4 3 percent that is a good growth rate on any economy a developing economy or whatever it is but let us make sure that we understand this is on the single largest economy in the world it grew 4 3 percent in the third quarter and that is staggering growth under any conclusion fl 2215 the unemployment rate was mentioned earlier as being as low as 5 percent that is full unemployment in reckoning of many economists and is certainly lower than the averages of unemployment of the previous 3 decades the decade of the 1970s which you remember we had a big depression then and as a result of a runup in oil and gas prices we had lower than in the 1980s when those of us in the oil business experienced a significant downturn in 1986 and later and then lower than the boom years of the 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as anybody thought it would ever be the current unemployment rate is actually lower than that statistics are full of all kind of odd and important indexes that statisticians and economists use to try to make projections as to where the economy is going one of those that you do not hear a lot about is the consumer confidence index and that is supposed to be a measure of how consumers feel about themselves are they going to go spend money do they feel comfortable with their job and those kinds of things it jumped from an 85 2 percent rating in october to a 98 9 percent rating in november a 1month jump of over 13 points in consumer confidence what that tells us is that retailers for the christmas season ought to do very well one of my colleagues today said go try to find a parking spot in the mall these days and for all of the doom and gloom that is out there in the media it is not being reflected in americans going to the malls and working on christmas gifts and charity gifts for other folks that do not have it so the consumer confidence is up another statistic that gets talked about a little bit is that sales of new homes jumped 13 percent in october the largest 1 month percentage gain in 12 years and new singlefamily homes also climbed to an alltime record high of 1 42 million units more people again as we have said several times tonight more people owning a home in america than have ever owned a home now 1 month does not make a trend but continuing to talk about federal tax receipts and revenues the first month of fiscal year 2006 was the month of october of 2005 and during that first month federal tax receipts were about 149 billion and a year ago the equivalent month in october of fiscal 2005 which was october of 2004 federal tax receipts was 137 billion so a 12 billion gain in just 1 month against previous years months now you have got to be careful that may or may not be a trend but it is hard to say it is bad news thai the tax receipts for october of this year are greater than tax receipts for october of last year i think that is good news i would also like to point out a couple of tax provisions that are included in the extension that we will do later on this week that are important and one of those would continue the tax deduction for state and local sales taxes for states that do not have a state income tax states like yours and mine and my former colleague texas does not have a state income tax and so this provision would allow texans to deduct rather than the state income taxes to deduct state and local taxes which are used to fund many of the exact same programs that states who have income taxes use those taxes to provide goods and services to their citizens another deduction that is extended is the abovetheline deduction for higher education expenses now trying not to bore everyone with tax returnese or speak abovetheline deductions means that you get to detect that without having to itemize your deductions so higher education expenses the deduction for that is continued as well as an important expenditure for many teachers who find the school budgets do not provide some of the extras and maybe even sometimes some of the essentials that a teacher needs in providing a good classroom experience for her students teachers get to deduct their outofpocket expenses above the line which means they dont have to itemize deductions to get to deduct those personal expenses that the teacher may pay one that i came across tonight or an example of one i came across tonight is the tax incentive to revitalize the district of columbia included in the code of the past two tax cuts has been a 5 000 tax credit for anyone any new first time home purchaser here in the district of columbia well one of the folks on my staff who as you know staff are legendarily overworked and way underpaid one of the folks on my staff 2 years ago took advantage of this provision and bought his first home and has begun to build equity in that home over the past 2 years and would not have been able to do that were this tax provision not in place when you sell a home you have bought it from somebody who previously owned it hopefully and in all likelihood that person is going to go invest that money in another home so it is important that we have firsttime buyers to work into the market work into the housing market because as we stated earlier for many families the ownership of a home is the single largest asset that they have in their portfolio and this gentleman now has a home that he is paying a mortgage on of course but is building equity in that home building equity in his personal wealth and he is going to be better off as a result of having done that let me talk about something that we probably should have talked about right off the bat and that is the federal government does not grow this economy a lot of times the federal government gets a lot more credit for good economic news than it deserves and in all likelihood sometimes a lot more of the blame for bad economies than it deserves but the truth of the matter is a growing economy that we have right now is not created by a federal government it was created by hundreds of thousands of hard working americans employees who go to work every day and work for their employer to try to provide a good or a service that that employer can sell and make money on selfemployed individuals who have gone out there and taken the business risk of leaving that paycheck leaving the security of a check every 2 weeks to try to make it on their own those are the folks who are building this growing economy who are adding people to their payrolls who are hiring new people or setting up additional businesses to take advantage of opportunities that we are having in this growing economy so we cannot overstate the value of the hard working american in growing this economy but we do have some risks a lot of times of overstating the impact the federal government has in my view the role of the federal government is to get out of the way of these hardworking americans and let them continue to grow this economy pay their fair share of taxes of course but let us not do things that puts the government in the way of creating jobs gets in the way of furthering homeownership gets in the way of growing this economy and providing new opportunities for men and women in this country i participated in back in the early 1990s in a needs assessment for midland texas this was an attempt to survey on a statistically valid basis throughout midland county what were the needs of people within midland what were the needs of your family what were the needs in your neighborhood what were the needs within the overall community and we got all of this information together and began to sort them into like items and pared the list down to 10 so that we had in fact 10 top needs that the people in midland texas told us they were having in their homes their families their neighborhoods and the community and as you look down that list nine of those needs would have been positively impacted by a family that had a job it has been my experience that jobs cure an awful lot of ills within every community when families are working the family itself is better off communities are better off the strains on the social network that is the united way that is all those social charities that we have in place to create that safety net that is so vital in every single one of our communities is less strained when more people have jobs it is also better supported when more people have jobs so it is important that we give credit where credit is due with respect to this growing economy the gentleman from texas mentioned one of his or three actually of his constituents that are good examples of why these pro growth pro job creation tax policies are in effect now and that we ought to continue them in effect i want to talk about calvin fryar calvin is a good friend of mine from brownwood texas he and his partners own a company that distributes gasoline they also have convenience stores they hire people to work and he told me the other day at dinner that because we were talking about extension of these current tax cuts he said that the one that was the most important to him as a small business owner was the section 179 deduction section 179 provides for the immediate writeoff of certain equipment that is purchased by businesses and put into use each year and i think it is about 100 000 calvin told me that when that came into effect i think it was 2003 that it helped him make a decision to invest additional money into the businesses that he was trying to create and not only did he invest the amount of money that qualified him to immediately deduct that amount he also invested a lot of money on top of that and in doing so created jobs and not only did he create jobs for the people who built whatever it is he bought but he also created additional jobs for his company because he was expanding his opportunities within the gasoline distribution area as well as convenience stores so he was adding jobs to his business as a result of that one specific tax code that is expiring and under the tax law that we will pass hopefully pass on thursday will be continued another one of those that is very important and my colleagues earlier in the previous hour mentioned it and that is the tax rate on capital gains and dividends if you were to listen to the colleagues on the other side it is as if the federal government has some innate claim to some portion of your capital gains some portion of your dividends and i would argue that that is not logical where is it stated anywhere that the federal government has a claim on selling property that you have held selling property that you have invested in selling a business that you built from scratch why is it that the federal government has a claim to a certain amount of that and right now under the current tax law the federal government has a claim on 15 percent of that capital gain or 15 percent of those dividends that may or may not be correct it is the law of the land but certainly increasing that number you would have to answer the question is all right why does the federal government have a claim on or does it own in some way the capital gain that i get when i sell stocks and bonds or when i sell a business why is it that the other side believes that a higher tax rate on capital gains is somehow some right of the federal government that is not if we were to let those current tax provisions expire capital gains would get thrown back up to the previously high percentage rates everything is going to get thrown back in with ordinary income the taxable income rates and we will be right back into a circumstance where we are raising taxes the wrong way raising taxes by raising rates as opposed to raising taxes by having an economy that is growing at a staggering rate providing new jobs to workers in this country so i would argue against that as we close out this hour if you look at the reporting we are talking about the economy tonight and if you look at reporting of economic news it is i guess an attempt to be balanced balance is rarely neutral though you will hear somebody talk about well you know this economic statistic is looking up and looking better but if that path continues it will drive us into higher interest rates or if we have got increased job growth or jobs going to be created at too fast a rate then that is going to drive up inflation so it is rare that you ever have good economic news simply presented as good economic news and maybe we will never get to a point where that happens hopefully on the nights that we get to come in here and talk about the economy get to brag on the economy actually we will be able to help set the record straight as i mentioned earlier my good colleague mr hensarling has said often that we are all entitled to our own opinion but we are only entitled to one set of facts not our own set of facts just the set of facts as are out there hopefully we can be responsible for what we say in front of these microphones be held accountable for what we say the other side made a lot tonight about accountability and all those kinds of things i would argue that that same accountability ought to go to things that are said from behind these microphones if i have said something that is incorrect if i have made an insinuation or made some sort of a comment that was intended to mislead that i am called to account for that and i would hope the other side would ascribe to that same kind of philosophy that the folks in the chamber tonight who are listening to this debate or listening to these arguments not really debate since we are not going back and forth but listening to the three of us put out information that we believe is important for the american people to hear and to understandand to understand how we are coming to the conclusions that we are coming too that we be held to a very high standard of what we say and that we are able to back up each and everything that we do say with facts that are verifiable so i want to thank you tonight for being able to lead this hour and i want to thank my colleague from texas mr hensarling for his role in our talk tonight and i want to also thank my freshman colleague from georgia mr price for his helping nie out tonight as well so the message i would leave with the american people is this that we have got a growing economy we have got an economy that is well grounded and is going to sustain this growth but that what we do not need to do is to increase taxes tax rates on that economy but that we continue the pro growth pro job creation tax rates that have been in effect since 2001 and 2003 e 2230"], [0.0023159205447882414,

amazed at news reports at home when i go home and i watch television news and i read the newspaper and see what is being portrayed as usual for the american public if you just followed those stories you would not believe that there was anything that was good or positive going on in our nation you would not believe that the economy for example was doing very very well so one of the things that i try to do and i know others try to do as well is to try to assist and bring about some truth in reporting so tonight what we would like to do is spend a little time talking about the economy for the american people know better than what they see on the nightly news and what they read in the newspapers in fact so many of the folks that i talk to at home are really tired of the gloom and doom that gets reported on the news and frankly gets stated over and over and over here in congress by some members they are tired of congressmen and women who put politics and partisanship over good policy and i hear so often back home that folks say why cant you just get something done on behalf of the american people well a lot of good things are getting done and we are going to spend a little time tonight talking about our economy and some things that congress is doing and has done to assist the american people to help american families to help american children to help american communities it is important that we do that because there is good news to tell so what we would like to do is spend a little time tonight and review so many of the positive things that have been done to create really an economy that is on the move i would like to begin by just sharing a number of different charts that demonstrate clearly that the economy is growing this is a chart here that i think really crystallizes so many of the good stories that we have to tell this chart begins in the first quarter of 2001 and along this axis here is the annual change in gdp or gross domestic product that is how well is the economy doing as you see for the first number of quarters of 2001 and 2002 it is kind of going along kind of bumping up and down and then there is a remarkable change that occurs in early 2003 from then on from the second quarter of 2003 on what we see is a gross domestic product growth in every quarter 10 quarters in a row of a growth of greater than 3 percent and oftentimes greater than 4 percent in faqt the most recent quarter grew at a rate of 4 3 percent the individual who wants to know how to continue that kind of growth and who is excited about policies that encourage growth would say well what happened what happened at that point to bring that kind of growth about as most people know what happened was that the tax cuts the tax relief that congress enacted on behalf of the hardworking american taxpayers went into effect and that has resulted in this incredible incredible growth in the economy that continues that continues unabated and what congress has an opportunity to do this week is to continue and extend that tax relief hopefully to be able to continue the lines that we have seen grow in the economy this is another chart that demonstrates the kind of response that the american economy has to that kind of activity this talks about the creation of new jobs in our country in fact since the spring of 2003 there have been 4 46 million new jobs that have come about and this chart shows the percent increase each month from early 2002 through the current time you see again there is that remarkable change that occurs in the early part and midparet of 2003 where the growth in the number of jobs is remarkable again the inquiring individual would want to know well what changed there what made it so that we did not have negative growth in jobs we had positive growth in jobs as everybody well knows now that change was the tax relief the tax relief that congress enacted that took place in early 2003 just to put those numbers all together this chart which is a little busy shows two very clearly distinct lines one is the green line down here that is the number of jobs that increase in our nation each month the red line is the level of unemployment and as you see at the beginning of 2003 the unemployment rate was taken up here somewhere around 6 percent and the number of jobs began to increase at this point when the tax relief package went into effect we see that continued increase and in fact right now the unemployment rate is down at 5 percent which is lower than the average for the decades of the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s some economists will tell you that 5 percent unemployment rate is full employment because you have got a number of folks who are between jobs or are working to find other places of employment that is their design so 5 percent is basically full employment the number of new jobs that was created last month 215 000 new jobs so there is good news to tell i have been joined tonight by many of my colleagues and many of them will share some of the same kinds of goodnews stories with you first i would like to yield the time to congresswoman blackburn from tennessee she has been such an incredible leader in this congress in the area of tax relief and in making certain that we enact the kinds of policies here that result in smaller government lower taxes and more opportunity

were 5 000 feet up in the mountains along the border california shares with mexico at 2 00 freezing in 30degree weather with the wind howling in our faces eight shivering young men illegal aliens in their late teens and early 20s sat on the cold ground in handcuffs grateful to be caught one of them pleaded with the border patrol agent to find his girlfriend maria who was still stuck on one of the cliffs illegal aliens like the ones i saw in handcuffs contifnue to enter the united states from the mexican border at the rate of 8 000 per day today we have 11 milliof illegal aliens in the united states illegal immigration presents a huge problem that is why i decided to spend a week along the southern border to see firsthand how bad the problem was and what congress could do to fix it last year our border patrol agents arrested 1 2 million illegal aliens attempting to enter the united states from mexico significantly 155 000 of those arrested were from countries other than mexico they included illegal immigrants from iran iraq and afghanistan our porous mexicanunitedstates border offers the perfect cover for terrorists especially since tighter controls have been imposed at airports this poses a very serious national security problem according to cia director porter goss i personally spoke with border patrol agents who had apprehended suspects on the terrorist watch list one night while i was riding along with the border patrol two illegals from pakistan were captured one convicted sexualpredator was caught trying to cross so were wanted murder suspects drug dealers and smugglers i was impressed by the bravery of the border patrol agents who escorted me i saw a border patrol supervisor get out of his vehicle pull an illegal alien off of a 10foot wall and arrest him despite his violent attempts to resist the arrest the border patrol agent i rode with told me he had been shot at on several occasions twentythree of his colleagues have been killed in the line of duty since 1990 for example border patrol agents susan rodriguez and ricardo salinas were gunned down by a murder suspect agent jefferson barr was shot to death by a drug trafficker if the job of a border patrol agent sounds dangerous imagine the risk to people who actually live along the border i sat down in the living rooms of four different families who own ranches along the border one couple ed and donna tisdale documented on home video 13 000 illegal aliens crossing their property in one year alone the tisdales had their barbedwire fences cut by illegals running off the familys cattle when their dogs barked to scare off intruders the dogs were poisoned another rancher told me about numerous breakins at his home while his family slept as illegal aliens tried to find food and clothing one morning his daughters had gone out to feed their pet bunnies only to find them skinned and taken for food by illegal aliens trying to escape to a nearby highway the economic impact of crossers who are successful is catastrophic illegal immigration costs taxpayers 45 billion per year in health care education and incarceration expenses the cost of the estimated 630 000 illegal aliens in florida is about 2 billion a year meaning every familyin my congressioral district pays a hidden tax of 315 each year ald yet still faces depressed wages because of illegal immigration so how do we fix the problem first we need to crack down on employers who knowingly hire illegal workers jobs are the magnet drawing illegal aliens across the border and the united states house of representatives has acted to make it mandatory for employers to check the paperwork of new hires or else face stiff penalties if they do not now it is up to the senate to act second we need to complete construction of the double fence for 700 miles along the border near populated urban areas san diego saw a steep reduction in crossings from 500 000 down to 130 000 when the double fence was completed there third where mountains and rugged terrain make completion of a double fence impossible we need to have a virtual fence congress needs to appropriate more money for infrared cameras that enable agents to see the entire border finally we need more bordef patrol agents although congress has tripled the number of border patrol agents since the late 1980s more are still needed one million illegal im migrants come to america legally each year and my staff members spend the majority of their time helping those who want to come to our country to work hard and play by the rules e3 1900 we are protected from dangerous people entering the country at our airports ids are checked against the terrorist watch list and baggage is screened well who is doing the checks on the 8 000 people who arrive here illegally every day who is our last line of defense it is a bbrder patrol agent in a green uniform working alone at 2 tonight after all of us are asleep he will be working somewhere near the top of a cold 5 000foot mountain along the californiamexican border he will get a radio call telling him to approach a group of illegals who have been spotted by an infrared scope and are located near the top of that mountain he will track their footprints in the dirt and make hisway toward them as he approaches there is something he doesnt know are these illegal aliens a group of harmless teenagers who are scared and freeziig or are they heavily~armed and dangerous drug traffickers like the ones who have killed so many of his colleagues either way he will approach them because it is another day on

because i hustled over here to arrive at the appointed time and i thank my colleagues hopefully they filibustered a few minutes on my behalf as good friends likely would i would like to speak to you about a few issues about border control especially on the southern border and primarily on the southern border i have long spoken about the policy that i think we need to have with regard to the immigration policy across the nation about domestic enforcement and shutting off the jobs magnet and also about the need to stop the bleeding at our southern border and so i had gone down to the border about a year ago and spent a long weekend down there at least 3 days on the ground and in the air as a guest of the border patrol hnd some of the other agencies that operate the security along the border and i was given a very good tour and a few rides in helicopters at night and also in the daytime shining the night sun down along our bbrder to identify where there might be illegals that have come across or future illegals preparing to come across and i stopped and visited some of the stations and their equipment and talked to the men i was impressed with the quality of the team people that they had assembled the equipment they had assembled and the tactics they had yet in that full long weekend i did not actually see activity which would indicate to a reasonable person that there was not activity to be seen in spite all of those hours in the air and the hours on the ground and the night vision equipment i did not again see any illegal activities although i got many reports of the success of the interdictionof our border patrol and our other agencies well as i listen to the debate here in the house of representatives and the testimony that comes before the immigration subcommittee which i sit upon and i sit in those hearings two three even four times a week and we will have four sometimes eight witnesses giving us credible data and good wellinformed information on this issue from both sides of the issue and always the years the cumulative information has built in me after those years of sitting on the immigration subcommittee i began to think that i have a pretty decent broad background on the subject and yet there was a gap there was a gap in that subject because i had not gone down and spent time on the border more or less unguided moreor less outside the scope of the border patrol but gone ahead and gone down to the border and looked under all the stones and met with the people that were actually more likely to be more frank with me so that was my mission this past weekend where i spent perhaps as much as 4 days on the ground in arizona and the goal was to meet with the people that are enforcing our laws down there the ones that are out in the night and those people who have seen this bleeding this hemorrhaging at our border firsthand that can describe to me the scope of the bleeding in our southern border i am here to say tonight that it is astonishing it is far worse than i had imagined and my imagination was fairly strong my predictions and the numbers that i put out were fairly aggressive at least viewed by some of my critics but there is nothing i saw down on the border over the weekend that would cause me to believe that i have overstated the numbers of people who are illegally crossing our border or the amount of drugs illegal drugs that are coming across our border or the amount of violence that is visited because of the drug problem both south of the border north of the border and the violence that goes throughout the drug culture in america and the collateral damage to the victims that may not be associate with that at all but happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are victims of murder victims of negligent homicide generally in the form of a car accident where the driver who was at fault was under the influence of alcohol or drugs so what i did was go down to visit in a region starting out on friday in a region south of tucson south and a little bit east of tucson i first met with a special agent who briefed me on a lot of information that had been coming by this individual on a consistent basis and then i went to bisbee arizona where i went on down then to the border there to naco arizona right on the border with mexico that is a location that has seen a fair amount of violence and a lot of concentration of illegal traffic going along the border they finaljy decided to establish and build a fence i was guided to that location by a retired border patrol officer and a rancher from that region both with a passion of patriotism for america both that have a memory of growing up in an america and that part of arizona that was a different kind of country than it is today it was then a place that they could feel safe in their streets and safe in their homes and walk the streets and not lock their homes and today that region has been flooded with just thousands and tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of illegals many of them carrying illegal drugs through that region and cars drive across the border where sometimes there had been an existing fence that was built originally to contain livestock that fence has essentially been systematically broken down and vehicles with drugs and illegals in them would drive right through the gaps in the fence sometimes drive through the fence and take off across the desert or cut across over to a highway and get up on the highway and once they were on the highway for a little ways they were gone they were free they were in america not ever to be captured again not ever to be accountable again unless they were just simply victims of bad luck they realized the magnitude of this problem at naco arizona and went in and built a fence through there it is built out of interlocking steel that sometimes ean be 10 feet high or higher and then above that in some cases they have welded a kind of wire mesh that goes up another 4 to 6 feet and when they originally built the fence people said it would not work it cannot work people will go over it they will go through they will go under it or they will go around it in fact they do go around it at one point they picked up a cutting torch and cut a hole through it and made their own gate in that solid steel fence and that was a pathway by which people and drugs traveled into the united states and some went back through that gate and the patrol went there and welded the gate shut and as they kept some maintenance up on the fence the other side essentially gave up on trying to breech the fence 2230 now the illegal traffic goes around the end as one reason rather than trying to find a way through a barrier that is a good solid barrier that has been very very effective the border patrol officer whom i was there with and the rancher whom i was there with said look at this and they described the problem they used to have about the thousands of people pouring across there they said we do not have that problem anymore this community is safer than it was it is more secure than it was there is far less illegal traffic going through here there is far less crime of all kinds far less violence and far fewer illegal drugs in this community brecause we built a barrier that kept the elements out that were eroding our quality of life in naco arizona that was an interesting trip and they took me out along the border where that fence essentially stops and diminishes in some locations there is nothing there not even a way to define where the border is between the united states and mexico but simply open places where illegals can walk across the border and one location just in a dry river bed or they would not be seen by night vision they were protected by the shrubbery and vegetation they could simply walk down from mexico into the united states unimpeded unobstructed unobserved and become shadow people here in the united states doing whatever they do they were strong advocates of the border barrier and one that is solidly built and one that can be efficient and is becoming a tool that could very much support our law enforcement and let them focus their energy on plans that could be more effective than riding herd on a broad length of an unprotected border it is ridiculous to think that we could ever hire enough people to sit along the border especially at night and watch people come across and then catch them rather than put in a fence that would not allow them to come across in the first place that was naco arizona and again i learned a lot about the culture and the level of corruption on the south side of the border it was an interesting conversation from there i went down then to the reservation and was a guest of a number of the shadow wolves who are part of the customs and border patrol actually today they are a part of the border patrol they have been shifted to that but it is on the tohono oodham reservation and on the reservation the native americans control that land they have support of the border patrol but they have had an organization there called the shadow wolves they are federal employees and their responsibility is to guard the border and interdict illegal drugs and illegal aliens they are focusing on illegal drugs their peak recruitment the top numbers there were 22 and when they were 22 strong in fact that does not sound like a very large group given the size of the reservation and given the miles of border that they have to protect and i believe that number is 76 miles of border protected and controlled by 22 shadow wolves members of the tohono oodham tribe on the reservation but those 22 in the period of a year i have got to dig up the statistics so i will be able to release those and publish those but the information i received that they had intefdicted more illegal drugs in a 12month period of time with 22 of their shadow wolves than all 2 000 border patrol agents did in that entire sector for the same period of time that is an extraordinary example of effectiveness and efficiency and it is the kind of thing that we here in this congress need to endorse and support and encourage and fund and authorize and protect and encourage and enhance do all of things that we can do to identify the best among us to encourage them to grow that gulture off beyond the bounds of the reservation take that same culture of efficiency and enforcement on to the other reservations whether native american tribes that control land on our national boundaries with our neighbors and the level of success that has been there has not been rewarded it has not been encouraged it has not been enhanced by the border patrol who seems to want to be seeking to undermine their efforts and absorb them into the broader border patrol in which case if they did that the shadow wolves would lose their identity these people have an extraordinary amount of character and courage and conviction and pride in what they do but like anyone if they do not see a reward for that if they do not see some kindof encouragement if they do not understand that here in congress we are supporting them eventually they will be assimilated into the border patrol and their level of efficiency will be assimilated into the broader overall level of efficiency in the border patrol now i do not mean to imply that the border patrol is not efficient or that they may not have the kind of personnel that i would like to see in fact they have some very extraordinarily brave noble hardworking officers and many of them the structure has become big and it has become difficult to be efficient so i am not here to discourage them i am here to encourage them and i often shake their hands and thank them for what they do because they are the last line of defense along our border to protect us from the incursions of millions that take place in this country every single night but what i saw from the shadow wolves was not ohly some of the history in their legacy and their efficiency and effectiveness but i went out in the field with them and watched the way that they follow the border when they see that there has been a border crossing there they will pick up that sound that track if you will and they will follow that track down and hunt down the illegals sometimes they are carrying backpacks of illegal drugs sometimes they are just people entering the united states illegally but they will find that track and get on a trot and follow that track and trace them to where they are pick them up and detain them and then process them in a fashion in accordance with law again their effort has been extraordinary in some of the things that they showed and taught me too much to go in depth here on the floor of the house of representatives but quite a lot of extraordinary skill that appears to me would be very constructive if it could be passed along to other agencies out there particularly the broader border patrol but the culture is there as well as more important the skills to protect the culture of the shadow wolves it is extraordinary i was impressed with what they do and i intend to support and encourage and enhance them i will be looking for a way legislatively to demonstrate my commitment to their commitment to protect our border and defend us against the illegal incursions into the united states and the thousands and thousands of pounds of illegal drugs that come across ourborder every single day many of them still pouring through the tohono oodham reservation and in spite of the best efforts of the nowshrunken shadow wolves down from 22 to 16 to cover those 76 miles of border fence so again i have been extraordinarily impressed but they have done their job from there i traveled outside the reservation and went over then jo the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge and met with some people there some national parks people and department of the interior forest rangers seventyfive percent of their work which they signed up to do would be to protect our natural resources preserve our parks enhance our parks let mother nature be enhanced there so that the visiting public could come into these locations like the cabeza prieta national refuge and be able to appreciate mother nature in its purest form that is why our forest rangers and our park officers got into the business because they appreciate wildlife they appreciate our plant life they appreciate how the species of nature have balanced in these regions and how they have grown and they try to enhance that they find that 75 percent of their time their border patrol officers even 75 percent of their time is spent protecting the border 75 percent of the time keeping illegals and illegal drugs out of the park not a successful effort i might add and perhaps a futile effort but an effort that needs to be attempted nonetheless with dozens and dozens of abandoned vehicles sitting out across the national wildlife refuge vehicles that have blazed a trail through there and hundreds of miles of roads have been carved through that national wildlife refuge because that was the most expeditious route for smugglers to drive their suburbans and their 4wheel drive pickups and you name your vehicle there and there will be somebody else behind you and the next night another and another and another that formerly pristine desert turns into sometimes a 200foot wide path after it has been pounded in the desert with traffic enough times it turns into what they call moon dust just loose dust that lays there in ruts in a way that you can get stuck in that dust 200 feet wide perhaps before this was a few less than 10 years ago in fact starting about 1998 was when these border incursions began and when they began to create these roads and these trails and tear up our natural resources the people that are dying in an attempt to get across the desert have gone from a couple of years ago or 3 years ago 150 175 a year now across our southern border as many as 450 a year do not make it across the desert when they seek to walk into the united states they die of hypothermia they die of exposure they die of dehydration more dehydration than anything else the desert is not very forgiving and some of them are not very well prepared they are not very wellguided and that human tragedy is exacerbated by the damage to our natural resources which i had a i will say less than enhanced appreciation for i really learned to respect and appreciate the work that is done by our department of the interior as well as the value of the resources that they are seeking to protect a case in point i think illustrates this better than anything else would be a rare species of a bat a long nose bat and this is an endangered species it only lives and reproduces in four caves and those caves are all down in that region one of those caves was a cave that was frequented consistently by the illegals who would go up into the region and then their guide and their track would take them to this cave where the baby bats were born they began taking a stop off and temporary residence in the cave to the point where they scared the bats off and they would not come back in the long nose bat the lesser long nose bat left the cave would not come back to reproduce and so our national park service looked at that situation said we have to protect this resource and if this happens in the other three caves there will be no place for these bats to reproduce who knows if they will become extinct so they put up a wrought iron fence around the opening to this cave cost 75 000 and there is other labor that was not tallied in put the wrought iron fence around the cave and it was built in way to keep the illegals out of the cave fortunately tile lesser long nose bats returned to the cave and they are in there now living there and reproducing but think about it for a moment if you would the effect of building a fence just around the entrance of the cave that provided a deterrent that allowed the bats to come back and live there again and reproduce and fly out and they are really essential they are essential then to the pollination of certain cactus ou there in the desert without which the cactus would not survive it has a whole set of chain reactions i am submitting that we build a fence on the border because it is a lot cheaper to do than it is to build a fence around everything that is threatened from the illegals and the drug trade that comes from our southern border that was the lesson there at the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge that being a second stop or actually a third stop along the way and then from there i went on over to organ pipe national cactus monument organ pipe is another national monument location and that is the location where the national park service officer his name was chris eggle was killed in a shootout with drug lords near the mexican border in the park property i went there with his father bob i visited the location where the shooting took place where he stood where the shooter laid where he fell where there is a monument there today that was built and placed by his father bob and his mother bonnie well they brought stones from their farm in michigan down to place around the monument and there is a cross and a picture and a place to remember where this happened where it happened that chris was killed by a drug lord or at least an employee of a drug lord who had driven across the mexican border where there was no barrier when he was being under hot pursuit by the mexican police and his vehicle broke down and collapsed and stopped across the border into the united states and chris eggle and his partner were called in on that scene as they split up and converged on the location where the drug smuggler was chris was ambushed with an ak47 that had been brought into the united states illegal of course on a vehicle that was illegal with drugs that were illegal across a border that was undefined let alone defined with a barrier e 2245 had there been a vehicle barrier there had there been a fence there chris eggle would be alive today he is not there is a memorial there at the organ pipe cactus national monument that memorializes him as well i talked to many of his coworkers that were there his spirit is alive and his spirit is strong today the happy chris eggle is the one that is remembered although he is not with us his spirit is with us and his sacrifice is something we need to remember he is not the only one he is not the first one i pray he will be the last one but i saw nothing down there that would indicate to me that he will be the last one that tragedy taught them something at organ pipe after the tragedy of chris death at the hands of the drug runner whom the mexicans were chasing into the united states and by the way that drug runner was subsequently shot and killed by the mexican police department he was in the united states and shot from their side of the border that is not an issue with me but as a matter of full disclosure i point that out the lesson learned from that was to close the border at least shut off the vehicle traffic so they have built a vehicle barrier along organ pipe and it is most of the way along the organ pipe national monument it is perhaps 32 miles altogether as i look at that and travel along the side of that border it is built so that steel posts full of concrete set in the ground and then it has got horizontal barriers about two of those one about eye height and one about halfway up designed so that vehicles cant drive through it but the desert pronghorn can run through it and jackrabbits can run through it and any kind of wildlife can go back and forth through there they had trouble with cattle moving in from mexico so they stretched a couple of barbed wires in there to keep the cattle on the mexican side of course those barbed wires were cut because the people who were jumping the border thought it was an obstruction to have to climb over one barbed wire so they cut the fence we drove through and picked a place where the illegal traffic was going across and they were demonstrating how that tracking takes place as they did with the shadow wolves on their reservation what i saw in a number of places it got to where you could pick it out easily every night traffic coming into the national monument and paths that are beaten so smooth one of the officers said well one day well shut off this illegal traffic and it will be a nice path for citizens to come down here and visit our park because it is already smoothed out it is kind of graded out by all the foot traffic in fact in one of those locations the traffic goes across the fence and right by a sign and the sign says do not enterinto the united states this is a dangerous place the sun is hot you can die in the desert there h2327 isnt water for you there are snakes there are scorpions its dangerous turn back cynically the path goes right by the sign the sign is in spanish if they can read they can read that but in a way i think it is cynically they go by that sign just to send us a message fiftyeight percent of mexicans believe they have a right to come to the united states they are utterly wrong but we need to convey that message to them so that they can understand that the united states needs to be committed to enforcing our borders the incidents that happened down there illustrate what i saw first the argument as i asked the officers retired border patrol or current officers who were at the point of retiring or quitting and giving up those were the kind of people that would talk to me they were the people that would open up to me one of them was an officer at a station no one would talk to me because the orders were you dont speak to a member of congress you dont talk to anybody from government your job is to do your job but not to tell anyone what that job is what the statistics are in your area so they sent me to an individual there who is near retirement and that individual was willing to speak in fact numbers of those individuals were willing to speak with me some ready to quit some ready to retire some retired they would talk to me straight up and open they didnt care about the consequences for that they care about this country they care about our border security and our border control and they understand that you cantbe a nation if you dont have a border you cant call it a border if you dont defend your border i hear the testimony here in congress as the border patrol testifies before the immigration subcommittee and consistently it is we stop 25 to 331 3 percent of the illegals that are traveling across our border i have used that number consistently in my remarks across this country and i ask that question of the people that are down there in the line on the line defending our national security and i would say what percentage do you stop where do you stand they would hesitate in their answer and i would say 25 to 33 percent do you stop a fourth do you stop a third how many do you stop they would laugh and give me a number one of them burst out in hysterical laughter when i submitted that they could be successful in stopping 25 percent of the illegal traffic he responded back to me no its more like 3 percent of the illegal traffic of the illegals coming into the united states do we stop and perhaps 5 percent of the illegal drugs its not 25 percent its not 33 percent in fact its not 10 percent but of the informed answers that i got down there and i asked it at every stop the informed answers that i got i never got an informed answer above 10 percent of anybody that was involved in actual protection of the border and processing people that were coming through that border ten percent now think about it for a moment 10 percent last year we apprehended about 1 188 000 illegal entrants into the united states on our southern border on that 2 000mile run 1 188 000 if that number is correct on 10 percent if you move that decimal point one over that is 11 880 000 attempts to cross the border you can take perhaps a couple of million off that if you wanted to be generous and take it down to 10 million succeeded i dont think actually 10 million succeeded coming into the united states but i do think the number is far higher than the numbers that we are working with in the media today we have used the number here 11 million illegals in america we used the number for 3 years while 4 million people a year at least were coming across the border maybe a lot more than that and over 3 years the number didnt accumulate but about 500 000 a year even less so after 3 years we finally raised the number to 12 million but no one now pays attention to that we are still back stuck in that 11 million mode of illegals in america that number is far higher than 11 million maybe we are successful in stopping 10 percent maybe the individual who advised me that 3 percent of illegals and 5 percent of the illegal drugs maybe he was off by a factor of oh lets say two maybe it is 6 percent of the illegals and 10 percent of the illegal drugs however you measure this it is astonishing in its magnitude in the cost to this country in fact we are headed down a path it wont be very much longer that everyone who wants to come to the united states will be here the message was sent january 6 2004 when our esteemed commander in chief gave a speech it is called in america the amnesty speech it was the one that said here is the pplicy that we want to have it is one of a guest worker temporary worker as the only solution if you have too many illegals in america i suppose the quickest and cheapest and the most guaranteed solution one could have is simply legalize them all give them all amnesty give them a path to citizenship voila no problem we have fixed the problem because we have legalized them all by a version of amnesty the american people reject amnesty in this country they understand that we have to have a rule of law that citizenship must be precious that you must respect the rule of law there is more to being an american than having somebody stamp automatic citizenship on your green card or on your matricular consular card there is more to being an american than that being an american is rooted in and based upon a common culture an understanding and a common sense of experience and history of reverence and respect for our borders for the sovereignty of the united states of america for the destiny of this country for the assimilation that has made us so great that have been able to take immigrants in from all over the world bring them into this great giant melting pot of america give them this opportunity and let them reach out and earn and succeed in this opportunity for success the legal immigrants in america have performed extraordinarily well in fact the vigor that they bring to our society and our economy surpasses much of the vigor that we find in the nativeborn americans that are here all of us in this congress support a rational immigration policy that is designed to enhance the economic social and cultural wellbeing of america but if we have an open borders policy and the people that advocate for an open borders policy are really advocating for an unlimited amount of immigration everyone who might want to come here to the united states could come here and if all 6 billion people on the planet want to arrive here in the same year that is fine with them they dont take a stand that there is such a thing as too much immigration even too much illegal immigration they will not stand in the way of one of them they will not stand up and say the best thing you can do for your country is to stay in your country grow its economy be part of the solution bring reform to the governments of places like mexico and points south places that are so utterly corrupt that the economy is strangled places that are so corrupt that there has to be pro tection paid at every stop along the way that you cant get a birth certification when you are born in a country unless you happen to be born into a family that has the connections and maybe is willing to pay the kind of funds to pay off the madrina network that is there so that you can get your birth certificate and somebody identify who you are and be able to move around in this society or that society the level of corruption is astonishing it runs deep i would add to this that in spite of all the statistics that i could tell you in fact i will go to some of those statistics in a moment but first i would like to recount a few incidents that really bring home the circumstances and reality as i was there on the tohono oodham reservation with the shadow wolves there was a drug smuggler who was pulled over and stopped we were out in the desert tracking some illegals and getting a feel for how that worked and excellently being guided while this was on there was a call to an emergency and a number of the shadow wolves mobilized and they called in a black hawk helicopter that was there to aerially observe a vehicle that may 9 2006 co was escaping from the ground people they followed the vehicle and got it trapped up into a deadend road and the driver took off and ran and they followed him and finally apprehended him they brought him and the pickup the small truck as i would say to some of my other friends in america into the compound there where the shadow wolves headquarters is and looked the vehicle over it looked like it had been reworked that they had taken it through a body shop and created a false floor underneath the bed of that pickup the bed itself had a plastic liner in it so you couldnt see the bodywork that had been done we looked that over and they pointed out to me how that work was done it was done in a chopshop in mexico once they got the clearance to go ahead and search the truck they went in with the jaws of life and peeled the bed of that vehicle up and apart in there we carried out 18 large bales of marijuana about 10 pounds or more per bale at least 180 pounds of marijuana lying underneath that 6 to 8inch false floor of that vehicle the alleged perpetrator and i did lay eyes on him and evaluated him i guess for my own perspective he had a 13 tattooed on his arm many other tattoos all over his chest and arms it was clear to the people there that he was ms13 mara salxatrucha 13 the most dangerous gang that we have ever seen in this continent that dangerous gang of course is smuggling drugs up into the united states they had collared one of their members one of their perpetrators who was then in that holding cell i was there to help unload the drugs from the pickup there to observe this entire process there recorded and there to burn it into my memory that we think of a large quantity of drugs where i come from it night be oh perhaps a few pounds occasionally we get larger loads coming up through iowa of course but when somebody says a lot of illegal drugs we are thinking of a quantity substantially smaller than 180 pounds they think of 180 pounds or 200 pounds of illegal marijuana as a decoy a decoy that might be designed to draw the law enforcement down another path so that when the path clears when all the law enforcement pounces on the decoy then the larger loads can come through the 1 000 pounds the 2 600pound loads the full semi loads can start up the road it is a fact that on those drug routes those highways that flow from the southern part of arizona up into the rest of the united states on those small mountains that are there there are lookouts on every strategic point those lookouts are manned by two people and they are supplied regularly and they stay on that mountain for 2week stretches at a time they are well armed they have good equipment they have night vision goggles infrared equipment for daylight they have topnotch optical equipment and they have automatic weapons of all kinds and they have good food and good support and they sit up there and they have good communications so that they can radio from mountaintop to mountaintop and be able to tell each other where our drug enforcement people where our border patrol are where the ice people are where the special agents are where the park service people are so that when the coast is clear they canrun their large load of drugs up through the corridors now this is an astonishing thing to be able to see that military positions in the united states are occupied by the drug lords and their troops and that they are well equipped and well armed and well maintained and well supplied and they are manned 24 7 by two people and we are sitting down here on the floor of this congress thinking we can get a handle on this some other way but the numbers coming across the border are astonishing and the positions that are taken on those mountaintops where the lookouts are are shocking that we would tolerate that in this country know they are there but not go up and take them out the volume of drugs again is something beyond my imagination before going down there i had never seen such a pile of illegal drugs our federal agencies report that 90 percent of the illegal drugs in the united states come across the mexican border and the value of those drugs is in the area of 60 billion a year and we sit here in the united states of america we tolerate such a thing such a thing that we would let foreign interests foreign economic interests illegal interests violate our laws and enrich themselves with the wealth of a nation and the drug addiction that is here in america of course feeds it and that is another subject for another time that is something that we need to address that is one incident the interdiction of about 180 pounds of marijuana by the shadow wolves during a later afternoon down on the tohono oodham reservation but the following evening as i was looking around i went down to a place called sasabe and that again is on the border with mexico i visited a port of entry there that is manned by the border patrol they didnt expect that i was coming i didnt call in advance i just drove down there and got out of the vehicle and began to talk to them good people they are doing their job there and they are doing it well as far as i can see as i began to have a conversation with them there was an emergency call there had been a drug deal that had gone bad on the other side of the border in the mexican community just on the south side of that port of entry usually it is a shooting but this was a knifing and the subject who was knifed had a large wound in his abdomen about 32 inches wide entered in below the ribs on the right side and up through and it did end up lacerating his liver it didnt get his lung as far as i know but the word came that the ambulance was going to cross from mexico into the united states and they prepared for that they called in a medivac from the hospital in tucson and the medivac by the time it arrived there had been two unitedstates ambulances that had arrived the mexican ambulance didnt have any oxygen didnt have bandages had only surgical gloves on it was a paramedic that was with me lent himself right to the task and began to stabilize the patient when the oxygen came they put oxygen on the patient and held him stable until they could load him onto the helicopter and airlift him out to the tucson hospital all at the cost of the american taxpayer and the cost ofthis i will get compiled over time the ambulance that came across from mexico simply parked on the united states side two ambulances came in one from near tucson one from 24 miles away one brought oxygen the other was there for support and all lent a hand to get him loaded on the helicopter and flew him up to university hospital in tucson where they do a great job and they have the only trauma center in all of southern arizona it was a real eye opener for me to see this individual who had been knifed in this fight covered with tattoos and substantially pierced and inebriated with alcohol and cocaine at his own admission as part of the contributor i think to the violence on the other side and i am advised that that kind of incident wasnt just a fluke and i kidded the border patrol officer you staged this for me of course he didnt he didnt know i was going to be there but it happens about four times a quarter in that location alone roughly 16 times a year more shootings than stabbings when we evacuate people out from mexico into united states hospitals and so i followed up yesterday and visited the hospital and visited the patient and he had been stabilized and his life had been saved without that extraordinary effort it is likely he would not have survived the next few hours but his life appears now that it has been saved and i am grateful for that but i also met wifh the hospital administrators and they are eating millions of dollars of costs in funding the people who are generally illegals in the united states they dont separate that cost from those that are evacuated from an injury or a wound that takes place on the mexican side of the border but the american taxpayers fund this the american ratepayers fund this and the hospital swallows a fair amount of it and there have been occasions where residents and american citizens of tucson arent able to be treated because all the beds are full full of people who are illegally in the united states and so that health care for the tucson residents the americans occasionally will go to phoenix and then the family members that live in the city have to drive to phoenix to visit their family and just the travel time puts their lives at risk as well thats two incidents and i did follow up on those and i will follow up on the information that comes from it i would add the third incident was i went down to the border last night down to the san miguel gate on the reservation sat in the dark for 3 hours and listened and it wasnt difficult to hear the vehicles bring the illegals down near the border drop them off and hear them talking hear them hush up and then single file go through the desert brush cross the border into the united states and be off to points unknown 4 i used to believe that it was the illegal traffic into the united states that was the biggest problem and that illegal drugs was a problem that was part of that and i am informed that when we put the barriers in there the vehicle barriers that since they cant drive across the border with illegal drugs any longer in some of the locations there are many places where they can they simply put 50 pounds of marijuana in a backpack on one young male mexican or central american generally mexicans and each one takes a backpack of 50 pounds each maybe 10 of them at a time maybe 25 at a time they have caught as many ks a hundred at a time walking each with 50 pounds and they can walk through 10 or 15 or more miles of desert on the mexico side 25 or more miles of desert on the unitedstates side and arrive up at a transportation predetermined location and then drop off their illegal drugs there and many of them turn around and walk back to mexico where they pick up another load so the illegal crossings many of those illegal crossings are people coming into the united states with illegal drugs turning back around and walking back into mexico to get another load of illegal drugs sometimes i wonder if we wouldnt be better off in this country if they would simply stay here and get a job illegal or not and i dont advocate that certainly so as i listeiied nd was there while illegals were creeping across our borer in the dead of the night not even 24 hours ago and it is another dimension entirely to see the drugs the interdiction of the drugs the violence on the border the knifing the blood the lack of health care that is there the incursions on our

shut off 90 percent of the illegal drugs that get by in the united states at least until they find another route to go around but we can build an effective barrier and as i submitted that to the people down there working on the border consistently they realize that if we build a good solid barrier one that couldnt be cut through one that couldnt be driven through one that was solid and one that would make it easy for them to drive the trail and enforce it that it could be the most effective tool that we could have it costs us 6 billion a year to incarcerate the illegals here in the united states twentyeight percent of our prison population are criminal aliens that is our city our county our state and our federal penitentiaries 28 percent criminal aliens 6 billion a year we can build one tremendous barrier with 6 billion and a onetime expenditure of course we wouldnt get it all built in 1 year so we could spread it out over 3 or 4 years and we could concentrate on the areas that needed it the most we must do that stop the bleeding stop the bleeding first shut off the leaky pipe and then we can begin to have a legitimate debate in this country on what to do about the mess it has left but i submit that we shut off the jobs magnet and we end birthright citizenship another interesting little anecdote down in that same hospital was a mexican national who was pregnant with multiple births they took care of her prenatal care out of the hospital in tucson and they also set up the provider in mexico so that they could have the equipment to arrange for and give her good care for multiple births instead she waited until she went into labor waited close to the border came into the united states went into the hospital in tucson and delivered five children there to the tune of six figures times x those children all have birthright citizenship they all have now the right and the ability to bring in by chain migration their extended family members who knows what that costs mr speaker our compassion knows no bounds i understand neither do the borders of the united states of the america apparently the united states senate needs to pass the legislation 4437 that we

perspective that he shared one of my memories that will be lodged in my heart is you encouraging all of those georgia soldiers who were so glad to see you especially those who know you from georgia politics to see a face from back home i would encourage some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who refuse to travel to visit the troops doing the work that they do so well and perhaps they would have a slightly different perspective if they spent some time with them on the ground before i yield to the gentleman from indiana i would like to take a moment and recognize some of the human side of this we had an experience in our media at one point a few months ago where one soldier had some negative things to say that ironically flew in the face of 99 percent of his comrades and created a little bit of a challenge from back home with some of the soldiers from back home and their perspective on what was being done i have a picture of two of them i would like to share i am good friends with their fathers they cast a very different perspective than what has been portrayed in some of the national media the first gentleman that i would like to point to here tonight is a great patriot he is not a political man he is a soldier he is committed to defend the constitution he is committed to honor his brothers and sisters in arms his name is art cawman and he is from boone county kentucky art is a great soldier he served as a ranger in the special forces and decided that he wanted to go to flight school he flies in the third infantry division in the third aviation brigade and he is a blackhawk pilot in operation iraqi freedom in march of 2003 he flew one of the fist blackhawks over the line for the third infantry division as they began the march to liberate iraq i had the tremendous privilege to spend some time being flown by a hometown pilot from my district whose family i jnow who shared a perspective candidly and openly about the sober nature of this struggle art cawman is the kind of soldier whose face we need to have on this war art cawman is the kind of soldier who went out and made a difference art cawman is somebody who adapted to the changes in circumstances who understands the nature of this mission who understands that islamic extremism is a threat to every person in the world regardless of faith or ethnicity or nationality he is willing to serve he has had comrades that he has lost in this struggle but he understands the nature of it he does not do it he does not do it in a somber way but with a commitment and understanding and excitement of being part of a great unit a great heritage a great tradition and frankly a great country that values freedom one of my personal pleasures was being able to bring a taste of home to him and also to a soldier i will show my colleagues in just a moment but we have a tradition back in the fourth district of kentucky called skyline chili or cincinnati chili that is a unique regional taste like many parts of the country have my airfare for being flown by him and his fine crew that day on our flight of two and also including the other aircraft was a case of this chili we wanted to pass that on to them just a small way to say thank you what i was most impressed with art was his clear understanding of the nature of the mission his clear understanding of the nature of the struggle and a clear understanding that all it takes to win is to continue the mission i heard from this young warrant officer the same perspective that this insurgency though a threat to individuals is strategically irrelevant these elections are going to happen this government is going to stand it is going to be different than what we have here in the united states but their work is bringing results it is also bringing quality of life to people who have never known freedom they have never known government as a friend they have never known that the police are not your enemy but they are there to protect you he is setting that example a high standard of american values he represents a great unit with a great tradition and a great chain of command there is another gentleman i would like to share with my colleagues as well this young captain standing next to me on forward operating base sharana i referenced our visit to sharana before this is as we came off the helicopters after flying 150 miles south of kabul this is captain joe geraci he is the class of 1997 from the united states military academy at west point his father joe geraci sr is an active member of our business community that i have known well for years he has made a great contribution to our local community and his son is making a great contribution to our nation he is leading a tremendous operation in southeastern afghanistan right now that is driving the taliban out of eastern paktika province in colonel tim mcguires 1st of the 508th we also brought the taste of home to him you can see it obscured behind the photograph there but we brought that case of chili and he sent me an email the other night as he was eating it with his troops and said the only thing that was missing was a vanilla coke to make the taste of home complete they understand the seriousness of their business joe has a 5yearold son whose birthday he missed he has a wife and parents who are worrying about him every day but as we all talked on the phone the other day the one thing they understand is that captain joe geraci who is a professional infantry officer who is walking in the finest heritage and traditions of every generation that has come before us as our young soldiers sailors airmen and marines are he is doing a tremendous job in winning a fight over there that is every bit as critical as the greatest generations fight in the second world war it is every bit as critical to our national security now i would like to yield the floor for a few minutes to another of my colleagues the gentleman from indiana who joined me in the journey to congress some 4 years ago the gentleman from indiana was a former noncommissioned officer in the indiana national guard who had a great opportunity to go in

american people understand what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a

and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these people are goingto qualify for assistance i yield

floor so if you feel you want to move in on something go ahead and i will let you interrupt and you can let me interrupt and we will go like that lets talk about tax policy in the united states congress since i have been here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"],

believe that we are showing our commitment we are 131 million this year above the amount requested by the president we are 502 million above the amount that was appropriated ifi 2005 that is just in our particular appropriation bill so i do share the gentlewomans concerns about this and i believe however that we are moving very strongly in that direction and perhaps the gentlewoman from new york would like to add something"], [0.0005709528923034668, 0.49942904710769653, 0, "i have no other speakers at this time i reserve the balance of my time 0 1445"], [0.0009434819221496582,

talk about who won and who lost let us talk about who did win it was not special interests it was those who qualify under the family olportubityact who for the first time for families with disabled children who may be up to 300 percent of poverty will now be able to receive services that will be 115 000 children who are disabled that will gain medicaid coverage by 2015 according to cbo the home and community based services the estimate is that another 120 000 enrollees will be able to take advantage of this getting services in their own home or in their community rather than having to go to a nursing home with the program that is included of money following the person instead of people having to go into a nursing home again they will be able to have services in their own home and it is estimated that another 100 600 people are going to qualify for that over the next 8 to 9year period so those are some of the people who are certainly going to be benefited now let us talk about the program overall medicaid is a program that is out of control even with the reforms of slowing it down by threetenths of 1 percent over the next 5 years it is still going to grow at an estimated 7 percent growth rate and over the next 10 years we are going to be spending in state and federal money 5 2 trillion let us talk about some of the claims that have been made during the time we have been in recess that are without substance and fact one is with regard to copays the governors told us they wanted to be able to put some personal responsibility back into the prokram and that copays were one way to do it but we wanted to make sure that we did not hurt the most vulnerable as a result there are no enforceable copays to be charged to beneficiaries and families with incomes below the federal poverty level in addition copays cannot be charged to a select group of individuals in these big categories mandatory children individ uals receiving adoption and foster care assistance preventive care and immunizations pregnancyrelated services hospice residents institutional spenddown populations emergency services family planning services women who qualify for medicaid under the breast and cervical cancer eligibility also one of the claims is that we would do away with the early screening of children it is specifically included in the plan that these children must be included in the socalled espdt program regardless of whether the state elects to provide services in an optional format or otherwise one of the other areas is with regard to the reforms we have made in asset transfers the socalled millionaires on medicaid yes we have tightened the rules as we should do but we have specifically made sure that anyone who is in a legitimate hardship area will have an exclusion and states are required to provide a review process to make sure that that happens so we believe overall that the reforms are needed there are the kinds of refornis that the governors have asked us to make so that we can keep the program solvent otherwise as the governors national representatives on a unanimous basis told us in the committee if we do not medicaid over the long haul will be unsustainable so therefore i urge you to adopt the provisions that are included in this bill"], [0.0012193918228149414, 0.5012193918228149, 0, "i make a point of order against the motion because it

side of the aisle president bush said most scientists believe that research on embryonic stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body i hear my friends on the other side of the aisle argue that we really only need cordblood stem cell research that that will lead us to all that we need f 1330 and the president said about thiat that no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent and he said embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body i then hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about research that this is going to lead to so much more research yet at the same time we have seen no increase flatlined spending budgeting on the national institutes of health something that many of us the gentlewoman from colorado and many of the rest of us have though we should increase spending on medical research all across the board in all kinds of medical research yes in order to make room for the presidents tax cuts that have gone overwhelmingly to the wealthiest in our country we have simply cut medical research and not done what we should as a nation do ovbrall in medical research so when i hear my friends talk on this i do not quite get how this will expand medical research while closing out one whole avenue of medical research and at the same time cutting spending on what we should be doing to move our country ahead"]]}
