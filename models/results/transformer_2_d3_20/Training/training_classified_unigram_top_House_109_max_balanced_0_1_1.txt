unsustainable and automatic growth of mandatory spending programs and extending tax relief to families and small businesses we have successfully accomplished the first two now this rule will provide for consideration of our final commitment to american taxpayers extending numerous important tax relief provisions in 2001 2003 and 2004 congress enacted responsible tax relief to help create new jobs grow americas economy and put more money in the hands of workers families small businesses farms and ranches following this tax relief unemployment dropped a full percentage point to 5 percent and we have experienced 10 uninterrupted quarters of real growth in our economy above 3 percent the longest stretch since the 1980s as was proven by the tax cuts during the kennedy and reagan administrations federal revenues actually increase after taxes are lowered our expanding economy is led by consumer spending job growth and business investment this is a result of allowing workers to keep more of their hardearned money decreasing the tax burden on small businesses so they can expand and hire more workers and providing incentives for families to save and invest unless we take action today many of the important tax provisions that have helped our economy grow strong will expire without passage of this legislation workers families and small businesses will have less of their paycheck to take home each week h r 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act not the most eloquent of names but an important one will continue to build on the economic progress we have already made a key part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 was a return to fairness for those who live work and raise families in states with no state income tax the state and local sales tax deduction is particularly important to those in my home state of florida and nine other states because it gives every taxpayer the opportunity to deduct state sales tax from his federal tax bill something that other highertax states have enjoyed for some time this provision is set to expire in 3 weeks while i will continue to work to make the state and local sales tax deduction permanent this bill extends the provision for an additional year which is an important step forward for fairness the bill also extends several tax incentives to enhance the affordability of higher education including taxdeferred education savings accounts and tax credits for postsecondary education it allows all taxpayers to deduct up to 4 000 of higher education expenses which will help more students go to college for teachers the tax bill extends an important abovetheline deduction to help them contain the costs of outofpocket classroom expenses such as books supplies and computer equipment we all know that our hardworking educators are covering for some of our neediest students and this bill lets them keep the tax deductibility of their generosity in an effort to encourage savings and stable retirement security this tax bill allows lowerincome families that contribute to individual retirement accounts and pension plans to continue receiving a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first 2 000 of annual contributions this encourages families to save and plan for their own retirement while we were unable as a body to settle on a social security reform plan surely we can all agree that encouraging lowincome families to save for retirement and giving them the tools to do so is a sound economic policy our bill freezes the rate on capital gains and dividends and prevents an increase of the tax burden on 24 million families it is imperative that we extend this tax relief so our economy will continue on its upward track new data released at the start of december show that our economy continues to strengthen and grow the labor department reported that employers added 215 000 jobs in november after adding 44 000 in october and 17 000 in september in the wake of devastating hurricanes the jobless rate remains unchanged at 5 percent the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 3 percent in the third quarter much stronger than expected forecasters outlooks for coming months are upbeat as well novembers increase in payroll the largest since july was broadbased construction employment rose by 37 000 employment in professional and technical services rose by 22 000 health care employment rose by 20 000 jobs manufacturers added 11 000 jobs last month following an increase of 15 000 in october the most recent commerce department report shows overall consumer spending increased at a 4 2 percent annual rate exceeding expectations purchases of nondurable goods surged 3 6 percent exceeding expectations housing spending came in at 8 4 percent business investment spending rose at 8 8 percent exceeding expectations obviously the current tax policy of this congress has encouraged economic growth and to raise taxes now would close the door of opportunity that is open for so many today this rule provides for consideration of a substitute bill while we often hear democrats decry tax relief they have decided to offer a substitute that extends many of the same tax provisions as this underlying bill does but let us look at who they left out the democratic substitute does not extend an income tax credit for lowincome families who contribute toindividual retirement accounts iras and pension plans this hurts lowincome families who are struggling to save for retirement people who are doing the right things to prepare for their future rather than solely depending on the government to do it for them the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes on small businesses the very engines of innovation and growth and employment in this country the democratic substitute does not include an extension of the reduced rates on capital gains and dividends without this extension 24 million families will see a tax increase including 7 million seniors who have benefited an average of 1 200 annually from that change at a time when concern is growing about foreign investment in the united states the democratic substitute throws up barriers to americans investing in america the democratic substitute does include a tax increase on families and small businesses to pay for the bill many of these individuals are small businesses who do much of the hiring and buying in this economy the democratic substitute bill leaves behind small businesses omits lowincome savers and hurts families and seniors at a time when home heating bills are rising and local property taxes are growing why would the democratic substitute take even more from the wallets and purses and piggy banks of the american taxpayer the republican tax reforms of 2001 2003 and 2004 have created jobs strengthened our economy and increased federal revenues in the process they quantifiably aided in shortening and curtailing the severity of the recession of 2000 and 2001 they buoyed the economy through major terrorist attacks devastating natural disasters and a global war on terrorism now is not the time to increase taxes on the ameriqan people failure to pass this bill would result in higher taxes on seniors savers small businesses and farmers we must continue the policies that grow our economy and keep our tax bills

imperative that we begin our discussionat the beginning and that beginning wasnt on 911 weve been under attack for at least 30 years we did not want this fightwe did not invite this fightwe did not wish to engage in this battle however once our enemy crossed over the line confirmed for us and the worldthat they were unwilling to respect international law respect individual liberty respect sovereignty of nationsand that they were willing and desirous of engaging in mortal battleno other option was left to us or the civilized world abu musab alzarqawi on january 23 2005 said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology so this discussion today comes down to a fundamental questionwhat is the appropriate strategy and tactic to adopt to win the war on terror will we withdraw and simply defenda policy of isolation and containment or will we aggressively combat terrorismand take the battle to our enemy this war is unlike any other in historywithout a doubt our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around the world the only unifying element is hatehate for the westhate for democracyhate for freedom of religionhate for liberty the only message our enemy understands is force period terrorists dont negotiateterrorists dont compromiseterrorists are not interested in peace to them thats weakness thankfully weve stayed the course thankfully weve persevered in both iraq and afghanistan the greatest threat to terrorism is freedom liberty and democracy in the middle east and beyond today the terrorists are truly on the run last week unitedstates and iraqi forces eliminated a qaeda in iraqs top terroristabu musab al zarqawi this was accomplished with excellent intelligenceknowing where the bad guys were and when and this information came from iraqi civiliansthat is a very positive sign this important step demonstrates many things we will hunt down terrorists and eliminate them wherever they are hiding the shackles of decades long terrorism are being removed from the middle east iraqi security forces are stepping up to the challenge iraqi citizens want to be free of terrorists and they are not going to sit idly by success breeds success never has that been more evident than this past week while zarqawi was eliminatedfinding him brought a treasure trove of information allowing unitedstates and iraqi forces to dismantle many more pieces of al qaedas puzzle success breeds success iraq just this past week selected 3 more officialscabinet ministersto serve in its standing government success breeds success it is also important for us to recall and reiterate why we are engaged in this war it is imperative during this debate that we reexamine the conditions that required the united states to take military action in afghan istan and iraq in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 2001 just a short look at

a reminder of the dangers we face as a nation in a post9 11 world we can no longer expect oceans between us and our enemies to keep us safe policy of containment has been proven to be a dismal failure just as the battle in afghanistan was not simply to remove the taliban the battle in iraq was not simply to remove saddam hussein and his murderous regime one has to look no further than the action of our enemy to see that we are fighting those who want to bring their brand of terror and fear to our shores we must not forget those threats that have been disrupted here at home and on our allies the west coast airliner plot the heathrow airport plot and the jose padilla plot the campaign against the united states and its allies is ambitious simple and clear terrorists will stop at nothing to achieve their distorted sense of reality now we could have easily stayed out of this conflict however giving terrorists free reign would not make us any saferhistory has proven that the price would be more innocent lives lostmore bombingsand not an ounce of peace we must not be held hostage by terrorismthat is not living in liberty and freedom there are defining moments every generation must face

such a wide variety of experience from our members that bring that experience to bear here as we look at how we grow the economy how we exercise economic opportunity how we make certain that free enterprise stays free just as the gentleman from georgia has mentioned it is no secret everybody knows that this economy this wonderful unitedstates economy truly is our nations our worlds economic engine it is the envy of all of the world it is i guess something that is really a little bit uniquely american there is something about us we strive to do things a little bit better maybe it is that yankee ingenuity maybe it is that we are out here with that good old commonsense knowhow but we are always trying to do things faster better more efficiently more effectively and one of the things we certainly want to do is to build a strong economy so that our children know that they are going to have hope and opportunity and the ability to dream big dreams and create a really exciting life for themselves and for their families i guess that is just kind of the american way of doing things we try to improve it give us something and we are going to build a better mousetrap then we are going to figure out how to get that mousetrap into the marketplace in todays economy we look at it and we say how do we get that into a global marketplace we know in order to do that it means you have to stay competitive we know that as you look at policies creating the right environment so that job growth can take place so that economic growth can take place that when we see that right environment created then free enterprise and the private sector take over and they do what they do well the gentleman has shown us the charts which tell this story you go back and you look at 2003 and look at when those tax reforms were implemented and what we saw was an economy that took off what we are seeing is consistent economic growth every single month we are reaping the benefits from that we see that our gdp growth continues to be very consistent it was 4 1 percent last quarter there are some really wonderful benefits that come from this as the gentleman mentioned 4 460 000 new jobs those are new jobs many of those jobs are jobs that are basically in new sectors technology sectors sectors of the economy that will lead to an economic renaissance and lead to an economic renaissance in this country it works out to be 194 000 jobs a month that we have been creating over the past several months and i find it so interesting that the unemployment rate is near alltime lows when we look at the charts on that we see that as these tax reforms have been put in place and i applaud the senate i applaud the administration and i certainly applaud the leadership in this house for pushing forward these tax reforms in 2003 and as we see those going into place and we see the gdp growth and we see the jobs creation and we watch the unemployment level fall to near historic lows there is also afother benefit from this our colleagues who are joining us here on the floor this evening certainly are watching this one with us and it is that we are seeing the deficit reduced through two ways we have talked so many times on this floor about there being two ways that we work through reducing the deficit and reducing the size of government and rightsizing the federal government and that is we reduce spending and continue to work to root out waste fraud and abuse focusing on that spending column but at the same time we put the focus on economic growth that is where our focus rightfully should be this is an aggressive economy and it is therefore a reason and tomorrow this house is going to move forward and take some excellent steps to pass a bill that is going to continue these tax reforms at this time i am going to yield back to the gentleman from georgia so that he can yield to another of our colleagues and we can continue with our discussion this evening on the benefits that lie ahead by extending these tax reforms and continuing to work toward having a federal income tax system that is flatter that is fairer that is simpler and having one that is going to work to energize our economy i will

issues that are important to the american people i am going to be heading to my district for the weekend as most members are spending some time there having the opportunity to talk with them but as the gentleman from georgia was saying we wanted the opportunity to just address and maybe do a little bit of correcting on some of the points that our colleagues from across the aisle have been saying and stating sometimes i think that they are just sadly misinformed on some of these issues they saidthat republicans are not looking to cut spending i just find that extraordinary they said that democrats are the ones that are wanting to cut spending the level of hypocrisy in that statement is absolutely astounding we have a democratic party in this house whose message and i honestly believe many days is the only message that they have that message is spend more whatever it is spend more whatever they are wanting to do if they do not think the outcome is right go spend more and for years they have held this thought that if you just put more money in the pot then the outcome is going to be what they want spend more spend more and what holds them together i think that is something that is a curiosity to many people because they are not united on foreign policy they are not united on winning in iraq they are not united on border control issues they are not united behind working families who tell us repeatedly that what they want is lower taxes lighter regulation preserving individual freedom and having their shot at hope and opportunity our colleagues across the aisle are not united on that the one thing that they repeatedly seem to be united on is spending more of the taxpayers money spending more of your hardearned money and it is amazing to me government never gets enough of the taxpayer money government has this huge voracious appetite for the taxpayers money they just cannot get enough of it there is always another program many of them are great programs but one of the truths that we all see here in this body if government moves in to solve a problem generally neither the private nor notforprofit sector will move in and address that problem 1415 so you have additional costs that come about every time we talk about winning in iraq our friends across the aisle seem to say let us get out regardless of the sacrifices that are made every time we talk about controlling the border they are over there saying no way yesterday i was on a cnbc program and a democrat member of the house said that their party had never been invited to offer spending cuts there are 435 members of this body and they are waiting for an invitation to come in and participate in how to reduce the size of government this morning i was on the floor and i said please consider this the invitation come on everybody needs to work on this it should be a bipartisan effort it should involve every single member of this house how we go about reducing what the federal government spends i have three bills that would enact acrosstheboard cuts 1 percent 2 percent and 5 percent cuts and for all of their talk today about how they want to cut spending not one single democrat is on those bills not one we have got 14 republicans who are on those bills and not one democrat has signed on to commit to finding 1 2 or 5 percent of waste fraud and abuse in government spending i ask my colleagues who is really leading on this issue i hear plenty of accusations from the left i hear plenty of complaining and i see zero action a lot of talk no action they controlled this body for 40 years and in that 40 years they built layer after layer after layer after layer of government they cooked them a big old government cake layer upon layer we have got programs out there that do nothing but waste our money we have got 342 different economic development programs there is a lot of work that we can do everyone is invited to come in and work on these issues and anytime we even try to restrain spending look at the rhetoric that we hear it is our party in this house it is our leader the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert who truly is leading on this issue not the minority leader it is our leaders who are pushing this it is our party who would like to reduce government spending by billions of ddllars billions more in next years budget it is our party that would like to see acrosstheboard spending reductions their solution that they offer is repealingtax relief that is well deserved by hardworking american families repealing that reliefand raising taxes period that

did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this

accountable growth and i would point out this that growth that we have in our economy is growing in spite of the fact that 3 5 percent perhaps of our gdp is going off the top to the litigation that

help us develop our infrastructure in this country to accommodate the future as our infrastructure depreciates that is what it is going to take to grow and what it is going to take to balance the

goes on year after year that is growing at a rate of about 6 2 percent a year and that is aggregate and that is social security medicare and medicaid those three entitlements are essentially unless we change some of the larameters are the right now the un touchable budget items and eventually this congress will have to look at them but those three entitlements will grow at about 6 2 percent of

discretionary spending we will call that other to balance the budget we would need to simply cut the nondefense discretionary spending by 5 percent areal 5 percent cut and that would be 0 95 on the dollar that would be asking americans to get along with 0 95 out of every dollar that they have right now today not grow in relation to inflation and not grow with any kind of a cola now if i were looking at this from a business perspective i would advocate that we just simply balance our budget in that fashion but i am also aware that the votes on the floor of this congress will rot accommodate for that so i will be seeking to put together a budget that looks at some of the other components and gets us to the point where we can reasonably practically and in fact part of the equation here is politically balance this budget it cannot and should not be done by simply raising taxes by doing so it would stifle growth and it would get a reverse effect beyond in the opposite direction that my colleagues who just got finished speaking would say i am just going to go backwards through some of the remarks that i heard made over this past hour and address some of them i certainly cannot address them all but the argument that all of the money that was spent all this is a quote all that money is wasted meaning the money that was spent for reconstruction in iraq all wasted with no oversight no oversight mr speaker i take exception to a statement such as that i went over to iraq with three of my colleagues last august and returned here about august 20 with the very mission in mind to take a look at where the 18 5 billion that we allocated out of this congress had been spent where the practices were where the projects were how the money was being spent and what was the return on that investment and i brought a chart along with me coincidentally not knowing that would be the subject matter that was brought up here on the other side of the aisle this evening a chart that illustrates where these project dollars have gone i would point out that these red dots on this map of iraq represent 2 200 more than 2 200 completed projects in iraq and these projects will be road projects they will be sewer projects water drinking water potable water projects they will also be some bridge projects and some pipeline work for the oil pipe lines that are there you will see along on this border with iran the red dots along there many of those are border defense stations and what you will not see are the 250 planned border defense stations that are under construction or in planning around these othei borders that we have there is another 1 100 projects that are either in planning or under construction that do not show up yet on this chart i will have a chart that reflects the projects that are planned the projects that are started then this one reflects just the projects that are completed over 2 200 and i visited a number of these of course it would not be possible to visit them in their entirety but i stopped up here in this region around kirkuk and there went to the mother of all generators i forget just how many kilowatts that generator does put out but i remember what it weighed 750 000 pounds brought in on two large loads and then the other loads would be the rest of the generating plant across about 10 7 kilometers excuse me it was more than that it was a long stretch at least across the northern part of iraq with that kind of a long trail ofa convoy to deliver the generator and the turbine that drives that generator down to this location just south of kirkuk and that being one of two huge generation plants that are now in a position where they are up and running in iraq this one is fed by a natural gas pipeline some of them are using different types of fuel but up in this area around kirkuk there is so much oil that it actually seeps to the top of the ground in some places where i come from the area we call it the prairie pothole region where we have these potholes of water that are collected because of the dips that are cut out in the prairie from the last glacier well the water that collects there reminds me of the oil and certainly the oil is in smaller quantities that collects in the depressiois within the desert up there around kirkuk i and that is not the largest oil location up around kirkuk but down here in the southern part in the basra region there is far more oil and i look at the system of collection the well system the collection system the refinery system distribution system all of it is old tired dilapidated has not been reconstructed or modernized in at least 35 years and yet the oil production out of iraq is greater than it was we keep hearing no they are not producing as much oil now as they were then not true the royalties that iraq was receiving prior to the war were 5 billion a year the royaltiesthat are coming from the oil that is pumping today are 26 billion a year that does not necessarily reflect that they are pumping five times as much oil but it reflects that they are selling perhaps more oil than they did then and pumping more oil than they did the electricity that is being generated in iraq is anumber that is close to twice as much electricity at their peak days as it was on a standard day in iraq at the beginning of the liberation back in march of 2003 and as i measure project after project benefit after benefit it cannot be said that and i will quote again all that money is wasted how could all that money be wasted when we have 2 200 completed projects 3 300 projects altogether people that have potable water that never had it before people that have flush toilets that did not flush before they did not have water to flush in them looking at the infrastructure that is there in places in baghdad where they had the sanitary sewer and i would point out for the lay person listening that a sanitary sewer is not really all that sanitary that is what you run your sewage through and yet that sewer was an easy place for some people to pull a waterline through in those days before the ltberation of baghdad so their drinking water in many areas was delivered through a black piece of plastic pipe that was pulled through the sewer itself and they would pull it through and then the distribution runs out to the locations where it was being used and that is all fine as long as you keep your waterline in condition and it does not ever get a leak in it and you do not ever let the pressure go down but both of those things invariably happen and when that happens the pressure goes down in your drinking waterline and the sewage then is drawn into that drinking waterline and it then pollutes the drinking water that has happened in a number of areas in baghdad we are reconstructing that we are providing them with clean new sanitary sewer systems and sewer plants to be able to handle their systems in a modern fashion and an environmentally friendly fashion so the iraqi people that were living without services now have services i will say that the electrical service that was up to 10 11 perhaps even 12 hours a day in baghdad at the beginning of the liberation is down to less than that now perhaps even as low as 4 to 6 hours a day but the rest of iraq was getting 2 to 4 hours a day and now they are up to 10 11 12 hours of electricity a day the next wave is to increase the generation capacity and the distribution so that baghdad can get back up again to a level that they were before but overall there is more electricity being provided into iraq today than there ever was the demand is perhaps twice as great as it was because you know what happens when people get electricity they figure out a way that they can put another appliance to work and plug it into a wall and use it like air conditioners that did not exist in any significant numbers now they are there in significant numbers tapped into that electricity we also know that satellite televisions were against the law in march of 2003 and today iraq is replete with satellite dishes onrooftop after rooftop in fact i did a survey from the air by helicopter over the top of a region up in kirkuk where many homes were built in about the same style and i had done so over the rooftops of mosul in the fall of 2003 and there my survey showed that about twothirds of the homes then already had satellite tvs and now iam seeing that in some of the neighborhoods in kirkuk there actually are more satellite dishes than there are roofs so you will see sometimes two or even three satellite dishes on a single roof that look like they are singlefamily dwellings from the air everyone in iraq has access to satellite tv which means access to the outside world there is access to internet cell phones those things have grown dramatically landline telephones have grown dramatically the number of newspapers are up to over 175 newspapers in iraq television stations up and running communication is flowing free enterprise is robust in the streets of baghdad people that are running shops out there making furniture out alongside the streets set it out on the side of the street and sell it and yes a bomb goes off once in a while and it is sad and it is tragic but the people of iraq clean things up and they grieve and they go back to work because they are optimistic about the future of iraq they are more optimistic about the future of iraq than the surveys show people are in the united states of america what went wrong her6 where people that we say do not have hope have more hope than those of us folks that have the great blessing of living in the united states of america with all of this hope that we take for granted and cannot apparently appreciate so the effort that has been put forth there it is not all that money that is being wasted not by a long shot mr speaker 3 300 projects all of them worthy and worthwhile and no they were not all cheap there was money that was spent for security and there were some projects that were sabotaged that had to be reconstructed again there is a project over here on the tigris river south of kirkuk where there were nine pipelines that went across the tigris river and those pipelines were cut in the liberation operations with the unitedstates air force and we went back to patch those pipelines together did so they were sabotaged again they were put across the river on a bridge and so we undertook the effort to put them all underneath the bottom of the tigris river they are backfilling that now and it is nearly completed and those lines will be opened up and running by i believe the target date is february 28 so another big day to turn those valves on and get that oil flowing south into parts where it can be converted back to cash and be able to help the funding in the great country of iraq this emerging free arab country that has now at least brought forth the name of a prime minister and i do not think formally has elected him yet but on that day that that happens and they seek this duly elected parliament iraq becomes the most representative arab nation in the world when they sit down at the united nations and their representative speaks on behalf of the iraqi people it will truly be a voice of the iraqi people quite unlike the voice of much of the rest of the arab world where the voicethat speaks for the countries that represent those parts of the arab world in the united nations often is the voice of a tyrant that would cut the tongues out of its oin citizens if they spoke up in criticism of the regime that is there in many of those countries but this country can become the lodestar of a free arab people an inspiration to the rest of the arab world an that is a chilling concept but it also inspiration that can cause the rest of should tell us that there is no negothem to see what iraq is stepping into tiated settlement we must defend ourwhat they are earning along with the selves the israelis have had to guard coalition forces efforts and sacrifice to every theater every bus stop every be able to be that inspiration for the hospital every school every synarest of the arab world and if that day gogue and still the infiltrators come in comes and i pray it comes mr speak and detonate their bombs and blow er we may well see freedom echo their women and children to pieces across the arab world in the same fash that happens out of a deep hatred ion that it echoed across eastern eu that we dont understand in this counrope when the wall went down in ber try and i dont claim to understand it lin november 9 1989 on that glorious but i know that hatred is directed at day that symbolized the end of the us we saw it september 11 we saw it cold war a victory for the united on 18 to 20 other attacks including the states and the forces of freedom uss cole we saw it in the unitedstates emand the forces of freedom could not bassy bombings in africa we have seen be stopped almost the first attack also on the twin towbloodlessly they echoed across eastern ers in other efforts shut off by good ineurope and we saw country after coun telligence work in this country try be liberated we cannot rest our choices though are guard every theater every bus 0 2320 stop every school every hospital since that time we have noticed every church every synagogue and pull that those who knew freeddm the least back into the shores of the united hungered for it the most the people on states and somehow think that we can the east side of the wall stepped up to protect every center in this country help all of our efforts our coalition and we wont be able to and we will see forces in iraq in greater numbers than the attacks come and we will see our the people on the west side of the wall women and children and our men blown the people on the west side of the into pieces wall had the privilege of living with or we can take this battle to them freedom since the end of world war 11 we can fight this war where they are the people on the east side of the wall but going out just to kill the enemy remember the days they werent free mr speaker isnt enough it is not a they remember the day of november 9 solution it is something that has to be 1989 when they had that opportunity done in certain areas of the world and to grasp their own freedom and within under those circumstances where there a couple of years that freedom did echo are training camps and active leaders across eastern europe and it needs to that are plotting and planning to atecho across the arab world tack and kill americans that must be so i submit that there done is a vision and mission in this overall but to go out and think that we war on terror and we need to do a far could kill all of our enemies is the better job of articulating why we are in equivalent of realizing that we had a this war i would point out that the lot of flies on our porch and in our loss of americans on september 11 was kitchen and then go out to the barn right at 3 000 americans that is more with the fly swatter and think we are americans lost there than was lost de going to take care of all those flies in cember 7 1941 in that day that would the barn with the fly swatter no you live in infamy can swat flies in the barn all day every we cannot forget september 11 we day and you will never accomplish the cannot forget that we were attacked task you have got to change the habiwithout cause we didnt provoke any tat that breeds that many flies you one who attacked us they attacked us have to clean the barn because they hate our way of life they and you need to leave an environment attacked the very center of western in there that doesnt breed those flies civilization and then they will leave you alone on and no amount of negotiation un the porch and in your kitchen as well derstanding no amount of sitting so i submit that the plan of the around and talking is ever going to re united states and the mission that has solve this disagreement these people been laid out by our commanderinwant us dead they have demonstrated chief president bush is to create a new that and we saw the celebrations in habitat to promote a new habitat in the streets in other parts of the world the region this is a habitat called as the twin towers fell that should freedom we happen to know that tell us that they will give us no quar where there is freedom there isnt a ter habitat that breeds terrorists we have if anyone doubts that take a look at never gone to war against another free israel take a look and see the cir people it has never happened in the cumstanoes there when the israelis history of this country and i dont thought they could trade land for think it has actually happened in the peace and yet they are still attacked history of the world hamas won the election there that so to the extent that freedom can be means the terrorists the people who promoted and we give people that opare sworn to annihilate the land of portunity to reach out and grasp and israel are running the government of earn their own freedom is also the exthe region that may or may not be a tent to which we can be safer as a peonation called palestine ple western civilization can be safer and the people in that part of the world can learn some tolerance for christianity for judaism for capitalism for free enterprise for this whole idea of western civilization that they seem to take such exception to there are good people in that part of the world and those good people need to be empowered and we need to be supportive bf them the allegations that were made here on the other side of the aisle about corruption in iraq with millions of unitedstates dollars we dont know that and i wont tell you that you can go into an environment with a 18 5 billion mission and spend every dollar that would be competitive with a project in the united states because i know that some of that money had to go for security and some of that money had to go for a high price to get the work done because who would go into that environment and do that work but that work was necessary and to the extent that anyone hag defrauded this government yes we need to search that out we need to have oversight but democrats in this congress are not absolved from that responsibility i did not hear a single solution come out here on the other side of the aisle not one all i saw was complaints lamentations objections because all things that go wrong are all republican responsibility according to the other side of the aisle and of course if they were just in power then everything would be all fine but we dont know what they would do because they havent proposed a solution not a single specific solution they are absolutely without an agenda but they have enough energy they have enough air velocity in their lungs to every night come down here and beat

majority in charge in this congress we do have our work to do i wont shirk that responsibility i step up to it gladly but we need to have our eyes wide open we need to promote a responsible budget and i will be promoting a balanced budget and a path we can get to a balanced budget in a way that we can get the votes in this congress to get it done if we do that we can ensure financial security for our children and our grandchildren but that financial security that can come with fiscal responsibility here in this congress and a solid progrowth tax policy isnt security if we have to be

write to urge you to oppose h r 5092 the socalled atf modernization and reform act far from modernizing atf this legislation would severely undermine the bureau and protect corrupt gun dealers and gun

on to specifically point out that the requirement that the atf prove that a gun trafficker or corrupt gun dealer not only broke the law only specifically intended to break the law would make it virtually impossible for atf to successfully enforce our nations gun laws that is signed by a number of former members of the atf including two of the former directors of atf let me also quote from david dibetta who is an 18year veteran of the atf and who is president of the federal law enforcement officers associations atf division he said it very simply it could be crippling look people have said when various members of congress have proposed new gun safety laws they have said just enforce the laws on the books and we need to enforce the laws on the books so what is especially troubling is that we are here today not to increase enforcement of the laws on the books but to weaken the ability of federal law enforcement officers to go after the worst offenders i find it somewhat puzzling that we are gathered here in what has been dubbed by some socalled security september to consider a bill that ties the hands of federal law enforcement officers and gives a break to those few bad apples among the gun dealers who sell mostly to the criminal market that is what is especially puzzling according to the atf itself nearly 60 percent of the guns that are sold to the criminal market are sold by just 1 percent of the gun dealers the vast majority of people who are selling guns in this country are honest lawabiding citizens but this bill isnt designed to help them this bill will help those who are the worst violators in a little bit i am going to go into how this impacts my state of maryland where the atf has been trying to revoke the license of one of the worst violators but
