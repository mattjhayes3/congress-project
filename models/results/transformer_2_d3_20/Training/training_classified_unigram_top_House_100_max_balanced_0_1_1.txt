this house defeated the administrations request for military aid to the contres that day today the choice before us is more difficult we must decide whether to support a modified humanitarian aid package to aid the victims of war or set a strategy that will result in approving the administrations military aid package the choice today is military aid or humanitarian aid by the nature of that choice it forces approval of an aid package that hopefully begins to heal the terrible wounds of war and moves our government a small step forward toward facilitating peace in central america the key to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in central america has and will be adherence to the guatemala peace process led by costa rican president oscar arias the basis of our policy in that region must be to work with and respect the other nations of central america to obtain a diplomatic solution through the peace effort underway they requested that we stop military aid we showed respect for the peace process and people of central america when we defeated a request for military assistance 1 month ago and the house must continue in that path for peace by defeating any and all military aid requests so that the peace process can continue toward a permanent ceasefire and a return to regional stability the time has come to undo the destruction of life fostered over the past 7 years to the tune of 1 billion now is the time for the american people to regain control of our options in nicaragua now is the time to pressure the administration to hold bilateral and multilateral talks with nicaragua and now is the time to turn our resources in the region from supplying weapons of war to building instruments of peace the bitter choice is that in order to prevent the passage of military assistance to the contras we must provide some modified humanitarian aid to victims of the war in nicaragua and the contras we nrc have a congressional majority and majority of americans working fervently toward peace we have a strong coalition in the house committed to rejecting lethal and nonlethal military aid we must retain that coalition the democratic aid package is not perfect qnd it does not take the preferred step which would be an end to all forms of aid to the contras however this package does make some important strides toward encouraging compliance with the central american peace plan as well as a necessary step toward an orderly and humane withdrawal of united states military aid to the contras for the first time since 1979 a truly humanitarian aid package will be sent to the people of nicaragua president arias is on record stating that this package is not inconsistent with the spirit and letter to the peace accord this package sets an essential precedent by designating half of the 30 million for the children victims of war over 10 000 orphans and thousands of youthful casualties have been caused from land mines attacks on civilian villages and targeting of health clinics in nicaragua this 14 6 million childrens survival assistance will be distributed by the agency for international development to private voluntary organizations like the red cross and the united nations children fund already in operation within nicaragua and along the honduran and costa rican borders to noncombatant children under the age of 15 the aid will be distributed by giving highest priority to those children on both sides of the war with the greatest need for assistance by making available prosthetic devices and rehabilitation provide medicine and immunization for more than 100 000 children assist burn victims and provide relief to all nicaraguan children physically injured or displaced by the nicaraguan conflict no funds will go to or through the government of nicaragua this humanitarian aid package will also include 1 4 million in assistance to the miskito indians through the international red cross so long as there is a cessation of hostilities and progress toward a negotiated ceasefire continues the miskito indians and the government of nicaragua reached a ceasefire agreement earlier this year the democratic package also includes an immediate end to all lethal aid to the contras including weapons and ammunition the leadership of congress and the gao will monitor the shipment of food blankets and medical supplies to the contras which will be accomplished by dod private contractors to assure no lethal aid is quietly included deliveries will be inspected onsite by officials of the gao while oversight of the operation lies with the intelligence committees of congress if a ceasefire is in place before the end of june 1988 then unitedstates humanitarian assistance automatically continues through international agencies in accordance with a ceasefire agree ment ii no ceasefire is in place by the end of june unitedstates assistance comes to a halt the one clear fact is that this war despite the efforts of the administration is winding down the humanitarian aid package is not designed to encourage continued warfare but to assist those who have fought in the transition to peace the contras are not nor will they ever be the solution to the conflict in central america that policy has failed for 7 years and never again will the america people tolerate millions of taxpayer dollars to go unaccounted for and countless spending violations to occur in carrying out this administrations thoughtless policy toward central america the humanitarian aid package that i will support today prevents misuse of the public trust and money it also prevents the escalation of the war in nicaragua this alternative ensures a commitment by our government to economic development social justice and true humanitarian aid to the children of nicaragua the primary effort for peace in central america must continue to rest with people of that region not the united states a negotiated ceasefire can only be accomplished by factions currently involved in the conflict continuing to meet and work out their differences american negotiators did not bring about the peace accord the five central american presidents accomplished the agreement not imposed on them from the outside and it is up to those leaders to bring about a lasting ceasefire and cessation of the conflict although our vote today will not finally end the war it can help end the administrations united states military option in nicaragua it will strengthen the congressional coalition aimed at supporting peace and ending military aid it will strengthen president arias and the peace plan by keeping diplomatic solutions alive let todays vote reflect another chapter in the effort to explore every avenue for peace while moving toward diplomacy human rights and multilateral solutions in central america"], [0.0015254616737365723, 0.9984745383262634, 1, "we will all miss our colleague sala burton very much it is very difficult to express what she meant to us we will miss her caring her commitment her friendship i will miss our conversations on the floor of the many moving words said of sala in recent days i think that these words spoken at her memorial service in san francisco by frank kielinger gave the greatest sense of who sala and phil burton were frank kieliger worked with and for the burtons for many years i would like to insert his remarks in the record yesterday as we stood in this rotunda and watched the people of san francisco pay tribute to sala there was a moment of overpowering grief and loss and i said to my son this is the last time we will see sala later as we walked in the dark through the plaza outside this teenager said to me dad your wrong look around you well isee sala every time we see these people only she would notice we had just passed one of the confused and homeless night people and we were in sight of the tents of those seeking help for aids victims by demonstrating at the old federal building in a single sentence he had captured sala he had told me her story elie wiesel in his work souls on fire tells us of the role of story and memory in our lives he writes my father an enlightened spirit believed in man my grandfather a fervant hasid believed in god the one taught me to speak and the other to sing both loved stories and when i tell mine i hear their voices whispering from beyond the silenced storm they are what links the survivor to their memory we are here today to refresh our memories and to renew our commitments to all that sala burton represents in her life we come to share our stories of her i leave to others the task of commenting on her political prowess and her skills as a legislator the sala i knew and loved was larger then the sum of these parts 1 have asked myself over and over what made her so special and how can that specialness be expressed in brief remarks i have searched my thirty year recollection of her and what i find is a woman so secure in the knowledge of her own humanity so secure in knowledge of her own dignity and worth as a person that she would spend her life defending the dignity and worth of others sala was a woman who could talk to me when i was a young man about the worlds indifference to the approaching holocaust and of her own personal experiences of eastern european antisemitism and of fleeing poland she could do so without hate but with a fierce determination that the story be told for sala this bitter lesson of the past must be alive in our memory so that this most heinous crime against humanity can never happen again she told me the story sala was a woman who lived rather than preached the values of her jewish heritage in her struggle for peace in the world for an end to the arms race for a world freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation in her opposition to the immoral practice of hiring mercenaries by funding the contras in nicaragua there can be heard the echoes of the prophet isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and nations shall make war no more in salas ceaseless quest for a just and more humane society a society which recognizes its obligations to the poor the aged the infirmed the homeless and all who are dispossessed in this land she made tangible the words of micah you have been told 0 man what is good and what is required of you to live justly to show mercy and to walk humbly with your god for sala accidents of race color creed national origin ancestry gender or sexual orientation could never be excuses for denying the inherent dignity of the human person and her life is summed up in the struggle to make that ideal a reality it was sala who introduced me to the reality of racial discrimination and racism and who educated me and formed my conscience on these issues as she involved me in the struggle for fair employment practices and fair housing in our state so many years ago it was sala who introduced me to the concept that the magnificent document we call the constitution of the united states protects all or it protects none it was sala who opened my eyes to the dangers of mccarthyslm and to its remnants in our society as we stood in union square and listened to phil then in the assembly call for the abolition of the house committee on un american activities some of us can still remember the picture of the hoses being turned on demonstrators and the water cascading down these very stain as dedicated civil libertarians were dragged down them for protesting the presence of that comnittee in our city and sala would feel deep anger at the sight of this injustice for sala was a woman whose conscience was so finely honed whose perceptions of social justice and human rights were so clear that she was truly a woman well ahead of her time she was a pioneer ever pressing forward ever encouraging the more fainthearted of us to follow where phil would move mountains by the shear volume of his knowledge and the weight of his arguments sala would touch the heart would prick the conscience would call us to be what we can and should be concerned and caring human beings when phil might seem preoccupied or distant in his singlemindedness sala was always the embodiment of care and concern they were a unique team their lives were both public and private and it is in the private moments that their great love and respect for one another was most evident and as i say these words i can envision phil even now reaching over and grasping her hand in a gesture which in life spoke volumes they are once again together they are once again an invincible team i have spoken of the sala i know with a very special affection it was she after all who suggested to phil many years ago that he hire me on a six month trial that six months stretched into twenty five rewarding years in which i learned from them that the purpose of public life is service that power is always exercised in behalf of the powerless and that those who possess the platform for public debate have the obligation to eloquently and forcefully express the aspiration of those in our society who are voiceless that is my story of sala burton the sala i will remember every time i see the faces of the people she saw and whose dignity she defended it is my prayer that the god of abraham our god who blessed her and kept her in life who made his continence to shine upon her with a special radiance will now grant her peace sala we loved you we will remember you and we will retell you story for years to come"],

essential to the revitalization of american industry and the economic wellbeing of many of this countrys working men and women the trade deficit in this country has dramatically increased since the reagan administration took office rising from 40 billion in 1981 to over 170 billion in 1986 the administration has demonstrated that it is unable to respond satisfactorily to our evergrowing trade problem leaving congress no option but to step in with a legislative remedy h r 3 is such a remedy and is an appropriate and long overdue answer to our astounding trade deficit of special importance to my home state of west virginia are the provisions in the bill which deal with trade adjustment assistance worker benefits and other worker retraining and assistance programs the rate of unemployment in west virginia remains one of the highest in the nation and the state has the additional dubious distinction of having the highest rate of job loss due to plant closings in the country h r 3 modifies the trade adjustment assistance program in a manner which will be very beneficial to west virginia the bill specifies that all workers certified for assistance under taa would be entitled to up to 4 000 in training and remedial education benefits if the cost of the services provided is less than 4 000 the remainder could be used to pay relocation expenses presenilty workers receiving taa assisance apply for specific training and education programs and the amount of services provided to individual workers varies depending on the programs and their availability by creating an entitlement program the bill would ensure that all workers will receive an adequate level of service the bill creates a new option of supplemental wage payments under taa for workers who take a new job that pays less than their previous job specifically workers would be entitled to receive a supplemental wages 50 percent of their taa unemployment allowances subject to the limit that their new wages and supplement combined could not exceed 80 percent of their previous wage the typical supplement would be about 2 per hour and could continue for up to 1 year under the bill workers eligible for taa would be permitted to choose between undergoing retraining or taking a lesser paying job this option is especially important to older workers who may not wish to undergo retraining and begin a new career new badly needed funding sources for taa are established in h r 3 language in the bill specifies that any tariff revenues collected as a result of import relief or unfair trade actions are to be deposited in a special adjustment industry trust fund within the treasury to be used to help support taa or any other federal program that might be established for communities in which a substantial number of workers or firms are certified for ta expenditures from the trust fund would still be subject to annual appropriations title v of the bill establishes a new program of great importance to west virginia entitled worker readjustment which would provide comprehensive services to dislocated workers who have lost their jobs due to plant closings layoffs or other major disruptions this includes but is not limited to workers directly affected by increased imports h r 3 authorizes a total of 980 million for the new worker readjustment program for fiscal year 1988 the bill directs each state to establish a tripartite council to oversee the operation of the new program the councils would be composed of equal numbers of representatives from labor management and public and nonprofit organizations in addition the bill requires each state to designate a rapid response team or office within the state government which can respond immediately to major plant closings these teams would assist workers with reemployment employee buyouts enrollment in training progams and early retirement planning and would provide other social services under the bill 30 percent of the funds for the adjustment program would be allocated to basic readjustment servicesservices to meet the immediate needs of workers following a plant closing these services include job placement assistance counseling and job clerks up to 15 percent of funds for basic services could be used for supplemental income and supportive services for displaced workers no more than 15 percent of the funds could be used for administrative costs onehalf of the funds under the new adjustment program would be used for retraining and longterm adjustment assistance to displaced workers including classroom training literacy workshop onthejob training and remedial education the bill specifies that to the maximum extent possible workers should be given training certificates or vouchers so that they can select and arrange their own retraining up to 30 percent of this category of funds could be used for supplementary income and supportive services for displaced workers who otherwise could not afford to enter such retraining funds would be distributed among the states based on a weighted formula which takes into account each states unemployment rate its unemployment rate relative to other states and its longterm unemployment rate as a state with chronically high unemployment rates west virginia would receive a fair share of these funds finally the remaining 20 percent of the adjustment funds would be allocated at the discretion of the secretary of labor for special projects of national or regional concern these projects could include industrywide activities technical assistance responses to mass layoffs or demonstration projects to reiterate while h r 3 is a highly complex piece of legislation which deals with many aspects of this countrys trade policy i am especially supportive of the worker retraining provisions in the bill these provisions will go a long way toward alleviating the hardship and stress brought about by the unfair trading practices of many of this

short notice to eulogize sala and to say how much they loved her and how much they would miss her i have to say i was surprised because i thought she was just my special friend i thought that she was a political acquaintance to the other members of the house and she was a colleague to her colleagues from california but that she was my special friend i realize today that that was salas special gift

jeanclaude paul commander of the powerful dessaline battalion in haitis capital has been under suspicion of drug smuggling since 1986 sources say but only recently have investigators compiled enough evidence to proceed with grandjury activity and possible indictment ile would apparently be charged with aiding the flow of colombian cocaine to the unitedstates and of arms from the unitedstates to colombia sources say some sources say an indictment is imminent but given secrecy of the process others are unsure if colonel paul is indicted the case will severely challenge haitian president leslie manigat who has pledged a crackdown on drug smugglers though unitedstates officials were unwilling to discuss the judicial investigation they said an indictment could call into question the arrangements by which mr manigat came to power if he tries to fire paul unitedstates congressional sources say that will view this as a serious litmus test of civilian control in haiti and of how the unitedstates should deal with the new regime pauls unit is viewed as the most important in the country and his troops are fiercely loyal to him unitedstates officials say this makes it very difficult for haitis president or pauls nominal military superiors to move against him wellinformed haitians say paul has warned that he will not go down alone if others try to remove him paul allegedly played a major role in directing violence that upset the november elections in haiti because of close ties to the tonton macoutes the secret police created during the duvalier dictatorship the violence and killing paved the way for manigats election last month paul is seen as very close to the gen william regala who was no 2 man in haitis transitional junta and may be named defense minister he is the muscle and regala is the brain says a haitian opposition source but paul has an independent power base since becoming commander of the dessaline barracks in early 1986 he has assiduously wooed his troopsdining with them wearing fatigues like theirs supplementing their pay with bonuses allegedly funded from drug trafficking washington sources say they will kill at his command a haitian opposition source says paul has also reportedly incorporated several thousand tonton macoutes into his unit making it even more formidable us officials say hes got all the guns one us specialist says washington first raised reports of pauls activities in the transitional haitian government in 1986 but received no satisfactory reply officials say after the initial us complaints an internal haitian military investigation was launched haitian exile sources say the final report reportedly confirmed the charges and included aerial photos of pauls farm with a private landing strip but after the army chief of staff presented it to gen henri namphy the thenacting head of government the investigating officers were reportedly transferred and accused of plotting a coup the army chief of staff and the colonel in charge of the investigation were subsequently forced to retire us officials could not confirm the haltians charges while stressing their lack of knowledge of the us judicial investigation

haitian consul in miami is reported to have been in that earlier operation and the current one they say colombian cocaine and marijuana were reportedly the staples of this trade informed haitians here say that paul is well tied into the tonton macoutes in part because his father was in the personal entourage of franqois duvalier who founded the group to keep the military and opponents in line pauls reported ill deeds go beyond drugs a reuter dispatch from haiti reports that he and his two brothers arranged to receive the 4 000 tons of waste from the city of philadelphia dumped on the haitian

contain high levels of dioxin press reports say the paul brothers reportedly received 200 a ton to accept the ash washington will be watching carefully how the haitian government reacts if the

you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the

holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala

and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble

second and third installments of contra aid will be made available in order to give the house and senate select committees time to complete their investigations of the iranian arms scandal this is not the first time i have stood on this floor to talk about legality and fiscal accountability in the contra aid program last march i stood here because we did not know where 27 million in contra aid had gone we were reading stories in the newspaper every day about money that may have been lost or diverted to honduras or used to buy weapons instead of food and medicine at that time i introduced a resolution of inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter as a result of my resolution and the investigations which followed we learned that onehalf of the 27 million appropriation is missing we may never know where that money went we may never know whether money the congress appropriated for humanitarian aid was used to buy weapons and ammunition lastfall i stood here again when we were debating whether we should give another 100 million to the contras but i did not think we should spend another dime for the contras until weknew where the previous appropiation had gone so i introduced an amendment to prohibit any aid for the contras until we knew where the 27 million had gone my amendment lost and the house sent the unfortunate message that legality and fiscal accountability did not matter in the contra aid program one month later we learned that the united states had secretly sold weapons to iran and then diverted the profits from those arms sales to the contras and we found out that these diversions were made at a time when congress had specifically prohibited aid to the contras i had written to attorney general meese just 1 day before these disclosures were made to request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the arms shipments to iran and united states involvement with the contras at that time my concerns were based on news reports linking the administration to the hasenfus affair and on continuing evidence that the united states had been providing aid to the contras the very next day we learned how deeply involved the united states may actually have been with the contras according to attorney general meese between 10 million and 30 million in profits from these sales had been diverted to bank accounts held by the contras these diver sions had been made at a time when the boland amendment specifically prohibited aid to the contras in any form so i am standing here again and the questions are the same how much money was given to the contras where did the money come from was it done in violation of the law what was the money used for these are important questions and they demand answers but before we even have a chance to learn the answers the house may again face the issue of providing aid to the contras under the provisions of the aid law congress passed last year the 100 million appropriation for the contras was split into three installments a first installment of 40 million a second installment of 20 million and a final 40 million installment the first in stallment was released immediately but the second and third were delayed under the aid law the second installment is now available anytime the president wants to make use of it the third installment which is subject to a congressional resolution of disapproval is available after february 15less than 1 month from now the administration has not announced its intention to make use of the second installment and the third is not available until the middle of next month that means that 60 million in contra aid is waiting to be spent next month if the president decides he wants to apply the last installment of contra aid congress may pass a resolution of disapproval and try to prevent him from applying the aid but i do not think that we will have any clearer picture of the diversion issue in 3 weeks than we have right now we need more time and the american people need more time to learn the facts for this reason i am introducing legislation to push back the date on which the third installment becomes available from february 15 to november 15 the house investigating committee is expected to issue its final report on october 30 which would give the house 2 weeks to consider the results of that investigation before considering the release of funds for the contras in addition my legislation would place the second installment in escrow until november 15 as well my legislation allows for the changeover in fiscal years so that the money would still be earmarked for aid to the contras but it would not become available until we know more about the diversion issue after november 15 the president could report to congress on his intention to apply the remaining 60 million in appropriated funds for aid to the contras congress could still as under the original aid law pass a resolution of disapproval but instead of voting to disapprove of the third installment only the congress could vote to disapprove of the second installment as well let me make clear that my legislation would not alter the purpose of the original aid law if after november 15 the president wanted to use the 60 million for the contras and if there were no evidence at that time that a diversion might have taken place then the aid could be applied

been targeted part of our constitutionfirst amendment the breakins first came to my attention freedomsis being subverted in this adminis early in 1985 at the time the house judicitrations attempt to aid the contras in nicara ary committees subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights which i chair had gun been concerned about the admission by fbi since 1984 there have been more than 50 director william h webster that his agents breakins at churches residences and offices had interviewed approximately 100 ameriof opponents of administration policy in cen cans who had traveled to nicaragua this tral america all of the cases have one ele revelation was troubling because many of ment in common the intruders were more in those interviewed were understandably in terested in the organizations files and data timidated to have an fbi agent question them about their travel their humanitarian than anything of value work or their organizing efforts such acthe fbi has avoided efforts to discover tivities are protected under the first who is responsible for the breakins recent amendment the subcommittee made it fbi and justice department activitiesinter clear to webster that we wanted the fbi to viewing unitedstates travelers on their return from stay out of politics the breakinswhich numbered less than two dozen in 1985were an even more troubling form of harassment however i believed at the time and i still believe that all of these breakins could not be the work of the fbi while i still have concerns with the way the fbi operates a nationwide campaign of breakins is not among them burglaries as widespread and frequent as these would never get approved from the top and few agents in the field would risk their careers by undertaking such actions on their own there are two more likely sources for these breakins if they are indeed linked from the outset i have felt that the breakins may be the work of agents of one or more central american governments or of factions representing the ruling classes in those countries we know that in the past violent governments have sent their agents to the us to harass and intimidate their opponents here the shah of iran and marcos of the philippines both had active intelligence operations in this country which spied on and harassed americans and foreign nationals alike the rightwing government of chile was involved in the car bombing in washington that killed orlando letelier is history repeating itself are foreign agents now carrying out breakins against sanctuary churches and opponents of the administrations militaristic policy in central america another possibility is that the breakins are the work of rightwing groups who support the contras and us policy in central america we know there was a private network established to raise money for the contras we also know that some members of the network were active in promoting the administrations views it is possible that they were interested as well in frustrating the efforts of groups opposing those views and sought to collect information about them unfortunately we may never know the answers to these questions i have urged the fbi to investigate the breakins but webster has declined citing advice from the department of justice which has concluded that there is no federal jurisdiction under continued pressure from the subcommittee the fbi has conducted a preliminary inquiry into breakins at two locations robert whites office and the old cambridge baptist church but by all indications these are cursory investigations and are unlikely to resolve the matter the fbi has categorically denied that it is behind the breakins while i agree that the fbi itself is probably not directly responsible for these breadins related matters involving the bureau and other federal law enforcement agencies give us concern first while adamantly denying involvement in these breakins the fbi continues to insist that it has the authority to carry out breakins and admits that it has done so in other cases in an executive order issued in 1981 president reagan delegated to the fbi the authority to carry out unconsented physical searches of the homes autos and offices of persons suspected of being agents of foreign powers under this authority the fbi claims the power to surreptitiously break into someones house without a warrant if the attorney general determines on his own that the target is an agent of a foreign power unfortunately the definition of agent of foreign power may be broad enough to cover americans criticizing administration foreign policy i strongly be lieve that such breakins are unconstitutional but the issue has never been resolved equally troubling and possibly relevant here is the fact that the fbi guidelines on intelligence gathering which are supposed to limit the circumstances in which agents may carry out breakins expressly do not apply to the receipt by the fbi of any information property or materials furnished by individuals acting on their own initiative this seems to mean that the fbi will accept from private parties the fruits of breakins that fbi agents cannot carry out themselves again the fbl has denied that it has obtained any evidence from breakins at sanctuary churches or offices of administration opponents but my subcommittee would like to know what type of informa tion the fbi does receive from private parties and whether any of it relates to reagan administration opponents a third matter of grave concern is the tale told by frank varelli of dallas tx the fbi admits that varelli was a paid informant for the bureau and that he infiltrated the committeen solidarity with thepeople of el salvador cispes for four and a half years from 198l to 1985 cispes was the subject of an intensive fbi investigation and varelli was a main source of information in that case in a dramatic appearance before our subcommittee in february varelll testified that fbi agents he worked with in dallas told him that they had broken intobethany house a religious comr munity where cispes dallas office was located the fbi has denied that fbl agents carried out such breakins it has promised to respond to the subcommittee in fullto varellis allegations but to date has not done so claiming that its investigation into the allegations is continuing finally several of the targets of breakins are themselves the subjects of fbi files documents obtained under the freedom of information act show that both the north american congress on latin america burglarized may 21 or 22 1986 and the new institute of central america burglarized at least four times since 1984 are the subjects of fbi investigations recently fbi agents sought to question nearly a dozen volunteers for tecnica which provides technical aid to nicaragua through american volunteers these cases on top of the cispes investigation suggest that the fbi is again investigating groups opposed to present us foreign policy and we have the shocking case of operation sojourner the immigration and naturalization service investigation in the southwest where for the first time in our history undercover informants went into churches wearing concealed microphones and recorded meetings and services the fbi has repeatedly denied that it is investigating the sanctuary movement but the use of undercover informants in churches by another component of the justice department has fueled the fears of many that this administration recognizes no limits inits efforts against its opponents the breakins remain an unsolved mystery the issues involved go far beyond the breakins themselves they include the balance between national security and civil liberties the role of dissent in a free society and the extent to which there has been a privitization of intelligence gathering they call into question whether and to what extent the fbi still collects intelligence on domestic critics of administration policy on april 8 the interfaith peace coalition housed in the holy redeemer lutheran church in my hometown of san jose ca was broken into the burglars were more aggressive than in earlier cases a phone was ripped out files were turned upside down a television set was smashed as fbi director webster prepares to become head of the cia as congressional committees trace the money trail from the iranian arms sales and as an independent counsel examines whether the private contra aid effort broke any laws a few of us in congress are determined that the breakins not be forgotten

the gentleman from new york who preceded me discussing the tragic situation in haiti he has shown a great deal of interest in and concern for the people of haiti and i think he speaks quite sensibly about what we ought to be doing but i want to talk tonight about the presidential campaign some of the members across the aisle have decided that this is an appropriate forum in which to do campaigning i will have to concede that i have not done the research that some of my colleagues on the side have done and i do not have a lot of quotations to offer it always seems to me that if people want to read those things they can read them on their own i want to talk about some aspects of the campaign that are distressing to me and i know that my friend the gentleman from new york and some others want to join in one of the things that struck me is the extent to which vice president bush feels compelled on important issues to be obedient to the rightwing in this country it is interesting that george bush when he ran for president in 1080 and was defeated by ronald reagan was seen as a more moderate candidate than than ronald reagan and interestingly as we look at the reagan candidacy and look at the bush candidacy we see in the case of george bush in my view much more of a willingness to toe the line than the rightwing sets ronald reagan himself felt rooted in that conservative movement and as one who was confident of his own place in that conservative movement he felt much freer to disagree with people in the conservative movement when he thought common sense required him to do so for instance we had the case of the inf treaty when the great majority of the conservative movement as they call themselves in this country reacted quite angrily to the inp treaty ronald reagan had the selfconfidence to say that they were acting in an even more bizarre fashion than some of them usually do and he went ahead with it george bush unlike ronald reagan is unsure of himself with that rightwing which has become such an important element in the republican party and therefore when the rightwing growls on its key issues george bush unlike ronald reagan is paralyzed and will not disagree we have had example after example this year of george bush being held to a standard by the rightwing which is in my judgment damaging to the country we begin with the choice of his vice president no one outside of his immediate family thinks that dan quayle is qualified to be the vice president of the united states i do not know how his immediate would vote on a secret ballot george bush picked him because he was given a very short list by the far right when ronald reagan had to pick a vice presij nt he did not feel he owed the far right a veto over his choice because he picked a man george bush who did not at that time look that attractive to him george bush of course has spent the intervening 8 years trying very hard to kowtow to the far right so they would no longer be vetoing him people might remember the famous trek george bush made a couple of years ago to speak at a dinner in honor of the late william loeb publisher of the manchester unionleader an extraordinarily virulent unfair rightwing newspaper publisher who had denounced george bush but bush was so eager to win back the rightwing and to release that rightwing opposition to him that he humbled himself before the unionleaders people well george bush had to pick a vice president and unlike ronald reagan george bush felt he could not do anything the rightwing would have objected to so he picked for vice president probably the least qualified nominee for national office on a major party ticket in a very very long time i confess i am not fully cognizant of all the more obscure vicepresidential nominees earlier in this century but of those i can think of in the last 50 years the current vicepresdential nominee dan quayle is clearly the least qualified but that is not even controversial why was he picked because the rightwing gave george bush a short list it had on it a couple of people like our colleague the gentleman from new york george bush did not want to pick him he thought he might be overshadowed so he picked someone the rightwing would accept someone who would not overshadow him so that is how he picked quayle george bush suggested about a month ago that we should not go full speed ahead with the installation of the star wars antimissile device because it is going to cost hundreds and hundred of millions of dollars in violation of the antiballistic missile treaty that was richard nixons accomplishment and it could be destabalizing to our efforts to get a substantial nuclear arms reduction agreement with the russians george bush suggested that and then the rightwing growled then george bush unsuggested it on issue after issue after issue of central importance picking a vice president american defense george bush makes moves that are calculated to please the rightwing and i think that is terribly dangerous it is why we have george bush among other things talking about the relationship between the united states and the soviet union in terms far to the right of ronald reagan ronald reagan has achieved with general secretary gorbachev some real gains one of our great hopes is that we will be able to build on that not out of any love for or trust of the soviet union but out of a recognition that we have mutual interests that we are trying to deal with both the strategic and economic impact of an allout arms race george bush has been forced by his fear of the rightwing to back off on that we had another example in fact this has been a good week for george bush i should give credit where credit is due he has not had to fire one antisemi ie from his campaign this whole week i think that is about the first time in a long time that he has not had to do that no one thinks george bush is himself antisemitic no one thinks that george bush was happy with some of the virulent antisemites who were on his ethnic outreach council why were they there because the rightwing gave him a list and because george bush does not have the political courage or toughness to challenge the rightwing he is a man who is politically paralyzed by fear of the rightwing on a few issues where they do not care they give him a little freedom he can go off on the minimum wage and that is ok he can take a little bit of freedom in another area but on the picking of the vicepresidential candidate the most important decision one can make when hie is about to become a presidential candidate on the question of star wars on relationships with the soviet union on his ethnic outreach council when the rightwing insists george bush is there that i believe is terribly dangerous when you have on the right people like pat robertson and others who have i think moved beyond the plausible in their advocacy when you have this blind unwillingness to recognize that there is a chance to reach based on mutual agreement and mutual interests an arms reduction pact with the russians i think that becomes very frightening so one of the central parts of the campaign that has emerged so far is the extent to which george bush unlike ronald reagan will not deviate in any significant area from the agenda of the far right and unfortunately that is a party that has taken up faction that has taken over more and more of the republican party we have the most extremely rightwing platform coming out of the republican party this year again to the right of where the reagan platforms were in 1980 and 1984 because ronald reagan as a genuine conservative with a sense of his own place was prepared to differ with the right george bush out of his own lack of rootedness politically and out of his own political timidity will not take on the far right they have defeated him too often george bush was for too many times in his career frustrated by the far right and he has decided that since he could not beat them that he will make obeyances to them and he has done that at every critical point in this year and in the last critical years at this point i am pleased to yield to the gentleman from new york my friend who i know has things he wants to add on this general subject"], [0.0018308162689208984, 0.9981691837310791,

the select committees investigating the irancontra affair have been filed with the house and senate on january 7 1987 by an overwhelming vote of 416 to 2 the house adopted house resolution 12 creating the select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran the previous day by another overwelmingly bipartisan vote of 88 to 4 the senate adopted senate resolution 23 creating the select committee on secret military assistance to iran and the nicaraguan opposition these committees were charged with important responsibilities although their chief function is to investigate those responsible for illegally selling arms to iran and providing unauthorized covert aid to the contras the committees were also specifically requested to review the international policy objectives of the united states and to make recommendations on legislative actions necessary or proper to reduce the harm to unitedstates policy that has been caused by the irancontra affair the resolution which i am introducing today simply postpones any consideration in the house of further aid to the contras until we have the benefit of the views of those committees as to the impact of the irancontra affair on unitedstates policy objectives and on what should be done to mitigate the harm done by that affair the resolution does not prohibit further aid to the contras or indeed prejudge the findings of those committees in any way it simply asks that we wait for the final verdict before entrusting further dollars and the public trust to those same officials and policies holding off a vote on contra aid until the reports of the select committees are filed would not impose a great delay the president is not expected to file his request for further aid to the contras before august or september the house select committee is scheduled to file its report by october 30 1987 the senate select committee which is currently scheduled to file its report by august 1 1987 will probably extend its deadline to the house date if the resolution which i am introducing today is adopted the house vote would be delayed only briefly i know that there will be some who will say there is no connection between the irancontra scandal and future policy but that is not true from what we know so far it is clear that some senior administration officials who are still centrally involved in promulgating and justifying our policy toward central america apparently lied to congress or tolerated lies by other officials in order to safeguard their policy objectives we must know whether they lied to congress before we can judge the validity of their calls for further aid to the contras we must know whether these are indeed individuals who would say anything to congress without regard for the truth to get more aid to the contras we must have that information before we vote on another aid request the other basis for this proposal is that we need to regain some control of the process under which we consider contraaid proposals assuming the expedited procedures for consideration of contra aid are retained we will have to make a decision on contra aid under a timetable determined by the administration and one which presumably will be favorable to the administation the formal request for aid may be timed to require a vote before the irancontra reports are filed or to coincide with a summit meeting or some other major event we cannot control completely the impact of outside events on our votes but we can and should control the impact of events inside congress on our votes the single most significant event inside congress with a direct bearing on a vote on aid to the contras is the completion of the work of the select committees i think it is clear too that the american people see a connection between the completion of the hearings and a vote on contra aid the american people are entitled to a full accounting of the policies and actions surrounding contra aid before not after a vote on any request for more taxpayer dollars to support the same policies there is little reason to hold such extensive hearings if congress and the nation cannot consider the lessons learned from this scandal in developing future policy the purpose of the irancontra hearings has been not only to expose wrongdoing but to come to a better understanding of those who engaged in these unlawful activities and of the processes which allowed these activities to occur we should have the opportunity to reflect on that information before we decide how we will vote on further aid to the contras

member who was respected by all because of his capacity for hard work his levelheaded commonsense approach toward reaching reasonable compromises his genuine concern for those in need and his total integrity eddid boland is a man you can talk to work with and the job will get done you can absolutely rely on his word without any exception when congressman boland tells you he will do something you

surpasses chairman bolands command of the facts and history related to the bills he managed on the house floor in managing those bills over the years chairman boland was formidable but was also without exception courteous and fair with his opponents on the matters in dispute he usually got his way on his bills but he conducted himself always as a gentleman with courtesty to those on the other side and with respect for their views over the years chairman boland fought for adequate public housing and the enhancement of a number of programs administered by the department of housing and

this house than eddie boland for 18 years chairman boland has brought his appropriations bills forward from his subcommittee with as much money for the benefit of our veterans as the budget would or could permit he has been solid as granite in his commitment to our veterans and has fought for their benefits and medical construction projects throughout the country in my own congressional district the list of veterans administration medical care facilities built or under construction is longer than my arm each and every one of them was absolutely needed by the veterans in my part of the country the benefits these projects have been to my veterans are incalculable the quality of the health care they are receiving is improving substantially and will continue to increase because of these projects funded by chairman bola nds bills his efforts helped in the construction of a medical school in my district and today it bears my name and without his help that medical school would not have

however he was careful to advance his views in a manner which would not jeopardize the spirit of goodfaith cooperation and consultation between the congress and the administration and this spirit of good faith is essential if such cooperation and consultation is to continue into the future in my view chairman boland showed us the way and for this he deserves our commendation so as eddie boland

project was authorized and appropriated in fiscal year 1983 a competitve bid contract was awarded to the lowest of five bidders in september 1983 for a fixed price contract in the amount of 102 940 million the twostep formally advertised selection process for this project required the contractor to submit a design that would meet the governments stated minimum requirements in the first phase and them to submit a bid based upon his own design and specifications for the second phase while the government detemined that the contractors design for the project was technically acceptable in the light of the minimum contract requirements the government did not create the design last year as the steam plant was nearing completion the contractor apparently discovered that his design was in error and had come up approximately 10 million short in title ii of the defense appropriations conference report of last year there is a provision in the defense claims section that in effect provides 10 million for the private relief of this contractor as a result of his losses on this project the enacted legislation of last year allows the contractor to escape responsibility for the design he developed and the competitive bid he submitted based on that design this private relief legislation flies in the face of the competitive bidding process and the concept of a firm fixed price contract it would in effect make the contract cost reimbursable without the proper oversight for such a method of procurement and without fair competition by others who might have pursued such a procurement the legislation in last years appropriations act is unnecessary if the losses were occasioned by government action and through no fault of the contractor the proper procedure would be for the contractor to file a claim pursuant to the contract disputes act if there is right under the contract to recover for the losses the contractor may request relief pursuant to public law 85804 congress adopted that law to authorize an agency to provide equitable relief to contractors under extraordinary circumstances standards for relief established pursuant to that law provide the necessary safeguards to ensure that relief will be granted only when appropriate my amendment would simply remedy what i feel is legislation that is seriously flawed of greater concern is the dangerous precedent the present legislation sets by undermining existing laws this legislation releases contractors from obligations to perform work based on their own design and at a price they competitively established my amendment puts the process back on track if the contractor has a legitimate claim the department of the navy under existing law will provide compensation i urge my colleagues to

as i watched the president deliver his speech last night i was impressed with mr reagans consistencythe strength of his convictions the presidents message was classic reagan he projected a strong feeling of confidence and hope for the future once again mr reagan stood firm in his commitment to rebuild the strength of america at home and abroad his call for bipartisan cooperation is critically important as we face a number of challenges in the 100th congress in particular his call for reform of the current unworkable federal budget process and his initiatives to make us more competitive in world markets are absolutely essential for the future on the issue of competitiveness in international markets i support the presidents strong stand against unfair trading practices on one hand and protectionism on the other hand i join with my colleagues in calling for development of a trade policy that is based on the positive approach being taken by the reagan administration to reverse the dangerous trend toward higher and higher trade deficits mr reagans continued support for reform of our current catastrophic health care system addresses a critically important need among millions of senior citizens nationwide this ongoing effort which began with the presidents call for action in his 1986 state of the union message is a major breakthrough in our fight to bring both public and private medical insurance programs into the 1980s the need for a federal health care policy that is familyoriented and emphasizes the real needs of our senior citizens and disabled americans is a top priority of those of us in congress who have seen the shortcomings of the current health insurance system mr reagans renewed support for catastrophic health care is very important to millions of senior citizens in need of this important program we had reached a crossroad as a nation when mr reagan took office in 1981 in a firm and consistent way mr reagan has proven that his critics were wrong about him and about his policies last night mr reagan reminded us that we have come a long way together but that we still have a number of important challenges ahead of us as a nation there has been a great deal said recently about the decisionmaking process within the reagan white house as congress takes up the presidents challenge to complete the important work we have begun we should be equally conscious of the decisionmaking process at work within the capitol we need to look toward the future as the president has done and take up the challenges that we face together as a nation i

the establishment of a unitedstates decade for natural disaster reduction on december 11 1987 the united nations passed a resolution to designate the 1990s as a decade in which the worlds community of nations will devote increased attention to fostering international cooperation in the field of natural disaster reduction this is an important and appropriate objective for all governments to pursue because the natural hazards of earthquakes hurricanes floods windstorms volcanoes wildfires and drought take their tolls in lives and human suffering without regard to national boundaries it is estimated that approximately 3 million people around the world have lost their lives as the results of natural hazards over the past 20 years and the lives of another 800 million people have been adversely affected certainly hurricane gilbert and its disastrous effects on jamaica and other caribbean nations mexico and the united states is just the most recent example of the international magnitude of natural disasters the goals of the international decade for natural disaster reduction are to improve the capacity of each nation to mitigate the effects of natural disasters within its own boundaries and to also do so in cooperation with other nations the initiative will have a scientific and engineering component which will address risk assessment and engineered solutions participation by the united states will assure that existing and new national efforts such as the national earthquake hazard reduction program will effectively contribute to a worldwide reduction in

congress and the president on this bill is essential due to the delay in reauthorizing this legislation our states have run out of funds to maintain and improve our highway and mass transit resources failure to pass this important legislation will only further threaten the loss of the 1987 construction season threatening thousands of jobs in the construction industry i strongly believe that the federal government must provide stable and adequate funding so that the states will be able to provide for their future transportation needs the highway trust fund which is funded with revenues from the federal gas tax has adequate funds to finance the more than 86 billion for our highway and mass transit programs over the next 5 years the maintenance and improvement of our transportation infrastructure is vital to our nations economic wellbeing with 20 percent of our gross national product generated through transportation we cannot afford to delay this program any further i urge my colleagues to put aside their differences so that this money can be delivered to the states for the approaching construction season this bill is good for new jersey and the nation it will bring over 313 million in federal highways and 186 million in mass transit money to new jersey this year at a time when new jersey is working to complete a number of important highway projects this bill provides funds that are an essential element of the state transportation trust fund in the 11 th congressional district for example interstates such as routes 24 287 280 and 80 need the federal dollars that this reauthorization ensures h r 2 also provides almost 1 billion in mass transit capital and operating assistance to new jersey over the next 5 years as our highways reach their capacity mass transit becomes more and more important in new jersey mass transit users will be the prime beneficiary of these funds as new jersey transit strives to meet the needs of the new jersey commuter the bill authorizes 68 6 billion over the next 5 years from the trust fund for the completion and maintenance of our nations highway program it also authorizes 17 8 billion for mass transit capital and operating assistance over the same period by passing this bill we will minimize program disruption project delays and job dislocation delays cost money the states are waiting for us to provide them
