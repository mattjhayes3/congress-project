so many tough issues that were dealing with tonight were joining with the congressional prochoice caucus of which im also a member and so im very pleased to be down here with my colleagues to discuss this critical issue a very sad day quite frankly for women in this country and especially for poor women for african american women for women of color this bill which was passed today is really just the newest attack in what i have been calling from day one the republican war on women today instead of focusing on ways to find jobs for americans the republicans are focusing on eliminating family planning programs undercutting womens right to choose and returning our country unfortunately to the days of backalley abortions which i remember very well h r 358 the protect life actcan you believe that protect life act forces coverage for women to be dropped from state exchanges which will cut off millions of women from affordable comprehensive health care in fact this bill makes it virtually impossible for any health care plan to offer abortion coverage and allows hospitals to refuse to provide lifesaving care to a woman who needs an abortion to protect her own life this is unprecedented and it should have been rejected on this floor this legislation really though is part of a coordinated nationwide war on women just last week the republicancontrolled house foreign affairs committee voted to defund the united nations population fund an organization that supports lifesaving activities for women and families in postconflict and disaster situations and before that the very same committee voted to reinstate the global gag rule which prevents health care providers from even discussing or offering comprehensive health services to women and girls this affects women and girls in subsaharan africa who bear the brunt of the global aids pandemic and of course as usual the republicans have targeted planned parenthood putting increased requirements on how this nonprofit which provides affordable health care to lowincome women black women women of color latino women asianpacific american womenif planned parenthood wants to receive federal funding they have to stop mind you providing women reproductive health choices which really is only a tiny percentage of what planned parenthood offers to women sadly it does not end there its nothing less than shocking that after holding the fiscal year 2011 budget hostage over their controversial policy proposals the antichoice leaders in the house seem eager to pick up some of the very same fights once again this year the republican appropriations bill continued this attack on womens reproductive health by eliminating title x the nations family planning program defunding planned parenthood cutting funding for sciencebased teenage pregnancy prevention initiativesprevention mind youand redirecting those funds into failed abstinenceonly programs and the list goes on so lets just return to the battle though that took place today in putting forward this very divisive bill republicans made the false claim that the affordable care act needs to be amended to ensure that united states taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions the fact of the matter is that its very disingenuous and its just wrong and its really amazing that that argument could even be put out there because the fact is the hyde amendment has been in effect for decades since 1976 and the affordable care act continues the hyde amendment policy despite my personal view that it should be overturned the republicans continue to invent new ways to try and erode and deny women their constitutionally guaranteed rights purely on religious beliefs and on ideology this is a democracy this is not a theocracy the religious views of someand i am a woman of faith but i have to tell you the religious views the personal religious views of some should not dictate public policy for all im also aware of the fact that sometimes we as a nation really dont give young women and girls the right tools to prevent unintended pregnancies in the first place but the fact of the matter is this republican war on women and this bill will put more lives at risk isolate us from women who have no money who are poorespecially women of color who have become really central targets of these efforts evidence of this is seen all over the country and very recently in the form of very offensive billboards that denigrated african american women in my own district in oakland californiawhich we fought against and which were quickly taken down now by using a combination or at least trying to use a combination of law and guilt these efforts undermine really the basic health care rights of women african american women lowincome women women of color as sistersong women of color reproductive justice collective states black women make decisions every day about whether to parent or not not just whether to give birth those who think they should dictate our choices wont be there when the child is born to help us fight for better education increase childcare keep our kids out of jail send our children to college or get affordable health care this war on women must stop we cannot and we must not allow the republicans to turn back the clock on women on choice and on our access to health care so i urge my colleagues to fight this war fight against these unnecessary and these harmful initiatives that keep coming forward that continue to do damage to women and that continue to try to erode our basic health care and basic human rights we need to create jobs rather than continue to deny health care to women thank you mr ellison our cochair of the progressive caucus for your leadership once again i want to thank you for your leadership on our jobs initiative on each and every effort that the congressional black caucus has mounted and thank you for joining with the congressional prochoice caucus in our efforts to protect women and

what his budget is all about i will say that i am getting unconfused because his budget is a destruction of the fabric and the way of life of all americans do you want to know what the republican budget does it cuts food assistance for struggling families it takes away affordable health care coverage for working families and of course it dismantles the health care safety net but also it deals with the education of our children as the cochair and founder of the congressional childrens caucus let me show you what happens when we dont educate our children we can see the numbers of individuals who are unemployed who have not had a high school degree our friends and the republican budget are going to cut education and theyre going to wind up with increasing unemployment because you can see that less of our americans are being able to go to college and therefore without college without a high school education we just undermine a growing childs opportunity let me tell you what else we do we go from children to their grandparents i remember standing on the floor of this house trying to prevent the doughnut hole from coming about but republicans again established a doughnut hole that millions of seniors have fallen through in fact the republican budget causes seniors to pay some 12 000 on their medicare listen to me clearly seniors you will be paying an extra 12 000 with the republican budget plan and of course we will open up the doughnut hole again the very doughnut hole that has been taken care of by the affordable care act on the other hand the democratic budget balances the budget and of course it recognizes the value of a shared sacrifice i just visited texas soldiers national guard they understand about shared sacrifice they support each other but this is a suicidal budget it has no shared sacrifice and all of the cuts come from the most vulnerable the republican plan is all about turning back the clock and throwing the poor people over the bridge that is what its all about it is a disgrace vote for the democratic budget mr chair i rise in opposition to the republican budget for fiscal year 2012 and beyond unlike the proposed democratic budget the republican budget purports to reduce our nations deficit by making disturbingly deep cuts to important programs and will have an adverse affect on our nations families children and the health of women the republican budget guts food assistance for struggling families the budget resolution calls for 127 billion in cuts to snap formerly called food stamps in a sixyear period 2015 through 2021 this proposal to blockgrant and reduce funding represents a cut of 25 percent in food benefits for some of the most vulnerable americans states will be forced to cut benefits to some households or create waiting lists for needy families takes away affordable health coverage for millions of working families the majoritys budget resolution calls for 1 4 trillion in savings from repealing coverage provisions of the affordable care act which congress enacted a year ago to hold insurance companies accountable and extend health coverage to more than 30 million americans who would otherwise be uninsured this would mean repealing 777 billion in tax credits to help low and middleincome families afford health insurance coverage dismantles health care safety net for vulnerable populations the majoritys budget devastates health security for 28 million poor children 5 million seniors and 10 million disabled individuals who rely on medicaid for a basic safety net of health care to protect tax cuts for the wealthy the budget includes the absurd idea to dismantle the medicaid program and to let the chips fall where they may no matter who might get hurt the real hard choices are left to others state governors who will decide which populations or health services to drop health care providers whose medicaid payments might get cut so low they will have to decide whether they can afford to continue providing services to medicaid beneficiaries lowincome families who may have to decide between buying groceries and taking a sick child to a doctor and adults with aging parents who may have to decide between sending a child to college or paying for their parents longterm care the democratic budget democratic budget reduces the deficit responsibly reaches primary balance by 2018 the democratic budget reduces the deficit by 1 2 trillion more than the presidents budget over ten years includes pell grant and supplemental nutrition assistance snap initiatives the democratic budget includes two mandatory initiatives that are fully paid for with spending reductions first it includes the presidents proposed mandatory funding to sustain the maximum pell grant award at 5 550 in contrast to the republican budget which cuts pell grant funding substantially the democratic budget protects medicaid and the medicare guarantee for seniors the democratic budget protects medicares guarantee of health care coverage for seniors and disabled workers it also preserves the existing structure of medicaid that provides a health care safety net for vulnerable children families seniors and persons with disabilities in contrast the republican budget dismantles medicaid and ends medicare by converting it into an inadequate voucher for the purchase of private insurance i would urge all members of congress to oppose the republican budget and instead support the democratic budget to responsibly cut spending and give americas families women and children a chance"],

the new leadership has decided to start by debating h r 2 which will repeal patients rights put insurance companies back in charge and add to the deficit yesterday the democratic steering and policy committee held the only hearing the new congress will have on this bill we heard from families from maine to florida from rhode island to missouri real people real stories freedom was a common thread in their stories because of health care reform these families are free from worrying about being denied coverage because of a preexisting condition and free from worrying about escalating medical debt because of lifetime caps on their insurance plans these families now have a sense of security and peace of mind for over 37 years thanks to hawaiis landmark prepaid health care act our families have largely been protected from some of the most unfair insurance company practices but health care reform is still helping thousands of families and small businesses across my state a mother in kailua hawaii contacted me to tell me that she can now add her 21yearold son and 24yearold daughter to her worksponsored insurance plan this mom used to pay 900 a month for just her daughters health insurance and prescription drugs now she pays 300 a month to cover both of her children under her companys plan this family used to spend 10 800 a year for health care for one child now they spend 3 600 a year for health care for the entire family i recently heard from a senior in waimea on hawaii island who referred to her 250 medicare doughnut hole rebate check as a blessing in these tough economic times lets be clear the patients rights repeal act will hurt not help middle class families and small businesses in hawaii and across our nation i urge my colleagues to join me in voting against h r 2 listen to stacie ritters story stacie is the mother of twin daughters hannah and madeline now 11 who were diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 4 stacie has always worried about her daughters health and having health insurance to cover the stem cell transplants and other cancer treatments because of health care reform stacie doesnt have to worry about the twins being denied coverage because of a preexisting condition this repeal bill will allow insurance companies to deny hannah and madeline health insurance for the rest of their lives the 19 4 million children in our country with preexisting conditions would face the same fate listen to dr odette cohen from willingboro new jersey a small business owner the small business tax credits in the health care reform law not only lower the cost for her to provide good health insurance for her employees but they also give her the flexibility to hire another nurse practitioner shell be seeing more patients and growing her business and helping the economy according to forbes magazine major health insurance companies around the country are reporting a significant increase in small businesses offering health care benefits to their employees repeal would either force small businesses to drop their employees coverage or businesses would bear the full cost of insurance themselves speaker boehner has pledged to listen to the people because of hawaiis landmark prepaid health care act of 1974 which mandates that employers provide insurance coverage for their fulltime employees hawaiis families have largely been spared from some of the most unfair insurance practices but health care reform still helps thousands of families across our state a mother in kailua hawaii contacted me to thank us because she could now add her 21yearold son and 24yearold daughter to her worksponsored insurance plan this mom used to pay 700 a month for her daughters health insurance and 200 a month outofpocket for her prescription drugs now this mother pays just 300 a month to cover both of her children under her companys health plan this family used to spend 10 800 a year for health care for one child now they spend 3 600 a year for health care for the whole family this family is using the money saved on health insurance for other household needs including paying down past medical debt middle class families are saving money because of health care reform young adults many of whom are having a hard time finding jobs now have health insurance under h r 2 thousands of young adults will lose their insurance coverage including 2 500 in hawaii heres what else repealing health care reform will do to the people of hawaii 193 000 seniors in hawaii who have medicare coverage would be forced to pay a copay to receive important preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup visit so 193 000 seniors in hawaii who have medicare coverage would have to pay extra if they want to stay healthy by getting regular checkups in hawaii 17 959 medicare beneficiaries received a onetime taxfree 250 rebate to help pay for prescription drugs in the donut hole coverage gap in 2010 i recently heard from a senior in waimea on the island of hawaii who referred to this check as a blessing she was able to use that money to pay for her other medical bills medicare beneficiaries who fall into the donut hole in 2011 will be eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand name prescription drugs closing the medicare donut hole is an especially critical issue for hawaii as we are home to the nations largest percentage36 percent compared to 26 percentof medicare beneficiaries that fall into this gap of prescription drug coverage without repeal the burden of high prescription drug costs would hurt millions of medicare beneficiaries across the country an estimated 28 700 small businesses in hawaii would no longer be eligible for the new federal tax credits that will help make providing health care coverage for their employees more affordable lets be clear the patients rights repeal act will hurt not help middle class families in hawaii and

other things you name it they devastate it first the republican budget calls for a staggering 10 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations over 10 years it would pay for it by closing unspecified tax loopholes but this is a fraud for loophole closing of this magnitude the republicans would have to get rid of all the tax breaks the middle class depends on loopholes like the mortgage interest deduction the tax exclusion for employersponsored health insurance and charitable donations this wont happen which is why the republicans wont name any of their loophole closings the republican budget then proposes 5 3 trillion in nondefense discretionary spending cuts beyond what was agreed to in last years debt ceiling 1 2 trillion beyond it would slash 860 billion from medicare and all to pay for tax cuts because it wouldnt balance the budget until 2040 because these cuts are to pay for the tax cuts for the wealthy for shame mr chair i rise in strong opposition to the republican budget for fy13 as offered by mr ryan last year the republicans moved a slashandburn budget proposal that would have eliminated medicare and substituted for it a private voucher system and would have implemented devastating cuts to medicaid education programs medical research and transportation among other things you name it they wanted to devastate it now we turn to this years republican budget proposal and as one famous new yorker would say its d6ja vu all over again first the republican budget calls for a staggering 10 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy and large

devastating spending cutsnot to balance the budget but to pay for their tax cuts for the wealthy what priorities the republican budget seeks even deeper spending cuts than last years proposal it proposes 5 3 trillion in nondefense discretionary spending cuts 1 2 trillion 22 percent beyond the cuts agreed to in last years debt ceiling deal more than 60 percent of these cuts would come on the backs of middle and lowincome families for example the republican budget would slash 860 billion 34 percent from the medicaid program while turning it into an unguaranteed block grant these severe cuts would shift the cost burden to the states who would have to decide between investing even more of their own money cutting benefits shifting the cost onto beneficiaries doctors and hospitals throwing people out of the program or all of these the urban institute estimated that the republican plan would result in between 14 and 27 million people being dropped from medicaid by 2021 additionally the ryan budget would reduce food stamps by 134 billion knocking 8 to 10 million people from the program and leaving them to go hungry wic which provides nutritional assistance to women and children would also be cut taking food out of the mouths of 700 000 pregnant women new moms and their kids over the next decade nearly two million women and children would be left without access to critical food what kind of cruel and heartless country do the republicans want us to live in seniors on medicare dont fare much better first republicans would raise the eligibility age to 67 leaving seniors aged 65 and 66 out in the cold they would force seniors to go it alone in negotiating with private insurance companies for coverage seniors would receive vouchers to offset the cost of private insurancevouchers whose value would increase much more slowly than the cost of buying medical insurance cbo estimates that within ten years seniors would have to pay 6 000 more out of pocket

private insurance dont look to the republican plan for investments in infrastructure medical research or educationprimary or collegiate for students or for teachersbecause they are not there and the

tell him how proud he makes us all for his important work in constructing a democratic alternative to the republican budget that is mr van hollens budget proposal that is a statement of our national values that says to the american people what is important to you about the education health and wellbeing of our children the economic security of their families and the health security of our seniors those are important values to us and those values are reflected in the democratic alternative the republican ryan bill on the other hand i do not believe is a statement of our national values as to what is important to the american people as reflected in their budget priorities but you be the judge would it be a statement of your values if you had a budget that said to seniors were going to end the medicare guarantee and youre going to pay 6 000 or more while you get less in terms of benefits while at the same time were going to give an over 300 billion tax break to the wealthiest people in our country would that be a statement of your values this 6 000 more for seniors with fewer benefits 300 000 or more to the richest people in our country would it be a statement of your values for you my colleagues and the american people you represent if you had a budget that said to big oil were going to continue to subsidize you to the tune of tens of billions of dollars but at the same time were going to freeze pell grants were going to eliminate them for 400 000 young people and make them less available to over 9 million young people lower the benefits for some eliminate it for others and use the money to give tax subsidies to big oil big oil which is making tens of billions of dollars in record profits each year would it be a statement of your values if you said in your budget that all of those young people who are now children who have a preexisting medical conditionasthma diabetes birth defectany of those preexisting medical conditions under present law under the affordable care act they may not be discriminated against in obtaining health insurance but the republican budget says they should be because were going to eliminate that to the 2 5 million young people who are now on their parents policies until theyre 26 years old this budget says no to you too were eliminating that were too busy giving tax breaks to the richest people in america and while were at it with young people just graduating from college some of them may have student loans and in the house budgetthank you mr van hollenin the house budget we have a provision that says that come july 1 the interest on those loans will not double we have taken care of that under the circumstances the path were on the interest rates would go from 3 4 percent to 6 8 percent the house democratic budget says no to that doubling of interest the republican budget keeps it the same thats just to name a few things that i think may not be a statement of the values of the american people whether its interest paid on student loans availability of pell grants to young people ending the medicare guarantee and as the distinguished ranking member said right now today overturning the resources that were put in the affordable care act to reduce to narrow the doughnut hole maybe 5 million seniors have benefited to the tune of 3 2 billion already in the bill also there are preventative services there are annual wellness visits without a copay so were talking about kitchen table items for people where people are trying to make ends meet where people wonder about if their children will be able to go to college and if they do will they be able to have health insurance so that when they look for a job they can reach their aspirations without having their choices only narrowed by whether they have health insurance or not until the bill comes into full effect so there are just a couple of things that i would want people to know about this bill they are ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee while making seniors pay more for less while giving over 300 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and by the way did i mention it its a job loser so i urge my colleagues to enthusiastically support the house democratic proposal which is a statement of our values and which our distinguished colleague will presenti dont know if its tonight or tomorrow morning i understand that it keeps changing the house democratic alternative invests in americas priorities creates jobs protects our seniors and our students strengthens the middle class democrats protect medicare republicans dismantle medicare the democratic plan asks the wealthiest to pay their fair share and put our fiscal house in order the republican plan gives them more than the tax break theyve had they almost double their tax break our democratic plan reflects the most enduring theme in america the american dream democrats want to reignite the american dream to build ladders of opportunity for all who want to work hard play by the rules and take responsibility it does this by investing in small businesses and entrepreneurialism in our country by strengthening the middle class in that regard we believe that our budget is a statement of our values we call upon our republican colleagues to work with us on a budget that reflects our values we must work together to protect and strengthen medicare we must put people back to work and build a broadly shaped prosperity for all americans we must make it in america to stop the erosion of our manufacturing base we must rebuild america putting people back to work we must do this with community involvement and all of these things strengthen the middle class which is exactly what our democratic alternative achieves for the sake of our seniors for our families for our children for our workers i urge my colleagues to vote no on the republican plan which ends the medicare guarantee and makes seniors pay 6 000 or more for fewer benefits while it gives 300 000 in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the united states and it costs us jobs to do so and doesnt reduce the deficit

forward to a debate on the floor because as the chairman said we have very deep differences we do not have a difference on the question of whether or not we should reduce the deficits and the debt of course we do we have a difference over how to do that in that regard i rise in strong opposition to this republican plan and in support of the democratic alternative the republican budget on the floor of the house today is simply the sequel to last years planmore of the same it abandons the economic recovery and ends the medicare guarantee for individuals whose median income is under 21 000 while providing a whopping average tax break of almost 400 000 for people making over 1 million a year these tax breaks for the very wealthy and the tax breaks for special interests come at the expense of middleincome taxpayers at the expense of seniors and at the expense of essential investments to keep america strong this republican plan will weaken economic growth and according to independent analysts result in over 2 million jobs lost over the next 2 years it rewards corporations that ship american jobs overseas while slashing investments in education in scientific research and infrastructure that help america grow our economy right here at home in short it is a path to greater prosperity if you are already wealthy while leaving seniors working americans and future generations behind we gather here at a very important time for our country as a result of the extraordinary actions taken over the last 4 years and the tenacity of the american people and small businesses america avoided a second great depression and the economy is slowly recovering still millions of americans remain out of work through no fault of their own we must push forward with the recovery not fall back and we certainly should not return to the failed economic policies that got america into this economic mess to begin with and yet that is exactly what this republican budget does it is a recipe for national stagnation and decline it retreats from our national goal of outeducating outbuilding and outcompeting the rest of the world and it will weaken the economic recovery by slashing investments to important economic growth and expanding those tax breaks that reward corporations that ship american jobs overseas even when we have 17 percent unemployment in the construction industry it cuts critical investments in our transportation systems including a 46 percent cut in transportation starting next year as i mentioned earlier nonpartisan analysts looked at this and concluded it would lose 2 million jobs over 2 years so rather than putting the economy into reverse we need to move forward we need to adopt the remainder of the presidents jobs plan a plan thats been sitting here in the house since september its also clear that putting america back to work is the fastest and most effective way to reduce deficits in the short term in fact the congressional budget office estimates that our weak economy and underemployment is the single major contributing factor to the deficit this year accounting for over onethird of the projected 2012 deficit so we need to come up with a credible plan the issue as i said is not whether but how every bipartisan group that has looked at ways to reduce the deficit in a credible way has recommended a balanced approach meaning a combination of spending cuts and cuts to tax breaks for the wealthy and the elimination of special interest corporate tax loopholes the democratic alternative provides that balanced approach while the republican plan unfortunately fails that test instead their plan would again rig the rules in favor of the very wealthy and special interests that may not be a surprise since virtually every house republican has signed a pledgea pledgeto grover norquist saying they will not close a single special interest tax loophole not eliminate a single oil subsidy for the purpose of deficit reduction not one penny i agree with the gentleman from wisconsin that we face a real deficit and debt problem apparently the problem is not big enough to ask folks at the very high end of the income scale to contribute one penny toward deficit reduction in addition to locking in those parts of the bush tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the very wealthy they now have a new round of tax cuts that will provide on average a 400 000 tax cut for people making over 1 million a year thats according to the nonpartisan tax policy center so heres the key because our republican colleagues refuse to ask millionaires to contribute 1 cent to deficit reduction they hit everyone and everything else lets take a look at medicare recipients they immediately increase costs to seniors for medicare preventive services and terminate a new service the wellness programs that were part of the affordable care act they immediately reduce support to seniors in the prescription drug plan by reopening the doughnut hole that decision will cost seniors with high drug costs an average of 10 000 over the next 10 years once again this republican budget does not reform medicare it deforms it it proposes to end the medicare guarantee shifting rising costs onto seniors and disabled individuals it gives you the equivalent of a voucher but if your voucher amount is not sufficient to pay for the rising cost of health care too bad too bad it simply rations your health care and choice of doctor by income and leaves seniors to the whims of the insurance industry despite claims that market competition is going to bring down those rising costs the plan creates that artificial cap on the voucher support our republican colleagues say theyre using the part d prescription drug plan as a model but that has no artificial cap they say its the same kind of plan offered to members of congress under the federal employee health benefit plan but that has no cap on support from their plans so unlike members of congress seniors in medicare will get vouchers with declining purchasing power relative to rising health care costs in fact if you look at this chart you will see what the current medicare plan would provide in terms of the amount of support provided by the plan to the individual on health care thats the blue line this is the green line federal employee health benefit plan the plan that members of congress are on as you can see the amount of the premium support keeps pace with rising health care costs this red line is the republican voucher plan that caps the amount an individual can receive and goes steadily downward giving seniors on medicare a worse deal than members of congress would give to themselves now this budget also rips apart the safety net for seniors in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as lowincome kids and individuals with disabilities who rely on medicaid remember twothirds of medicaid funding goes to seniors in nursing homes and disabled individuals yet that is one of the biggest areas of the republican budget cuts it takes a hatchet to medicaid slashing over 800 billion and cutting medicaid by onethird by the year 2022 this is done under the orwellian title in their plan of repairing the social safety net thats like throwing an anchor to a drowning person to govern is to choose and thats what this debate is all about the choices in this republican budget are simply wrong for america it is not bold to provide tax breaks to millionaires while ending the medicare guarantee for seniors and sticking them with the bill for rising health care costs its not courageous to protect tax giveaways to big oil companies and other special interests while slashing investments in our kids education scientific research and critical infrastructure it is not visionary to reward corporations that ship american jobs overseas while terminating affordable health care for tens of millions of americans it is certainly not brave to cut support for seniors in nursing homes individuals with disabilities and poor kids and it is not fair to raise taxes on middleincome americans financed by another round of tax breaks for the very wealthy yet those are the choices made in this republican budget where is the shared responsibility we can and we must do better lets reject this budget and adopt the democratic alternative which provides a balanced approach to accomplishing the goal of reducing our deficits while at the same time strengthening our economy and doing it in a way that calls for shared responsibility i reserve

the economic crisis remains a daily reality for the 13 3 million unemployed workers and for the millions of americans experiencing record levels of food insecurity poverty and foreclosure whereas the national unemployment rate is 8 6 percent with over 42 8 percent of all unemployed workers more than 5 7 million people having been out of work for more than 6 months whereas while there were 1 8 unemployed americans for every job opening in december 2007 when the great recession began data recently released by the department of labor show that as of october 2011 there were over 4 3 unemployed americans for every job opening whereas data recently released by the department of labor show that as of october 2011 there were 3 3 million job openings which is well below the 4 8 million job openings in march 2007 when job openings were at their highest point during the most recent business cycle whereas recent data demonstrate that most unemployed americans no longer receive unemployment insurance benefits reflecting the crisis that exists for the millions of americans who have exhausted their benefits and still cannot find work including the 100 000 illinoisans estimated to have exhausted their benefits in 2010 and the additional 100 000 illinoisans who it is estimated would exhaust their benefits in 2012 if current law were extended whereas unemployment benefits are a critical lifeline for our citizens and our economy including by keeping 3 2 million americans including nearly 1 million children from falling into poverty in 2010 alone generating 2 in economic stimulus for every 1 the federal government spent during this recession and saving or creating 1 1 million jobs as of the fourth quarter of 2009 alone whereas all members of the house of representatives have a responsibility to protect americans and our country from physical and economic harm especially during times of national crisis whereas the recentlyintroduced republican proposal to address the unemployment crisis facing our nation fails to protect americans by drastically cutting 40 weeks of unemployment assistance and imposing new restrictions that would make it more difficult and costly for employees to receive the benefits for which they have paid whereas the republican proposal fails to protect americans by cutting the number of federallyfunded weeks of unemployment benefits from 73 to 33 in high unemployment states abandoning over 1 million americans in 2012 by slashing their benefits whereas the republican proposal would likely result in the following states with elevated unemployment rates losing 40 weeks of unemployment benefits in 2012 alabama california connecticut the district of columbia florida georgia illinois idaho indiana kentucky michigan mis souri nevada new jersey north carolina ohio oregon rhode island south carolina tennessee texas and washington whereas the republican proposal would cause all other states to lose between 14 and 34 weeks of federal unemployment benefits whereas the republican proposal would erode the unemployment safety net by undermining the requirement that unemployment dollars fund unemployment benefits to help individual workers cover basic necessities such as food and housing whereas the republican proposal would further erode the unemployment safety net by undermining the eligibility standard that unemployment benefits be determined solely on the basis of a claimants unemployment whereas the republican proposal demands untested punitive measures that hurt unemployed workers including deducting money from ones unemployment check to pay for required reemployment assessments and delayed or prohibited benefits depending on educational attainment whereas the republican proposal would disproportionately harm groups of americans who are hardest hit by unemployment and longterm unemployment including older americans lowincome americans americans from racial and ethnic minority groups and americans without a high school diploma whereas now that emergency assistance is about to expire the republican proposal reflects comfort with 180 billion in tax breaks for the wealthiest 3 percent of americans for 2012 but not the 50 billion needed to help millions of the neediest americans who still cannot find a job whereas the economic policy institute estimates that the republican proposal would result in as much as 22 billion in lost economic growth and the center for american progress estimates that the republican proposal would lead to a loss of approximately 275 000 jobs in 2012 whereas it will tarnish the dignity and integrity of the house proceedings if the house considers a bill that cuts critical emergency assistance to millions of americans hinders economic recovery and disproportionately harms older americans americans from racial and ethnic minority groups lowincome americans and americans without a high school degree whereas it will tarnish the dignity and integrity of the house proceedings if the republican leadership holds hostage the 2 5 million americans who the department of labor estimates will lose their benefits by march 2012 if congress fails to act in order to push a radical agenda the american people have already rejected and whereas failure to allow consideration of amendments to protect vulnerable americans during consideration of a bill that substantially and permanently changes federal unemployment benefits tarnishes the integrity of the legislative process now therefore be it resolved that the house of representatives 1 recognizes the immediate need to extend current emergency unemployment benefits to promote our nations economic recovery by stimulating purchases creating jobs and preventing the loss of jobs 2 recognizes the immediate need to extend current emergency unemployment benefits to help the approximately 6 million unemployed americans who will lose benefits if current emergency unemployment benefits are not extended through 2012 3 disapproves of drastically limiting federal unemployment benefits until economic growth is robust and the nation is in a period of full employment and 4 calls on the leadership of the house to bring to a vote a clean extension of all current emergency unemployment benefits for a full year to protect the millions of americans who will lose benefits if the current statute sunsets at the end of december 2011 or if h r 3630 as posted by the committee on rules on december 9 2011 is enacted"], [0.0004687309265136719, 0.9995312690734863,

austerity for who the fact is that in recent years weve been condemning more and more americans to austerity then ever before while at the same time we continue to hand out tax breaks and fat government contracts for the wealthiest americans and the largest and wealthiest corporations after getting bailed out the profits at the largest financial institutions have recovered and then somebonuses for their ceos have recovered and then some but this congress refuses to ask those institutions and those ceos and others like them to give back just a little the latest census data dramatically shows how after african americans had made significant gains in the 1950s and 60s progress began to stall in the 1970s four decades after the civil rights movement blacks still earn only 57 cents and latinos earn 59 cents for each 1 of white median family income in our country the contrast is even starker for net worth that is the total value of investments savings homes and other property minus debt blacks hold only 10 cents of net wealth and latinos 12 cents for every 1 that whites hold out of the 43 6 million americans living below the poverty threshold 9 9 million of those are african americans meanwhile the latest unemployment rates are to say the least grim overall african american unemployment 16 2 percent african american men 17 percent black teenagers about 40 percentand this congress cant find the votes to extend unemployment insurance i say that our policies must reflect the needs of those who are most vulnerable we must provide opportunity for the needy and not just the greedy when i see that the median annual social security benefit for a 65yearold single african american woman is 10 680 which puts the median benefit for african american woman seniors just above the 2010 poverty line for individual seniors an obscenely low 10 458 and when i couple that with the knowledge that nearly half45 6 percentof nonmarried african american women aged 65 older rely on social security for all of their income and 54 1 percent rely on it for 90 percent of their income or more and worst of all when i recall that nonmarried african american women seniors already suffer from high rates of poverty and nearpoverty nearly half47 8 percentof african american women living alone have an income under 125 percent of poverty and onethird33 percenthave income below 100 percent of the poverty line well i just have to say to those who are talking of reducing social security benefits or the annual social security colas or raising the age for collecting social security austerity for who when i pick up the paper every morning and have to read over and over that home foreclosures were twoandahalf times above the 2001 rate by the end of 2010 and that some 3 7 million homes are in danger of foreclosure and this congress instead of addressing the epidemics of unemployment and foreclosure plays politics with raising the debt ceiling i cant help but remember that for all the hubbub about the size of government and federal spending the bush tax cuts increased the deficit by 1 7 trillion between 2001 and 2008 and the two wars begun by president bush added another 1 trillion to the deficit and bush administrations policy of deregulation of the financial markets led ultimately to the bursting of the housing bubble which triggered the great recession which not only sapped our federal budget but have decimated state and local budgets in every corner of the nation i have to demand of those risking default and tipping the nation into depression austerity for who i have to wonder why we arent talking about the fact that since the recession officially ended in june 2009 private payrolls have increased by more than 1 million workers still nowhere close to putting 14 million americans back to work but state and local government payrolls for teachers firefighters police officers public health workers and other critical services have declined by 493 000cutting the number of jobs created almost in half while the loss of those good jobs reverberate throughout the local economies my obvious question is austerity for who i wonder if some members of congress just dont know that medicaid covered half of all black children in the united states and nearly twothirds 64 of lowincome black children medicaid covers over a third 35 of african americans in fair or poor health and 59 of african americans living with hiv aids shouldnt we expect and require of those who are proposing to slash medicaid an answer to austerity for who i am just as concerned about balancing the federal budget as any member of this congress but there are a lot of ways to do that the peoples budget proposed by the progressive caucus would get us to a balanced budget and would put us on the road to paying down the debt and lay the foundation for a healthy sustainable and just economy ive reached the conclusion that we do need a constitutional amendment not a balanced budget amendment but one that would require members of congress who glibly propose austerity as a quick and dirty solution to every challenge which comes over the horizon to

ruleand not only restrictive but a very convoluted ruleand i rise in opposition to the three bills that would be made in order by this rule regulatory uncertainty is a canard invented by republicans that allows them to use current economic problems to pursue an agenda supported by the big business community year in and year out in other words it is a simple case of political opportunism not a serious effort to deal with high unemployment those arent my words those are the words of bruce bartlett a republican who worked for ronald reagan george h w bush jack kemp and ron paul think about what mr bartlett is saying in his last sentence republicans would rather play political games instead of putting people back to work they would rather fiddle while rome burns instead of putting out the fire and look at the republican track record since the start of the 112th congress no jobs bills not one but weve found time to debate bills defunding planned parenthood and national public radio theres no extension of the payroll tax cut or unemployment insurance but we can spend hours debating the need to allow unsafe people the right to carry concealed weapons from state to state no effort to take away tax breaks for oil companies who continue to make billions of dollars in profits each month but we can find time to make our air dirtier and our water less safe by dismantling the clean air act and the clean water act seriously the agenda of the far right continues to dominate this house leadership and that agenda is out of touch with the needs of the american people we have a jobs crisis in this country the rich are getting richer and everyone else is struggling yet the republicans continue to side with the people who dont need any help they killed the supercommittee because they would rather protect tax cuts for millionaires instead of dealing with the deficit they are refusing to take up the extension of the payroll tax cut that expires at the end of the year because they dont want their millionaire friends to pay just a little bit more just look at what were doing this week were going to consider antiregulatory bills that will make our country less safe and our citizens less healthy were going to consider a bill that actually promotes putting more corporate money into the political system and were going to debate a bill that makes it harder for workers to organize not one of these bills will put people back to work not one of these bills will help struggling families keep their heat on during the winter not one of these bills will help repair our aging infrastructure to quote mr bartlett again people are increasingly concerned about unemployment but republicans have nothing to offer them and thats the truth republicans have absolutely nothing to offer the president proposedand i have cosponsoredthe american jobs act its a proposal that would help put americans back to work would extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance would help repair our aging infrastructure and would provide aid to cities and states so they dont have to lay off more teachers and more police officers and more firefighters its a bill that is paid for it doesnt add one cent to the deficit and its made up of measures that republicans and democrats have supported in the past let me repeat that what the president has proposed is a series of measures that republicans and democrats have supported in the past the idea that a program was good under president bush but not under president obama doesnt make much sense to me but that seems to be the thought process that passes for governing under this republican leadership so wheres the republican plan they dont have one its not enough to cross our fingers and hope that our economy improves its not enough to close our eyes and wish that more people would find a job actions speak louder than words and it is clear by the republican leaderships actions that they dont care about the economy either that or they are making a conscious decision not to act simply for political gain either way americans are hurting because of their inaction our economy is not where it needs to be there are still too many unemployed people in this country there are still too many people struggling to make ends meet struggling to pay their bills and to put food on the table but this notion that red tape is whats keeping our economy from getting off the ground and that thoughtful regulations are preventing people from getting jobs is just untrue we dont need to waste time debating bills that make our air and water dirtier and less safe we dont need to waste our time with bills defunding npr and planned parenthood we dont need to waste our time debating bills to reaffirm our national motto what we need to do is to get this economy moving what we need to do is create jobs republicans have been in charge now for 330 days thats 330 days without a jobs bill its not enough to call something a jobs bill if it doesnt put someone back to work no we need a real jobs bill we need definitive action that shows the american people that we care about their wellbeing that we understand what theyre going through and that were here to helpin short that were on their side the bills we will be considering this week just dont get the job done its been 330 days and republicans still dont get it i cant say that im

month this is such an important time for this discussion i also thank you congresswoman christensen for your visionary and bold leadership as you continue to make history truly you have done remarkable work here in this body it is really especially poignant that this year during black history month the republican leadership has proposed a budget for fiscal year 2011 that will fall most heavily on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society african americans latinos and the poor those who have been shut out of the american dream at a time when we should be remembering and uplifting the accomplishments and contributions of african americans to the history culture civil rights and economy of america we are literally during this month debating steps that will severely undercut and undermine that legacy can we cut nearly 750 million from the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program while we have a record high unemployment rate throughout our country but especially among african americans we cant do that the unemployment rate among african americans is over 15 percent many african american women rely on wic while they seek jobs which we are trying to hopefully create how can we cut 317 million in funding for vital family planning health services provided through a network of clinics throughout the country that serves nearly one in five women these programs are vital not just in saving lives through cancer screening hiv and std testing and contraceptive services but for providing a link for the many poor and lowincome women in terms of their link to the public health system many of these women are african american women and how can we cut nearly 1 1 billion from the head start program which will effectively knock out 200 000 children from participating in this critical early education program which helps provide health nutritional and support services to prepare children for school many african americans who were part of the head start program are now making history in our country because of this great early childhood education program the other side has made it clear that no matter who is impacted by these cutswomen infants children the working poor people of color african americanstheir response consists of only three words so be it so be it if 800 000 jobs are lost so be it if people are put out on the street with no access to homeless assistance grants or temporary housing so be it if people dont get enough nutritional support or if kids have to go hungry so be it that is not what the civil rights movement was about we should be working together to build up a nation instead of tear down the very programs and institutions that have contributed to our nations growth and success we should be working together to reduce inequality help the unemployed and get our economy moving again above all we should be working to create jobs thats what so many prominent african american leaders have fought for over the yearsfrom those who are well known the world over like dr martin luther king jr to people who are sometimes well known just in their own neighborhood tonight there is one person i want to mention who influenced my life and the direction i took our late beloved former congresswoman shirley anita chisholm in 1968 congresswoman shirley chisholm was the first african american woman elected to congress and she was a founding member of the congressional black caucus we celebrate this year 40 years of this great institution in our congress the conscience of the congress it is the 42nd anniversary of the election of congresswoman chisholm who represented her brooklynbased congressional district with grace and distinction for 14 years earning a reputation as one of the houses most eloquent orators and greatest champions of human rights social and economic justice in 1972 congresswoman chisholm again made history when she became the first african american to run for the presidential nomination of a major party that campaign captured the imagination of millions and inspired countless individuals to engage in the political process for the first time and i know for a fact that congresswoman shirley chisholm paved the way for our great president obama to be able to win the presidency 2 years ago congresswoman chisholm was a catalyst for change giving voice to the overlooked and underrepresented members of our society people of color women children and the african american community and she fought for the unemployed she fought for those who wanted to work for those who were seeking the american dream i cant help but wonder what she would say right now if she knew this was taking place im sure she does know this is taking place and i can feel her telling us that we have to fight the good fight because her legacy is so important within the context of creating jobs that we are trying to do for our country later this week i will be introducing two pieces of legislation to honor the work of congresswoman shirley chisholm the first would recognize and celebrate the 42nd anniversary of her election to congress and the second would call on the postal service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the life and accomplishments of congresswoman chisholm i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these bills as we work to finalize funding for the 2011 fiscal year let us remember that budgets are moral documents and as congresswoman chisholm said when morality comes up against profit it is seldom that profit loses so we have to stand up for morality reverend jim wallis and sojourners challenged us they asked us what would jesus cut programs to help the poor or wasteful weapons systems at the pentagon ending the war in afghanistan or programs to feed and shelter the poor this weekend once again i will be participating in the faith and politics civil rights pilgrimage we are going to selma montgomery and birmingham alabama the epicenter of the civil rights movement we will be led by our hero a warrior a great civil rights leader our colleague congressman john lewis who sacrificed so much for civil and human rights and economic justice i have participated in this pilgrimage many times and i always feel a sense of gratitude to congressman lewis and to rosa parks and to dr king to shirley chisholm to all of those who fought so hard for equality and jobs and freedom this year however i feel that many of these gains mind you that all of our great civil rights leaders fought for are about to be eroded due to the increasing income inequality and the reckless budget cuts which will gut so much in the way of our countrys response to the civil rights movement so as republicans fight us so hard to enact budget cuts that will destroy nearly 800 000 jobs be assured that in honoring the legacy of our great black leaders we will fight back thank you"]], "top_incorrect":

black caucus budget came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but its important to note that the name of our budget reflects the reality of our budget and the reality of our budget is that we want to see rich poor and everybody in the middle do well in america that means a budget for all as i begin to wind down i just want to say that it is an honor to come before you to talk about the budget for all but its also an honor to talk about the ryan republican budget because the ryan republican budget offers a very different vision of america than the budget for all the ryan vision says that if we just could get rich people more money they might create some plants and equipment that will hire the rest of us the budget for all says no were in this together and were going to ask the wealthiest to pay more to invest in health education transportation and infrastructure so that we can have a stronger better greater america two visions of a nation one says austerity for the middle and working class and the poor and one says investment one says if you are out of luck youre on your own and one says as americans were all in this together i want to thank you for allowing me to be here and offer these contrasts these choices for americans as we close

even though they are under 26 years old bravo for you but thats not the way it is for many young people across the country even if they do have a job you say they dont have insurance because they dont have a job it may be news to you but there are many many many working americans who do not have health insurance but they will under the affordable care act if this amendment were to pass if it were to become law immediately all of those children who can now be on their parents policy if their parents are willing would lose their health insurance with a job or without a job these young people coming out of school are idealistic and ambitious they want to follow their passions and their pursuits that is what our founders told them they could dolife liberty and pursuit of happiness these young people want a healthier life to pursue their happiness to choose a job not based on the health benefits it may or may not provide but to choose an occupation which addresses their aspirationsnot ours theirs so i just want to repeat back to our colleagues something i heard them say over and over again they said we didnt read the bill well we did but clearly you did not and i urge you to read the bill because if you did you would see that the bill puts medical decisions in the hands of patients and doctors not your favorite insurance company you would see that it brings down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors you would see that it ends the days of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage because you have to pay your medical bills so be it i urge my

best way to do that is job creation we know that if we want to talk about what happened in the nineties we have to reference the fact that under president bill clinton the reaganbush deficit that he inherited he turned around and five of his last budgets the clinton budgets were in balance or were in surplus he put us on a trajectory he and the growth of jobs in our country in the public and largely in the private sector took us to a path a trajectory of 5 6 trillion in surplus along comes president george w bush and in record time he reversed that it was the biggest fiscal turnaround in our nations history taking us to a trajectory of over 5 trillion in deficit an 11 trillion turnaround two unpaidfor wars said the cbo the nonpartisan congressional budget office that was because of two unpaidfor wars the bush tax cuts particularly at the high end which did not create jobs and a giveaway pharmaceutical bill to the pharmaceutical industry those were the three main reasons for the big fiscal turnaround and how we got deeply in debt i dont remember a lot of complaints coming from the republican side of the aisle while president bush was taking us down this path mr goodlatte referenced two paths well this is one path that president bush took us down so now we have to deal with that because the deficit is a concern to all of us we believe that the best way to deal with that is what president clinton did which was to have a great economic agenda to generate jobs yet here we are nearly 320 days into the republican majority and they have taken no action on any serious jobcreating bills here we go again debating legislation that will not create jobs in fact according to experts the enactment of this proposed amendment to our constitution would destroy 15 million jobs double the unemployment rate and cause the economy to shrink by 17 percent as bruce bartlett said recently former economic adviser to president ronald reagan and to president george herbert walker bush even if we were not in an economic crisis and fighting two wars a rapid cut in spending of that magnitude would unquestionably throw the economy into recession just as it did in 1937 this legislation is an attack on our economy and it is an attack on our seniors according to the nonpartisan center on budget and policy priorities it could result in cuts over 10 years of 750 billion to medicare and 1 2 trillion in cuts to social security these cuts would be devastating to the 40 million seniors who rely on medicare and social security every day they are even more draconian than the cuts in the republican budget which would effectively repeal the medicare guarantee and just one week after our nation celebrated veterans day we are debating potentially cutting 85 billion over the next 10 years from veterans benefits my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim this is a clean balanced budget amendment it is not because this proposed amendment to our constitution will require a supermajority in both chambers of congress to raise the debt limit it puts the full faith and credit of the united states of america in the hands of a minoritythis after we went through all of the stress and strain and uncertainty and downgrading of our credit rating when we couldnt even get a majority and now were thinking of a supermajority vote for the debt limit increase again that was never a requirement when president bush was president that there would be a supermajority to raise the debt limit this amendment promotes further brinkmanship and uncertainty enshrining extreme ideology into the constitution at a time when americans have been very clear that they expect us to set differences aside and to get to work it is our duty as members of congressindeed we take the oath of officeto be the elected guardians of our constitution to protect and defend it and to do no harm to our founding documents yet if this proposed amendment is adopted it will have farreaching and adverse consequences i repeat that it was a democratic president president clinton who balanced the budget in the nineties five of his budgets were in balance or in surplus we can do it again without harming our constitution our economy our seniors or our veterans we must start by creating jobs and strengthening our economic growtha key to reducing the deficit it was interesting to me to hear others on the other side of the aisle talk about our children and our responsibility to them yes thats what we said when president bush was amassing his deficit but i didnt hear anyone on the other side of the aisle talking about that this is about our constitution we owe it to the vision of our founders to the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and to the aspirations of our children to get our economic and fiscal houses in order this is the exact wrong way to do it we must reignite the american dream and we have work to do on that so lets get to work to create jobs so

differences in the fisheries i guarantee you that the fishermen in my state would say this is not to circumvent the law this is a law that is now working in our state and highly successful this amendment would block the use of catch shares from managing our nations fisheries by superseding the regional fishery management council process set up by congress i live in the heart of a district where people have lost a tremendous amount of fish and are looking for ways to make sure that they have a fisheries industry to pass along to their children and grandchildren the sectors management system in maine has done that it has allowed innovative fishermen like members of the maine coast fishermens association to manage their small business in a way that works best for them in their own way of managing it by having an allocation and the flexibility to fish on their own schedulewhich i can tell you is far safer and far more profitablefishermen can enter into contracts with processors and avoid the race to fish improving their bottom line and their safety and its been proven over and over again some maine fishermen have even developed communitysupported fisheries coops which bring local fish to the tables of local consumers strengthening our communities while getting fishermen a better price for their catch it is critical for coastal communities and working waterfronts that fishermen are allowed to utilize the best management tools for their particular fishery catch shares may not be the best option for every fishery but that decision should be left to the industry the management experts and the scientists in their region where the fishery occurs in order to help our fishermen we should be focused on improving the stock assessments implementing cooperative research

the boiler mact rule that was proposed by epa in april of 2010 and finalized in february of 2011 many of us here know that when the boiler mact regulation was finalized epa asked for 15 months to issue a reproposal the courts rejected that request and thus epa was forced to issue the rule on time in february of 2011 however epa immediately instituted an administrative stay on several major rules within the regulation saying that they would begin reconsideration with new information that had been made available in the last few months ive met with many industries and companies that expressed concern with the provisions in this final rule ive listened and even helped foster ongoing conversations between those industries and epa as they worked toward a reproposal of the boiler mact rule then we were offered this bill the epa regulatory relief act we were told that this bill would simply give epa the time that they had already asked for to work on the rule and repropose a new final rule after the conversations i had had with companies in my district i thought this would be a good solution the problem is when you dig a little deeper ive said for a long time this epa boiler mact rule is far from perfect but the trouble is the bill we have before us today is even further from perfect because it doesnt just give epa time to reconsider the rule it tells epa they cant issue a new rule for at least 15 months but theres no deadline for final action further it practically rewrites sections 112 and 129 of the clean air act by eliminating the need for numeric emission limits for mact standards but perhaps the most egregious to me was section 3 of the bill it once again rewrites the clean air act the clean air act provides for 3 years for compliance with mact standards with the possibility of a 4th section 3 of this bill tells us to throw that out it tells us that for the boiler mact rule compliance cannot be required for at least 5 years however it then says to the epa administrator it gives the administrator the ability to establish compliance dates so depending on who the administrator is at the time these rules are finalized compliance could be required in 5 years in 10 years in 50 years in 105 years thats just unacceptable and thats why im offering this amendment today i support many of the things in this bill and i recognize the need for a reproposal of this rule but i dont support 5 years to infinity for compliance and so this amendment will simply require that we go back to the established compliance time lines in the clean air act it even gives the possibility for an additional year of compliance if a compelling reason is found i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and make this a bill that we can all support when it

diminishes safety that is not a formula for a good transportation billless safety fewer jobs losing jobs and so we have an opportunity to support a bipartisan bill that has come from the senate threequarters of the senate in a bipartisan way passed it out march 31 is the deadline when all of this will expire unless congress acts and congress is not acting because the republican majority does not have its act together their our way or the highway attitude means no highway bill that creates jobs and promotes public safety its really so sad because in the tradition of our country from the start from the very start thomas jefferson understood the need for building the infrastructure of america he tasked his secretary of the treasury gallatin to come up with a project that would expand into america the louisiana purchase and the lewis and clark expeditions and out of that initiative came the cumberland road the erie canal and other things like that over time and in that tradition the transcontinental railroad and the rest that would come later then in our century a republican president president eisenhower at a time of bad economic times bad economic times he went forward and took the initiative for the interstate highway initiative which was so important to our country it was a security issue to unite america it was a jobs initiative to build that interstate highway system and it was about promoting commerce connecting people and improving the quality of life it was a great initiative and it too was a bipartisan initiative in fact in the senate our friend senator gore vice president gore his father took the lead on that legislation the distinguished gentleman from tennessee as we heard earlier from the gentlemen from tennessee so this has all been a bipartisan initiative its about rebuilding america which is part of our reigniting the american dream to build ladders of opportunities so people who work hard play by the rules and take responsibility can have a ladder of success to climb and then put down for others to do and part of that is a make it in america so that people can make it in america and b and i get to this point build america build america build the infrastructure of america and that means everything from the highways with mass transit rapid transit highspeed rail and all kinds of technological infrastructure that we need with broadband

have a challenge the authorization expires march 31 we have a bill that can be sent to the president in a matter of hours from this house of representatives this day and instead of smoothing the way the road to jobs we have the republicans putting up yet again another obstacle because they have not been able to get unity in their caucus on a bill that promotes commerce builds america promotes safety and creates jobs jobs jobs jobs so what are we doing wasting the publics time with a 60day extension i support the leadership of our ranking member mr rahall when he talks about why we have to do something better something more important something more worthy of the concerns of the american people than a parliamentary maneuver that isnt going to produce anything it doesnt even have anything attached to it that says lets do this now so that we can do something better later it has a bill that they cannot even pass on the house floor their own h r 7 if they could pass that they would their own caucus doesnt support what theyre putting forth so they expect the rest of us to cover for them well that is a real disservice to the american people it is a real disservice to the hundreds of thousands of construction workers who are out of work this job in its totality and the jobs it would save and the jobs it would create over 2 million jobs and yet instead of doing that we have a tactical maneuver for god knows what reason everything we do is about time its about time shortening the time in which people have to wait for jobs shortening the times in which people get to and from

few thousand beyond that are actually engaged in manufacturing in america today so what happened to the 9 million they lost their jobs those jobs disappeared not from the earth but disappeared from america they went overseas they were outsourced american jobs were outsourced why well theyd like to say its simply the nature of the free market system and indeed thats part of it but thats not all of it a major part of it had to do with specific tax policies and other manufacturing industrial policies that were enacted by congress and remained on the books for some 20 years or more we need to address that issue because if in fact it is the policies of this congress and previous congresses that have led to the great outsourcing and decline of the american manufacturing sector and along with it the american middle class then theres something that we can do about it we make laws we establish policies and if we find that there are policies that are contrary to the good ability of the american economy to prosper and the middle class to prosper along with it then we ought to change those policies thats what the make it in america agenda is all about the make it in america agenda is specifically designed to rebuild the american manufacturing sector this is an issue thats been taken up by the democratic caucus led by our minority whip mr hoyer and carried on by my colleagues and i so were going to talk a little bit about that i notice that my colleague from new york has joined us mr tonko we were going to start out on health care but we kind of morphed into the issue of the american manufacturing industry and the role of the middle class now the middle class i went off on manufacturing and the need to rebuild that and the make it in america agenda but also a key part of the inability of the american middle class to sustain itself is health care and the affordable health care act which the supreme court recently confirmed was constitutional is constitutional is a major effort on the part of the democratic congress and president obama to provide not only health care but to lift up the american middle class so lets hold for a moment the issue of make it in america well come back to it in the latter half of this hour but lets take up the health care agenda which i know you wanted to speak to initially while youre doing that im going to run and get a couple of placards that show what it is were talking about please mr tonko from the great state of new york part of the eastwest team"], [0.9960563057102263, 0.003943694289773703, 1, "i also ask

hartzler for leading this important effort tonight to highlight the concern that republican women have for the millions of seniors that we represent in congress and yes i do come from a little community in western north carolina thats called grandfather community because there is a mountain there called grandfather mountain thats one of the highest mountains east of the rockies its the second highest mountain east of the rockies and i have to tell you when people come and see the beautiful view i have and say how can you leave this to go to washington i tell them it isnt easy but i think that were doing important work here and its important that we continue to do this work and represent i think the majority of the people in this country i think highlighting this is very important and its interesting my colleague from north carolina who just spoke congresswoman ellmers and i did not exchange notes but we both were on the same wavelength in terms of what we wanted to talk about i read my own mail i answer all my own letters and im astounded at the number of letters i get from seniors who tell me theyre very concerned about the health of the medicare and social security programs they are concerned and theyve been misled into thinking that republicans want to do something negative to those programs it is amazing the misinformation thats out there about republicans and our attitude toward medicare and social security in fact its republicans who have a plan to save medicare and social security and thats what i tell seniors but theyve heard that the congressional budget office has projected that medicare part a would be bankrupt in 10 years and they know theyve paid into these programs and theyre relying on them to provide critical medical care for them when they need it in the past congresses have taken a pass on reforming these programs to keep them solvent for both todays seniors as well as for future generations who are currently paying into them like we are but the house republican path to prosperity budget plan provides a way forward it ensures that medicare lives long past 2020 when its now projected to be bankrupt the republican plan as my colleague from north carolina said does nothing to impact medicare benefits for anyone 55 or older but it will improve the program so that those 54 and younger will have access to the same kind of health care program enjoyed by federal employees and members of congress were often criticized for having a separate program but this will allow the seniors to participate in the same kind of program that we participate in its far better than letting the program wither on the vine which is what those who refuse to take action would allow to happen and again as my colleague pointed out its our friends on the other side of the aisle who voted to cut a half trillion dollars from medicare not a single republican voted to do that our effort has always been to save medicare to save social security and we have the plan to do it the path to prosperity budget and its plan to save medicare its the only plan that preserves medicare for todays seniors and for future generations i think this
