congressman payne have a oneup on me so thank you so much i really appreciate it as we continue our conversation on accountability equality and diversity i would like to offer some statistics on our economy 50 years ago and today with respect to the african american community and women in 1965 african american jobseekers could be denied employment based on the color of their skin and when they could find jobs they were disproportionately paid less than white males in the same position in fact in 1965 the black unemployment rate was 8 1 percent almost twice the national unemployment rate which stood at 4 5 percent fifty years later we have made great strides and our nations workforce is more diverse than ever but we have much more work to do today at 10 4 percent the black unemployment rate is still almost double the national unemployment rate of 5 6 percent while it is significantly smaller there is still a racial wage gap the median african american household has less than twothirds the income of the average white median household in the past year we have seen the greatest economic growth in decades more and more women have been able to enter the workforce reducing the employment rate among women to a 6year low unfortunately black women have yet to reap the benefits of the economic rebound in fact while the overall unemployment rate for women declined the black female unemployment rate has increased over the past 2 months according to a recent analysis by the national womens law center the black womens unemployment rate is more than twice the unemployment rate of white women despite having comparable levels of education black women have had the highest unemployment rate of any other group a possible factor in the stubborn unemployment rate for black women is that we are disproportionately employed in the public sector which is experiencing a much slower recovery than the private sector nwlc said the stagnant job situation for black women is a red flag in the employment landscape and urged lawmakers to act to promote a stronger more widely shared recovery i couldnt agree more we need to invest more in job training and retraining programs that help black women adapt to the changing workforce and prepare for the careers of tomorrow we must work to promote diversity in hiring and encourage employers to model their workforces on the communities in which they operate as we look for ways to help increase diversity in the workplace and help women succeed we must be mindful of the unique challenges black women face and develop targeted policies that help level the playing field for all women these facts i have just covered point to the systemic problems we need to address them today it should be our mission today to see to it that in 50 years when lawmakers stand here they will proudly be touting the progress our nation has made because all americans are paid equally and no is discriminated against in the workplace as chair of the congressional black caucus health braintrust i am working to address our nations health equity gap by exploring legislative and policy initiatives to reduce minority health disparities and promote better health outcomes for all americans with respect to the african american community the health disparity gap is particularly wide as blacks have high rates of many adverse health conditions across the medical spectrumfrom cancer to diabetes from hypertension to strokeblacks are overrepresented and often undertreated a major barrier to african americans getting the medical care they need is the lack of african american doctors in their communities studies show that african americans are more comfortable seeking treatment from doctors who look like them and are much more likely to adhere to courses of treatment prescribed by black doctors yet while african americans comprise 13 percent of the unitedstates population we represent only 4 percent of the physician workforce according to the association of american medical colleges 2014 diversity in the physician workforce report the infamous tuskegee study fostered an enduring legacy of mistrust of the medical establishment in the african american community that makes diversity in medicine vital to closing the health disparities gap in order to achieve health equity we must work to create a physician workforce that reflects our nation one key way to do that is to encourage more african americans to pursue education and training in science technology engineering and math congress must do more to support investments in stem education and to create avenues of access for african american students to enter the stem fields in my district i launched the second congressional district stem academy to expose students to stem fields in hopes of encouraging them to pursue stemrelated careers also a stem workforce made up of diverse ranks is crucial to future innovation to help in that mission folks across the country and in silicon valley have taken note i know facebook has sought to change the face of innovation through efforts like their facebook academy and facebook university which target high school and college students from underrepresented groups similar to my stem academy it is good to see them making an effort to build a pipeline and introduce women and people of color to jobs in stemwhich of course could be it engineeringand hopefully more young people decide to become doctors and they can work in african american communities or underserved communities a medical student population that reflects our countrys population will create a pipeline of diverse doctors to our communities which will in turn put all americans on track to live a healthier life i turn back to my colleague from new jersey congressman donald payne"], [4.410743713378906e-05, 0.9999558925628662, 1, "i first thank the gentlewoman from ohio for those very kind and humbling remarks i want to thank her for her tremendous leadership and for continuing to come down here each and every week to ensure that her voice the congressional black caucus voice and congressman jeffries voice are really put forth so that the people of our country will understand the critical issues before us and the fact that the congressional black caucus is really leading on each and every issue congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries really have done a phenomenal job they both have gone way beyond the call of duty and so we thank them so much for their efforts make no mistakeand i think we are hearing this over and over again tonightmass incarceration is a crisis in our country the united states of america imprisons far more people than any other nation in the world when african americans are incarcerated at six times the rate of whites it is no surprise to me it is no surprise that african americans constitute nearly half of the total 2 3 million incarcerated americans in 2008 together african americans and latinos comprise 58 percent of all prisoners in 2008 even though african americans and latinos make up approximately onequarter of the united states population while our prison population grows unchecked and is growing unchecked we continue to criminalize our students rather than invest in their education right now we spend 10 500 a year to educate a child but we spend 88 000 a year to keep a child locked up that is unacceptable let me repeat that it costs eight times more money to keep a child in jail than to educate them and prepare them for a good future we are not just talking about a few children here our country incarcerates five times more children than any other nation in the world sadly twothirds of these kids will never return to school when we lock up these children we are essentially throwing away the key instead of preparing them for a future we are just getting them ready for a life in a cell now let me be clear from the moment many of these children are born they are funneled into the prison pipeline simply put the system is really stacked against them for instance one in three african american children lives in poverty today while one in four hispanic children lives in poverty while black children represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment they account for nearly half of all preschool suspensions now congresswoman beatty we are talking toddlers ages 2 to 5 these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start they are being suspended from school how do you suspend toddlers and babies from school something is wrong with this so we i must say in the appropriations committee are trying to address this with the department of education this is immoral when they get older african american students are four times more likely to be expelled from school than their white peers for the same offense more than half of all students who are involved in schoolrelated arrests or referred to law enforcement are black or latino this has a lasting effect and impact on young students studies show that students who are disciplined by schools are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system where their chances of returning to school are slim to none this is unacceptable these young people are having their futures ripped away before they even have a chance we need to change the system and end the schooltoprison pipeline first we must start by making serious investments in our young people we should ensure that all students have equal access to highquality public school education we must also expand summer youth job opportunities and summer training programs so that our teens have the opportunity to learn workforce skills contribute to their communities and start a path to economic opportunity as a member of the subcommittee on early childhood elementary and secondary education we are working to try to make sure that these resources become a priority of our subcommittee which they unfortunately arent at this point we also need to tear down the institutional racism quite frankly that is holding students of color back and trapping our young people in a broken criminal justice system i am reminded of when i was in the california legislature i was on the public safety committee and proposals were brought to us plans for building prisons 10 to 12 years out for kids who are just starting kindergarten that is what we had to deal with now we see what has happened to the prison industrial complex in california that is why we must work together and pass legislation to end mass incarceration and fix our broken criminal justice system we need to get rid of these outdated minimum sentencing standards these are relics from the failed war on drugs and disproportionately target people of color in california once again the three strikes law passed of course i opposed that while in the california legislature this law has incarcerated young african american men for nonviolent drug offenses 25 years to life that is 25 years to life for nonviolent drug offenses we need to repeal that law we also need to make sure that law enforcement officers reflect the diversity of communities that they police so we have introduced h res 262 which supports effective communityoriented policing and encourages greater diversity in law enforcement during the last appropriation season the congressional black caucus worked with congressman lacy clay to direct the department of justice to begin collecting training data our legislation tracks when officers receive training for use of force racial and ethnic bias deescalation of conflict and constructive engagement with the public this was just a small step and we need to do more with regard to reentry banning the box is essential we have worked with the white house to try to make sure that federal contractors ban the box we havent accomplished that but federal agencies cannot now ask for ones criminal history records in my district we do expungement we do record remedies we have remedied thousands and thousands of young people who now can go on and move forward with their lives i want to thank the family law center in oakland california for doing that we need to go back to the drawing board and repeal the welfare reform provisions that are denied for life there is a federal ban for food stamps eligibility for public housing and pell grants for those who have been incarcerated for drug felonies now you know who that targets primarily african american and latino men they dont even have a second chance when they get out of jail as a result of these lifetime bans finally let me just say it is time to really look at this problem in a big way and to understand that we have to dismantle not reformbut we have to dismantle this prison industrial complex and start investing in our communities especially our young children and we must understand that in doing this we have to look at institutional and systemic racism which is at the core of many of our policies so this is a fight that we are going to win but it is going to be because all of us here in the congressional black caucuscongresswoman beatty congressman jeffries congressman scott and congresswoman jackson lee and the entire membershipcontinue to fight the good fight to make sure that finally we will begin to see a real criminal justice system which it is not right now"], [4.4345855712890625e-05, 0.9999556541442871, 1, "i thank the gentleman for recognizing me i am really pleased to join the ranking member bobby scott a mentor of mine and a good friend marcia fudge and others about the reauthorization of school meals and the wic program they are truly champions for ending hunger among children in this country and i believe no conversation could occur about hunger without having the indomitable mr mcgovern with us this evening the child nutrition reauthorization is really a critical opportunity for us to talk about the importance of improving access to healthy meals in schools and for maintaining strong nutrition standards for too many kids the only sure meals that they can count on on any given day are provided in school yet unfortunately the majority on the other side of the aisle are talking about how to make it harder for children especially lowincome children who are eligible for free and reducedprice meals breakfast and lunch to access these programs we should be using this reauthorization to address known gaps and to help children connect to these healthy meals nearly 10 000 more schools offer school lunch than offer school breakfast programs and we should be trying to expand school breakfast rather than restricting them the healthy hungerfree act in the nationwide implementation of the community eligibility program was so insightful but yet we need to do more over 162 000 kids in my state qualify for free or reduced meals for lunch and we need to reach them now what does the reauthorization that republicans are bringing before us entail what does it talk about it talks about scaling back the successful and proven community eligibility provision which we just implemented nationwide last year and really havent scaled up to what it could be this innovative program actually works we have proven it we have metrics that prove that the program increases access and participation for lowincome students and it helps to reduce administrative burdens and costs for school staff now you have heard my colleagues here talk about obesity now obesity is not just a cosmetic problem it is a major health problem we also last year put new nutrition standards in to ward off obesity ninetyseven percent97 percentof the schools have successfully met these new standards and usda has shown great eagerness to work with those who have not of course these new requirements require more servings of fruits vegetables whole grains fatfree and lowfat fluid milk in schools while cutting sodiumsaturated fats and trans fats i can tell you that when you introduce these foods to children at a young age they will start to prefer them and we can really transform their lives i want to skip over many of my comments and just add them to the record because i just want to focus on one little disease that is associated with poor nutrition and that is diabetes the burden to individuals and families is gargantuan you hear of people losing their limbs because of diabetes but i want to talk about the burden to the economy and to the budget by allowing diabetes to run amok diabetes is a budgetbusting disease it is an epidemic that is affecting an increasing number of americans including more and more of our youth right nowright nowin 2014 29 million people in the united states 9 3 percent of our population have had diabetes that is about 1 in 11 people according to the cdc by 2050 that number could be as high as 100 million or 1 in 3 persons 1900 the time to stop this is now while we are reauthorizing the child nutrition bill we can help our children develop healthy eating habits i have seen kids love avocados love grapes and love these things that are introduced to them while they are young our investment in school lunch and school breakfast pales in comparison to the cost of treating diabetes in 2012 diabetes and its related complications accounted for 245 billion in total costs now that is 176 billion in direct medical coststhink medicaid and medicareand lost wages and work the cdc estimates that the growth in theseif their predictions hold if we dont do something just think this will go from 1 in 11 people having diabetes to 1 in 3 so we are looking at 20502050 i dont think i am going to be around in 2050this is clearly a clarion call to feed our children properly now in the school year 2016 we spent 12 5 billion on the school lunch program and 4 3 billion on the school breakfast program compare that with the 245 billion that we have spent on diabetes for just 1 year with that i will add the rest of my comments to the record i would just say mr scott and that school breakfast school lunch and wic it is a doggone good deal when you think about it child nutrition reauthorization is a critical time for us to talk about the importance of improving access to healthy foods in schools and for maintaining strong nutrition standards for too many kids the only sure meals they can count on on a given day are the ones provided in school yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about how to make it harder for children especially lowincome children who are eligible for free and reduced price meals to access these programs the draft republican child nutrition reauthorization bill is an assault on the programs that help to ensure that our children and get the nutrition they need to be active and engaged learners a growling stomach does not advance educational achievement they want to roll back programs that have been proven to help eligible children get access to school breakfast and school lunch programs it is reportedly titled the improving child nutrition and education act of 2016 but it really should be the increasing child hunger and hobbling education act we should be using child nutrition reauthorization to address know gaps and help connect more children to healthy meals nearly 10 000 more schools offer school lunch than offer a school breakfast program participation in school breakfast programs though improving since the enactment of the healthy hunger free act and the nationwide implementation of cep still lags drastically behind participation in the school lunch program only about half of students who eat school lunch nationwide eat a school breakfast my state of wisconsin is at the bottom when it comes to the number of schools that participate in school breakfast nationwide over 162 000 kids that qualify for free or reduced meals are eating lunch but miss breakfast and wisconsin loses 22 million federal breakfast reimbursement dollars annually we need to be discussing how to help the states and schools do better we just passed the every student succeeds act last year reauthorizing federal elementary and secondary education policy let me tell you no child can succeed when theyre hungry any teacher can tell you that so can a range of experts who have conducted studies on this issue and found overwhelmingly that hunger does not promote academic achievement so what are republicans talking about doing in this reauthorization scaling back the successful and proven community eligiblity provision cep which just went into effect nationwide last year this is an innovative program authorized in 2010 that makes it easier for high need schools and school districts to serve free meals to all students by eliminating traditional free reduced priced applications with all the rhetoric about wasteful government spending and duplicative programs what happens when we have successful and proven federal programs and policies that work like cep like snap republicans want to cut them and roll them back this program has been proveni emphasize that word againto increase access and participation in the school meals programs for the lowincome students while helping to reduce administrative burdens and costs for school staff school meal programs benefit from the economics of scale the more kids who participate the cheaper it is to serve each child thousands of schools have adopted cep and are seeing benefits including the 156 schools in the milwaukee public school system in its first year mps reported serving 22 more school breakfasts school lunches also saw a gain cep means fewer kids are going hungry in milwaukee and nationwide enacting the gop bill would means that 7 000 schools that now currently participate would be dropped that is a gigantic step backwards for the health and nutrition of tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of school children who are at key stages of development physically and academically not to mention the students in thousands of schools currently eligible to participate in cep but would be kicked off under the republican bill we have put in place new nutrition standards for school meals97 of schools have successful met these new standards and the usda has shown great eagerness to work with those that have not to do so these new requirements require more servings of fruits vegetables whole grains and fatfree and lowfat fluid milk in school meals while cutting sodium saturated fat and transfats now some are trying to block the new rules and the savings to our nation both short term and long term for helping kids develop lifelong healthy eating habits let me just talk about the burden to individuals and taxpayers of just one disease diabetesa budget busting disease this is an epidemic affecting an increasing number of americans including more and more of our youth the number of americans with diabetes is estimated to drastically in the next three decades in 2014 29 million people in the unitedstates 9 3 percent had diabetes about 1 in 11 according to the cdc by 2050 that number could be as high as 100 million americans or 1 in 3 the time to stop this trend is right now when we can help our children develop healthy eating habits that will stay with them for the rest of their lives and a taste for healthy and nutritious foods through the school nutrition programs i want to compare our investments in school lunch and breakfast programs and helping to provide nutritious meals that will support lifelong eating habits to young people with what it will cost us to treat diabetes diabetes is an extremely expensive condition for our healthcare system given that it is associated with a number of complicated health effects in 2012 diabetes and its related complications accounted for 245 billion in total costs including 176 billion in direct medical costs think medicaid and medicare and lost work and wages if the cdc estimates about the growth in cases holds the cost of just this one disease will grow dramatically over the next three decades these costs will be picked up by all of us including through medicare and medicaid in contrast in fy 2016 we will spend 12 5 billion on the school lunch program and 4 3 billion on the school breakfast program maintaining healthy and nutrition meals and standards and ensuring that all who are eligible can participate in these programs seems like a very wise investment to me the gop proposal would bar schools from including the eligibility requirements for school meals on the school meal applications absolutely absurd what public policy purpose is served by such a requirement other than to make sure people dont know about a benefit to which they are entitled i also want to emphasize the need to further strengthen wic during this reauthorization wic works thats what the research tells us the program helps improve health and nutrition outcomes for at risk women infants and children wic breastfeeding rates are rising we all know the benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and child we can make wic better by increasing the certification period for infants and women taking steps to ensure that children a better transition by wic eligible children from the program to the school meals programs under current law children that age out of wic may not be enrolled in school and participating the school meals programs risking gains to their health and wellbeing from having participated in wic how about making wic work better for our men and women in uniform yes there are members of our military who receive wic in fact i know of efforts in the last year to close a wic clinic located on a military base in washington state serving over 700 people including navy families there is room for bipartisanship the senate agriculture committee reported a bipartisan billwhich while not perfect and i dont support every elementreflects an honest effort to reach across the aisle that is simply nonexistent in this chamber at this point and that is a shame for the children who rely on the school meal programs to meet their nutritional needs for the schools and school administrators who fight hard every day to put the students under their charge in a position to succeed for the american taxpayer who expect us to govern i know the will is there on this side of the aisle to work together on things like increasing the breakfast and lunch for that matter reimbursement rates to support grant programs to help increase access to school breakfast which remains woefully undersubscribed compared to the school lunch program we can provide grants to support innovative and proven models such as breakfast after the bell and in the classroom as well as school equipment grants to help offset some of the costs"], [4.4345855712890625e-05, 0.9999556541442871, 1, "i want to thank my colleague from virginia for organizing this today and for his leadership on child nutrition programs i want to thank all my colleagues for being here this is an important issue there is no question about that we are here because we are outraged we are outraged at republican attempts to undermine our child nutrition programs we are outraged at their lousy child reauthorization bill it is a terrible terrible terrible bill my friends should be ashamed of this bill a nutritious school meal is just as important to a childs success in school as a textbook hungry children cant concentrate they cant focus on their studies in short hungry children cannot learn that is a fact everybody knows that yet we have a bill that my republican friends have drafted that will increase hunger and that will actually take food out of the mouths of children it is outrageous together our child nutrition programs wic school breakfast and lunch the summer food service program and the child and adult care food program provide nutritional support for children year round in places where they live learn and play unfortunately h r 5003 which is the republican reauthorization bill includes a number of harmful provisions that would roll back years of progress and hamper the ability of children to access healthy meals as i said to be very blunt it makes hunger worse in this country specifically the bill would undermine the successful community eligibility provision which some of my colleagues have talked about first included in the last reauthorization bill that has allowed highpoverty school districts to offer universal school meals to all students in its first 2 years cep helped more than 8 5 million lowincome students access free meals instead of building on the success of this program my republican friends would severely restrict schools eligibility for the community eligibility option the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that 7 022 schools currently using community eligibility would lose it under this republican bill and another 11 647 schools that qualify for community eligibility but who have not yet adopted it would be prevented from doing so in the future as we approach the summer months it is also important to remember that child hunger gets worse in the summer consider this for every six children who get a lunch in school each day only one receives a meal in the summertime instead of being a carefree time for children who depend on getting healthy reliable meals during the school year the summer months can be a time of stress anxiety and hunger but it doesnt have to be this way unfortunately this republican bill cuts the successful summer ebt pilot program which provides a temporary boost in food assistance benefits during the summer months for families whose children receive free school meals during the school year and it fails to make necessary investments to expand the reach of summer food service programs so that more kids have access to healthy summer meals in their neighborhoods in addition this bill rolls back as my colleagues have mentioned evidencebased standards that make school meals healthier usda estimates that more than 90 percent of schools have successfullyhave successfullyimplemented these standards my grandmother used to say to me when i was growing up that an apple a day keeps the doctor away i wish she was still alive so i could tell her she was right food is medicine when we eat good food we eat nutritious food we tend to have healthy lives if you eat bad food if you eat junk food then you end up getting health issues like diabetes like high blood pressure and like obesity i could go on and on and on why in the world would anybody want to lower the nutrition standards in our school meals to give our kids junkier less nutritious food what sense does that make if my colleagues who are advocating these reversals of smart policy are doing so only because they want to save a few dollars then let me tell you something you are saving nothing if we dont get this right if we dont insist that our kids have access to nutritious healthier food the medical costs associated with the health challenges that they will experience are astronomical as my colleague from wisconsin mentioned earlier hundreds of billions of dollars in avoidable healthcare costs as a result of children not having access to good food 15 million children face hunger in this country instead of undoing the success we have already achieved congress should be focused on ways we can strengthen these vital child nutrition programs let me say finally it is hard for me to understand why we have to be here today why everything is a fight when it comes to dealing with issues of hunger and when it comes to dealing with issues and making sure our kids get access to good nutrition it is always a fight it is always a fight to protect so many vital food and nutrition programs that help our kids there is either a shocking ignorance about the reality of the poverty that millions of our children face in this country or there is simply indifference those are the only two ways i can explain what is going on in this chamber whichever one it is it is a sad excuse for what my republican friends are trying to do lets come together this should be a bipartisan issue there was a time when fighting hunger and when making sure that our kids had access to nutritious food was a bipartisan issue george mcgovern and bob dole worked together in the 1970s to strengthen our food and nutrition programs but now in this chamber these issues have become controversial it is sad because there are a lot of people in this country who are depending on us to find ways to end hunger in america they are depending on us to make sure that their kids when they go to school have access to nutritious food and that they have access to nutritious food during the summer months as well why are my friends making it so difficult enough enough of this stop beating up on the most vulnerable people in this country lets come together lets reject this awful draft of the child nutrition reauthorization bill lets come together and do this right it is the least we can do"], [4.4465065002441406e-05, 0.9999555349349976, 1, "i thank the gentleman from new jersey and the gentlewoman from illinois but i want to specifically say chicago i join my colleagues i think this is again an important statement of the value of the congressional black caucus i am glad our tone is such that we are compassionate we have emotion but we are detailed with the remaining time let me try to be concise on the value of the congressional black caucus in american history its place in this congress to be the provocative orators and articulators of the conscience of this nation let me first of all say that i have been privileged but certainly have mourned may 15 when all of us paid attention to fallen law enforcement officers who are honored here in the united states capitol any number of us has gone to the grounds and we have hugged those from our districts we have honored families and we have recognized the pain i think many of you recall that there was an assassination of sorts of a deputy sheriff in houston a number of unfortunate assassinations or shootings of police in new york and i saw the nation mourn i think it is important to say this because often when we say black lives matter it seems conflicted people raise the issues that african americans or the nation seem to be hesitant about law enforcement officers and that is not true i want to thank the congressional black caucus and chairman butterfield because we started out this year with a criminal justice agenda i just want to quickly go down memory lane or to reflect very quickly to say that it was the leadership and the combined members who raised a number of issues that have brought us to the point that we have actually passed in the senate and in the house judiciary committee criminal justice sentencing legislation we are not where we need to be but the sentencing reform act will reduce mass incarceration by 11 500 of those who are currently incarcerated it will give retroactive relief and an additional 4 000 will benefit each year combined with that it will be 50 000 over 10 years we are beginning to look at the criminal justice system in a way that speaks to the whole idea of blacks minorities hispanics and others being the fodder for the criminal justice system in my district in houston texas black and hispanic youth make up over 75 percent of the male population age 10 to 24 years but black and hispanic youth account for 85 percent of the youth admitted in our detention centers we are working on the reduction of sentencing and i think with the help of this bipartisan legislation which has been initiated and brought to the attention of this congress by members of the congressional black caucus in working with other members of this body both republicans and democrats we have legislation that should pass as we all know and as we have been mystified and mourning this tape i know that congresswoman kelly in her hometown has been a champion for justice along with her fellow colleagues of the congressional black caucus bobby rush and danny davis who have been front and center on these issues so we must continue the journey of dealing with the juvenile justice might i say that i hope we will come around the issues of the raise act of the fair chance for youth act and of kaliefs law ending solitary confinement for young people in the juvenile justice system banning the arrest record and of course giving alternative sentencing to these young people i want to quickly get back to this horrific shooting because what black lives matter speaks to is coming together around an improved law enforcement system that is why i came to the floor todayto be able to say unless we move forward on legislation that deals with best practices in our police departments we are going to continue the tension that should not exist there is no explanation or no answer to the video that has been shown i wonder what the sentencing or the reaction or the ultimate result would have been if there were a video of darren wilson and michael brown there was not i still believe that with michael brown an unarmed youth his actor who happened to be a law enforcement person should not have gone unpunished in this instance we see a video that was completely mischaracterized or in essence the story was characterized completely contrary to the video that was shown so what is the answer law enforcement officers who i work with all the time will indicate that there are bad apples and they are right then work with us to pass the law enforcement trust and integrity act which provides the roadmap and the incentive for all of these departments to be accredited and to have officers go through the specific training that documents how you address the question of the street it includes video cameras it includes communityoriented policing it includes grants to incentivize better training and better training practices we must find an answer in this term of congress we should not end this congress without a complete and reformed criminal justice system including dealing with law enforcement which is clearly what the congressional black caucus has been working on so i am hoping that we can find this common ground because there is no explanation that is reasonable or rational of the actions of the officer in chicago there is no reasonable explanation to the officer in the sandra bland case ladies and gentlemen you remember this young woman dying in a jail they have yet to come up with an indictment or a response they have yet to have an answer of the jail that standards were an embarrassment in waller county the district attorney has yet to come forward in the sandra bland case the family has not been notified the lawyer doesnt know what is going on we met with those individuals not to direct them but to ensure that they were going to respect this death nothing has happened about the stop that we saw in the video nothing has happened about the jail incarceration i simply have come to the floor to indicate to my colleagues republicans and democrats to work with us on a number of issues that those in the congressional black caucus reach out in the spirit of bipartisanship dealing with the voting rights reauthorization in section 5 providing opportunities for historically black colleges which we have been at the leadership realm of making sure that the criminal justice system addresses the overincarceration of our youth dealing with the question of policing which the black lives matters speaks to it eloquently we should not be condemned for the massive protests of 10 000 people down this wonderful michigan avenue as there they go again we have got to find a place at the table to be able to reorient if you will how we do policing in america i would ask my colleagues that we move swiftly in this term in this congress to be able to address this let me finish on this one last point the violence of guns is outrageous i want to speak very quietly about the planned parenthood incident because i dont want to provoke but i believe it is important to note we always say for those who dont want to hear us about gun safety closing the gun show loophole banning assault weapons which the individual had however it plays out the individual may be determined to have a mental health concern or condition but he had an automatic rifle of some sort and unfortunately we lost several persons in the course of the incident although the investigation is still ongoing it also happens in blackonblack crime my friends our community doesnt ignore that but what we say is that guns are involved in most of these deaths not only are guns involved but we must understand that when a gun is used by an officer it is distinct from blackonblack crime because it is under color of law the congressional black caucus comes to the table to ensure that these very sensitive issues are handled with the greatest delicacy but with the greatest commitment and passion that we want to stop the killing stop the deaths and have the decency to reflect on a parent like mr payne a parent like ms kelly a parent like myself black lives matter our children matter the congressional black caucus wants to work to ensure that we have the answers that the american people have asked us for and that they deserve as a senior member of the house committee on homeland security as well as the ranking member of the house judiciary committees subcommittee on crime terrorism and investigations i am pleased to join my colleagues of the congressional black caucus for this special order to speak to the issues that members of the 114th congress must address no other country imprisons a larger percentage of its population than the united states or spends anywhere near the 6 5 billion that we spend annually on prison administration we now know that the cost of imprisoning so many nonviolent offenders is fiscally unsustainable and morally unjustifiable and it will take the combined efforts of policy makers reform advocates legal professionals and private citizens to solve the problem congress took a giant step forward on the road to reform with a law i cosponsored the fair sentencing act of 2010 which eliminated the crack versus powder disparity earlier this month the house took another big step when its judiciary committee favorably reported another bill i sponsored the sentence reform act of 2015 which will help reform a criminal justice system that often seems less effective at reforming criminals and more effecting in inflicting collateral damage on families and communities specifically the sentence reform act will reduce mass incarceration by making over 11 500 individuals who are currently incarcerated eligible for retroactive relief and an additional 4 000 will benefit each year combined this is over 50 000 in ten years these estimates are conservative as not all the positive reforms can be quantified today we know also that more and more young children are being arrested incarcerated and detained in lengthy outofhome placements our youth easily encounter law enforcement through the mass transit on the way to school the school resource officer at school and patrol officers on the way home a youth experience behavior issues when encountered should not be arrested but assessed for underlying issues that can nearly always be handled without ever having contact with the justice system at least 75 percent of children within the juvenile justice system have experienced traumatic victimization making them vulnerable to mental health disorders and perceived behavioral noncompliance and misconduct numerous studies have also shown that as many as 7080 percent of youth involved in the justice system meet the criteria for a disability in my district in houston texas black and hispanic youth make up over 75 of the male population aged 1024 years yet black and hispanic youth account for 85 of youth admitted in our detention centers a majority of these admissions into detention are for minor and misdemeanor offensesbehavior that should not require locking youth up especially when the rate of detention continues to reflect disproportionate minority contact and criminalization of minority youth as we look to reform our juvenile and criminal justice system and be what president obama has called upon us be my brothers and sisters keeper we must move away from the engrained culture of criminalization as the answer to our problems these include i have introduced 13 additional pieces of legislation this congress pertaining to criminal justice reform"],

mr levin for your leadership i congratulate chairman brady for assuming his new position we all wish him success and look forward to working with him the bill before us today calls for very serious discussion we in this body have a very big responsibility to make decisions as architects of our childrens future where we are making decisions that strengthen the middle class and that take us to our responsibility to be custodians of our democracy the middle class is the backbone of our democracy and this legislation undermines the success of the middle class in terms of children their education the financial security of their families the pension security of their grandparents the health of the environment in which they live all of that is seriously affected by this legislation lets put it in perspective because this is part of a grand scheme that started after president clinton left office in his term of office because of the budget act of 1993 which passed with democratic support it unleashed a remarkable era of job creation and it took us on a path to deficit reduction in fact five of his last budgets were even or in surplus and that was taking us to a path of reducing not only the deficitof course it would be eliminatedbut the national debt along came tax cuts for the middle class and in just a few years all of the progress in reducing the deficit that occurred during the clinton administration was reversed by the bush tax cutsunpaid forfor the wealthiest that unpaid for is really what my problem is here today there are many provisions in this bill that we democrats take ownership of and i personally take some personal pride in having worked on for example the earned income tax credit and the childcare tax credit those initiatives we negotiated with president bush to take them to the place that they are they are a stimulus they were debated and passed at the time as part of president bushs stimulus package when it comes to some of the initiatives like r d we have all been talking about modernizing and making permanent the research and development tax credit the problem is unpaid for when we talk about 179 that is a creation of which democrats were very much a part which were the initiatives to help small businesses we fully subscribe to that but when we make them permanentand that might be a good ideaand they are unpaid for it also hurts our ability to do something broader in the tax code and take advantage of that opportunity so lowincome housing tax credits again i think i am second to noneexcept maybe mr rangelin this body in my advocacy for that when mr rostenkowski was the chairman of the committee it is important that they are in this legislation and they should be permanent my problem with it all is why are these thingslook this is an engine to send jobs overseas with some of the provisions that are in the legislation so it is like a trojan horse there are many good things and then all of a sudden you find out what is in the belly of them so the fact that they are permanent means that for certain things like bonus depreciation and things like that if they are for a short term people will take advantage of them we get the boost in our economy and our treasury from that here is what it comes down to you go down this path of 600plus billion of permanent unpaid for tax extenders largely benefiting corporate america and say that doesnt have to be paid for oh but by the way if you want to do 7 billion to honor the work of 9 11 first responders you have to pay for every penny of it find a way to do it by cuts or outlay or some other way so what is the symmetry in all of this tax cuts for businesses to send jobs overseas unpaid for and permanent 9 11 which is an emergency would you not agree if there ever were an emergency it would be 9 11 and the costs related to honoring our commitments both in health and compensation to those workers should be held up because we couldnt find payfors now we have so that is good we had to find the payfors what i question very seriously is what are the costs in the outyears it is hard to determine but they are there what they are going to do is increase the deficit with such seriousness that our country will have to borrow from the social security trust fund to stay afloat seriously undermining social securityand as our distinguished whip said social security medicare and the rest it seriously affects this legislation seriously affects our ability to make the discretionary investments in the education of our children the promotion of growth and the rest of that so i think what it comes down to is yes there are some good ideas in here we developed them we support them we dont even care if some of them are permanent it is the unpaid for part of it that is mortgaging our childrens future that is threatening social security and that undermines our ability to reduce the deficit and reduce the interest payments on the national debt again we are walking away from what president clinton did so successfully with a very difficult vote we lost the congress after that for that and other reasons some members did they said i did the right thing because it took us on a path of fiscal soundness and it took us on a path of economic growth this of course was reversed in the bush years the 5 5 trillion of deficit reduction wasthere was an 11 trillion reversal one of the biggest up until that time of a reversal my colleagues i sympathize with some who say well i have always been for r d tax credits and others who say well it has to do with the tax stuff in my state and all that i appreciate that and i respect your judgment on it there is a bigger picture here and the bigger picture is our responsibility to the future the chickens will come home to roost on this we will have to pay you know who is going to pay our children their families the social security system and the rest for that reason i will not be supporting this and i join our distinguished whip hoyer in urging our c01leagues to vote against it as well i know it sounds good but as i said it is a trojan horse and we should not be fooled"], [4.470348358154297e-05,

middle class 1800 of course as she so well says it will be good for those in poverty but it will also be good for all the rest of us they will help build a better economy they will help grow jobs and they will help america be stronger i am honored to join my friend chairwoman barbara lee of the democratic whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity for this special order i also want to thank chairman cleaver of the cbcs poverty and economy task force for the work that it has done in this area poverty is bad for your health poverty is bad for your mental health poverty is bad for children poverty is bad for families more than 50 years after president johnson declared unconditional war on poverty 46 million americans are still struggling in poverty that is not to say we havent made some progress there are programs we have adopted frankly medicare is a tremendous poverty program our seniors are better off and far less of them are in poverty because of medicare medicaid is a critical program to make sure that those who cannot afford it are nevertheless given health care which is important for all of us to have healthy citizens with whom we deal on a daily basis ours may be the wealthiest nation on earth but we can best measure americas economic success not by how many are at the very top but how few are stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder by that measure we have a long way to go to fulfill americas promise as a land of equal opportunity and of success even in 2015 the lines between rich and poor trace the old divides of race and background with 29 percent of native americans 26 percent of african americans and 23 percent of latinos living in poverty poverty also strikes of course our rural communities in fact in many respects there is more poverty in our rural communities than in our cities and urban communities it is more visible in our cities because they are aggregated although we ought not to forget that literallyas i just mentioned about minoritiesmillions and millions of nonminorities struggle in poverty every day poverty strikes children at a higher rate unfortunately one in five children in america as our leader says the task force we launched and which barbara lee chairs has been working hard to raise awareness in congress of these very real and very difficult challenges of poverty in america and to provoke policies that help alleviate suffering in the short term while working to eradicate poverty over the long term speaker ryan has raised poverty as an issue on which he is focused and he has visited areas of poverty in our country we could recognize poverty we can visit those in poverty but what it is important to do and what barbara lee is leading us to do is to adopt policies that almost eliminate reduce and empower those in poverty the number one rule on the war on poverty of course ought to be first do no harm this means making sure that we refrain from disinvesting in the critical programs that serve the poor and help millions stave off hunger homelessness and disease we ought to have those criteria in mind when we consider the appropriations bills tax bills and other policies that affect our people thankfully the recent bipartisan budget deal prevented the return of sequestrations severe and painful automatic cuts which would have disproportionately harmed the most vulnerable in our economy now congress has a responsibility to follow that up by passing an omnibus and avert a shutdown however not doing further harm is not enough congress has a responsibility first and foremost to help create jobs that put americans back to work and enable them to rise out of poverty and as congressman coleman watson indicated to make sure that when we ask people and give people the opportunity to work we value that work and pay them a living wage we cannot enable people to rise out of poverty if it keeps lurching from one manufactured crisiswhen i say it our policies here in congress on budgets on debt on investment and on taxesto the next if we lurch from one crisis to another we will not be able to succeed in enabling and empowering those currently in poverty we need to work together to invest in education workforce training and innovation to make our workforce more competitive and open doors of opportunity for those looking to get hired we also need to expand assistance for housing and nutrition as well as access to health care especially for children poverty need not be a cycle and should not be a cycle from generation to generation that is debilitating certainly for them but we ought to all recognize it is debilitating for us our communities and our country the promise of america has always been that this cycle can be broken that is what we think about america even if you are born in circumstances that are tough if you work hard and play by the rules you can rise above it we need to make sure that we give them that opportunity we need to take steps to make sure that hard work pays off that those who have jobs can earn enough not only to get by but to get ahead this means making child care more affordable for working parents enacting paid leave to care for sick loved ones and raising the minimum wage the new speaker mr ryan has indicated he takes very seriously the issue of poverty as i said i hope we can work together to address that problem in a serious responsible and effective manner not to do so would be a grave disservice to the future of our country and its people one area he has suggested we might find agreement is in expanding the earned income tax credit to childless adults which could lift an additional half a million americans out of poverty in addition to that we ought to index the itc we ought to index the child tax credit and we ought to index the opportunity tax credit so that we can empower and enable those who are working those who have children that we want wellcared for and safe to be more productive citizens i thank again chairwoman barbara lee and all of the members on the democratic whips task force on poverty income equality and opportunity and the cbcs poverty and economy task

country at this time with the issues of citizens being killed police officers being killed domestic violence to talk about people who may be mentally ill who are committing gun violence this is a very difficult subject you have heard from my colleagues for some days now about our determination to deal with this issue of gun violence you have heard about the bills that we have tried to get taken up on the floor to deal with gun violence very simple bills one bill that is a bill that has been characterized as no fly no buy simply meaning that if you are too dangerous to be on an airplane you are too dangerous to be able to buy a gun and of course universal background checks to make sure we know who is seeking to purchase weapons and what their backgrounds are and whether or not they should be allowed to purchase a gun in the middle of all of this work that we are doing we are painfully reminded that there is another issue and another problem that we have been confronted with year in and year out that really has not been dealt with and this problem is one that has reared its head one more time just a few days ago we witnessed the killings of alton sterling in baton rouge and philando castile in minnesota and of course because of the graphic pictures that were shown on television because of the cell phones that recorded what was going on it has really created the kind of discussion and organizing and rallying and protesting that forces us to have to deal with this issue even when it is too painful for many to deal with i would like to say that i have been dealing with this issue for many many years it started when i was in the california state legislature back in 1994 there was a woman named eula love who was shot down on her porch in front of her daughters because she had not been able to pay her utility bill her gas bill her heating bill and because she would not allow the gas company to turn off her heat they called the police and the police came out a confrontation ensued i think she had a butter knife that she waved at them and they shot eula love down on her porch i became very active back then in dealing with police shootings because as you know in the los angeles area there had been incidents prior to this dating back before this that had created the kind of protests and rallies that really caused people to fear what was happening in our communities so i organized i visited the police commission i organized others to visit the police commission we tried to set up meetings with the police chief at the time who was daryl gates daryl gates was a tough chief of police and he had no intentions of sitting down with the community to talk about police shootings he felt that every police shooting was justified and that the community had no right to question what happened when there was a confrontation between police and the community we organized we continued to put pressure on daryl gates more incidents occurred as a matter of fact when you heard about the death of eric gardner up in new york who died from something called the choke hold it really was a practice that was used in the los angeles area by police officers at that time daryl gates the police chief said that the black people who were killed as a result of the choke hold died because something was wrong with their carotid muscle that it was something abnormal about black people that caused them to die when they were placed in this kind of choke hold and so having worked in the greater los angeles area and witnessed police chief daryl gates learning and understanding the choke hold and even there was something called the battering ram and on and on and on i have known for many years that this was an issue that had to be dealt with and from time to time others have tried there have been meetings in various cities and towns in this country at police commissions many people have tried to create civilian police review boards it has been resisted in many cities and towns very few have been able to create citizen police review boards so these killings continue and they are disproportionately killings of black men and boys so when people raise the question about why so many black folks are involved in this issue it is because of the disproportionate number of african americans who find themselves killed and their families find their relatives killed at the hands of police now of course not all police are out looking to kill someone not all police are prejudiced not all police are bad officers but of course we know there are problems we have pointed to the training and we have asked for better training we have always felt that the buck stops at the top and that if police chiefs have the kind of training that we believe officers should have we could reduce the numbers of confrontations and killings of young black men in particular i dont know what has become of this training idea i think most police chiefs will tell you oh we do the proper training we have the best training of any police department in the country but somehow people who are the victims of police officers who are responsible for these killings really dont believe that the training is what it should be these killings are creating the kind of protests and rallies that are making a lot of people extremely uncomfortable we are all very saddened by the fact that we lost five police officers in dallas and that the killer of the police officers said he killed them because he was seeking revenge we do not want the revenge mentality to take hold in this country that is very dangerous what do we do about it what we do about it is keep working at how we can reduce these killings how we can eliminate these killings what can we do i have some ideas about this that i am working with some people on as a matter of fact i will be speaking to the national black lawyers association on monday in st louis missouri and i am going to talk with them about several ideas one of the ideas i want to talk with them about is encouraging more communities to meet on an ongoing and regular basis with police chiefs get to know them talk with them explain what has been said about them and the feelings of african americans in these communities get to know each other i am going to ask them to work with the members of the city councils who have the budgets of the police departments and with the county supervisors who have the budgets of the sheriffs departments talk with them and leverage your influence because you have the budget in your control to let them know how serious you are about reducing these killings and these confrontations the other issue that i am going to talk with the lawyers about is putting together a program to take to our police chiefs about reducing the confrontations by eliminating stopping these automobiles and these drivers on minor incidents minor problems of course there are going to be some taillights that need to be fixed but do you need to stop that motorist do you need to ask them to get out of the car do you need to ask them to get out of the car with their hands up do you ask them to get out of the car and lean over the back of the car legs spread arms spread do you need to ask them to get out of the car and tell them to lay on the ground while you search them do you need to search the car illegally what are you looking for e 1815 if in fact it is just a tail light cant you just give a warning cant you just give a ticket and go on about your business why is it that these police stops about tail lights and other infractions are causing so much confrontation of course as most drivers try to do the best they can in driving and taking care of their cars i am sure there are those who would like to get some things fixed whether it is a windshield wiper or a tail light or something else that may be wrong with the car but i am sure some may have to wait until the next payday they may not have enough money to do that they are not crooks and they are not criminals and they should be warned there is something in the black community that blacks have believed for a long time when kids are coming up they tend to get in trouble sometimes they vandalize sometimes they perhaps ring somebodys doorbell and run as someone was explaining the other night that was happening with their child or sometimes they will pull a prank and run away and then they get caught in the african american community we believe that oftentimes when children commit these kinds of minor offenses and the police stop them they take them home to momma or they tell them to get out of there and go home but when black kids are stopped the black community believes our kids are taken to jail we have got to straighten out some of the misunderstandings about what happens when black boys in particular and black men are stopped on these infractions we believe that a lot of confrontations do not have to take place if in fact these minor offenses are not treated like crimes we believe that we can reduce the occurrence of these confrontations by convincing the police departments that they should not be asking folks to get out of their cars and creating a confrontation people should not be calling each other names we want to eliminate from the mouths of any police officers the nword or the kind of language that is oftentimes used when they decide that they are going to stop someone and that they are going to raise questions or they are going to search them et cetera we believe that that is a legitimate thing to do so i am going to be recommending to the national black lawyers association that we put together a program that we present to these police chiefs and these police departments about reducing confrontation and discontinuing the stops on minor offenses that end up in confrontations and killings the other thing that i am going to be recommending not only to the national black lawyers association but to the news media and to these channels who cover all of this why cant we have some public service announcements that go on every day and maybe at the end of every day where people are reminded about safe driving and taking care of their cars getting those windshield wipers fixed getting those tail lights fixed making sure that the windows are working why cant we have public service announcements that just keep reminding people to have your insurance documentation in the car with youall of those things that could reduce the kind of stops that we are witnessing time and time again that are ending in confrontation i believe that there are many other things that we can do if we think about it i know there is a lot going on about having discussions people say that we should talk to each other more well that is fine and that is good and for all of those people who would like to be involved in discussions with each other in their communities or with the police department you should do that but talk is cheap and it really is going to take some concerted actions to be able to deal with this problem there are some police officers who should just be weeded out they have no business being police officers they are either triggerhappy or they are prejudiced and when they see a young black man sixfoottwo sixfootthree weighing 200 pounds they are automatically afraid of them and they think that they have to protect themselves against them simply because of the size of the individual when we take a look at eric gardner up in new york who was of such size where he was wrestled to the ground simply because he was selling loose cigarettes that was all about we believe some officer proving that they were not afraid of him and they could take him to the ground and they could deal with him of course it is what triggered his death there was no need to tackle him i just saw on television the other day a famous i believe tennis player who was standing in new york and was rushed by police because they said he fit the description of someone who had been reported who had committed a crime now when you say that you stopped a young black man because they fit the description nobody believes that we have heard that over and over and over again and blacks believe that that is an excuse to stop somebody and it is a convenient excuse to say well we stopped him because he fit the description they dont have any other reason to stop they have not violated anything they dont have traffic warrants et cetera et cetera but this excuse has been used over and over again he fit the description and that is why we stopped when people are the victims of those who say they fit the description of course they are angry of course they are going to tell the police officer that they didnt fit the description and they dont like this happening and that causes another kind of confrontation so we need to be able to talk with the police chiefs and tell them these kinds of things and we need to get rid of that culture of silence in the police department one officer can witness another officer actually committing a crime he could see that police officer targeting and treating somebody bad but they will never ever admit it they will never ever report it that culture of silence and protection is something that we all know about and it happens every day so we need to be honest about what the feelings are and the police need to be honest with us about what they think about what they are doing in these kinds of situations even in all that i have heard on television in the last few days where they supposedly are having townhall meetings supposedly talking about these issues i have not heard the real truth come out about how members of the african american community who have witnessed too much of this really feel about the police and i have not heard the police talk about how they really feel about those that they think are committing crimes or should be stopped or what they understand about them and what is going on in the community so i am hopeful that we can have a real conversation because i want to tell you as we take a look at what has happened just in the last year or so what we find is 1 205 people have been shot and killed by onduty police officers since january 1 2015 in the first 6 months of 2016 465 people were shot and killed in 2016 491 were shot and killed in 2016 there was a 6percent increase in the number of such deaths during the first 6 months of the year fatal encounters are strikingly similar to last years shootings where blacks continue to be shot at 2 5 times the rate of whites police have shot and killed a young black man ages 1829 such as michael brown in ferguson missouri 175 times since january 2015 and 24 of them were known to be unarmed so whether we are talking about michael brown eric gardner ezell ford tamir rice john crawford kimani gray walter scott freddie gray sandra bland rekia boyd laquan mcdonald or the last two that we have seen on television almost every night for the last week or so alton sterling and philando castile and names that we dont knowthose names are not mentioned here because they have not been reported and we dont have the kind of database for these killings that we should have that is another recommendation that i am making that we must have a database that is kept so that we can know for sure exactly who is being killed and why supposedly they are being killed this is tough business that we have to deal with this is painful business that we have to deal with but when you see those mothers on television as i saw last evening saying i have a 14yearold and i am afraid for his life every minute he is not with me and folks tell us that you should talk to them more and you should tell them how they should act when they are stopped by the police i want to tell you every african american mother and father that i know talk to their children about the police they are afraid that they are going to be killed they are afraid that they are not going to come home once they leave the house they talk to them about how to conduct themselves if they are stopped by the police while they shouldnt have to act any differently than anybody else mothers and fathers of black children talk to their children about that all the time they say to them if they stop you make sure you keep your hands visible put them up on the dashboard so they wont think you are reaching for something if they ask you to get your drivers license out you tell them to take it out of your pocket because you are afraid that if you go in your pocket to get your drivers license there will be an excuse to shoot you down too many of them have said and will say we thought they were reaching for a weapon black people for the most part tell their young boys and their young men not only to keep their hands visible but dont talk back to the police make sure you dont look as if you are reaching for something and be very very careful that you dont do anything that will cause them to shoot you now this is real this goes on all the time i dont know if people know or understand this none of us are saying that we want our children to be in confrontation that we want our men to be in confrontation that we want our girls to be in confrontation with the police we always teach everything that we can about staying out of a situation where there will be an excuse to kill or shoot you body cameras we have advocated for body cameras and now we find that in this last incident i believe in minnesota the body camera somehow was on the ground and it wasnt working or the body camera was not turned on in some instances that we hear about or even when the body camera records in many instances and maybe under practices and law in some cities that information cannot be revealed for some long period of time until after certain things have taken place within the police department so we have talked about that and we have advocated for body cameras we were hoping that they would help us to understand what was going on but we find that just plain old citizens with a cell phone are doing more to document what is happening than the body cameras that we advocated for as a matter of fact but for cell phones we would not have known what happened in baton rouge and we would not have known what happened in minnesota the sight of a man being pinned down on the ground unable to move a gun being put at very close range to his body and being killed is more than most folks can bear most folks looking at what happened in baton rouge and what happened in minnesota know that something is wrong with that that that is not right it is not just black folks there are many white folks who understand and believe it is something wrong with this picture so while we are talking about gun violence and we would love to be able to focus on laws that we could create to keep the guns out of the hands of people who shouldnt have them we have got to deal with also what is happening in our country with the confrontations between african american men and boys in particular and girls and police officers so i share this information with you as difficult as it is to talk about it because until we get to the point of honesty about what we feel and what we understand and what we believe is going on we are never going to be able to deal with this problem i am going to continue to work on this like i said i started in 1994 and while my attention and my career has been diverted to deal with financial services and other kinds of issues on wall street i have got to get back to main street and i have got to get back to the idea that we can do better than this and that our country cannot continue to not know how to deal with it but rather come up with creative ideas and thoughts and ways by which we can discontinue these killings i yield back the balance of my time"],

appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [4.565715789794922e-05, 0.999954342842102,

our economy and to our nation without opportunity for members to offer amendments without clear consideration and without certainly robust debate the bills have bounced from one chamber to another jumped back and forth between in every iteration that can be cooked up the procedural machinations do deep disservice not only to the bills but to the people it will impact and i think even to the house of representatives thomas jefferson who authored the legislative manual that guides our procedure would be pained to see the path by which these trade packages have come to the floor from beginning to end members of this body have been shut out shut out from reading the text of the transpacific partnership that has now been fasttracked and we are not being able to discuss it with our constituents it is not just the american representatives that have been silenced either the trade deal is upending legislative bodies across the world and particularly in another great democracy involved in this agreementaustralia the peoples representatives in australia could not look at this bill even though they had great concern that phrma was going to do great harm to their own health system in australia as well as in new zealand they couldnt even go to see about that unless they signed a paper that they would not discuss it for 4 years so two of the great democracies on the planet working on this trade bill the united states and australia basically shut out the peoples representatives from knowing what it is that we are even talking about today i insert for the record the text of an article about the australians an article from the guardian from june 11 titled leaked trade deal terms prompt fears for pharmaceutical benefits scheme gabrielle chan the leak of new information on the transpacific partnership agreement tpp shows the megatrade deal could provide more ways for multinational corporations to influence australias control of its pharmaceutical regulations revealed via wikileaks the annexe on transparency and procedural fairness for pharmaceutical products and medical devices uncovered the draft agreements regarding medicines between the 12 tppa member countries the leak comes as us republican leaders announced a vote on friday that may provide barack obama a fasttrack authority to complete the agreement with australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam the countries represent 40 of the worlds economy the leaked text dated december 2014 laid out the draft rules for member countries regarding medicines under national health care programs in australias case the pharmaceutical benefits scheme pbs the tpp has yet to be signed off the abbott government has argued the trade deal will provide access for australian products to other markets but it requires australia to trade off regulations that stop access by other countries and particularly multinational companies to the australian market critics have suggested the deal which is likely to include investor state dispute settlement isds clauses will allow big corporations to sue australian governments philip morris international is currently challenging the former labor governments tobacco plain packaging laws under a hong kong trade treaty isds trade experts leaped on the rare information release regarding the secret but wideranging trade deal deborah gleeson a lecturer at the school of psychology and public health at la trobe university said the inclusion of an annexe on health serves no useful public interest purpose it sets a terrible precedent for using regional trade deals to tamper with other countries health systems and could circumscribe the options available to developing countries seeking to introduce pharmaceutical coverage programs in future gleeson said jane kelsey of the faculty of law of the university of auckland described the annexe as one of the most controversial parts of the tpp in her analysis she said the us pharmaceutical industry was using the trade agreement to target new zealands pharmaceutical management agency pharmac equivalent to the pbs this transparency annexe seeks to erode the processes and decisions of agencies that decide which medicines and medical devices to subsidise the public money and by how much kelsey said this leaked text shows the tpp will severely erode pharmacs ability to continue to deliver affordable medicines and medical devices as it has for the past two decades that will mean fewer medicines are subsidised or people will pay more as copayments or more of the health budget will go to pay for medicines instead of other activities or the health budget will have to expand beyond the cap whatever the outcome the big global pharmaceutical companies will win and the poorest and most vulnerable new zealanders will lose ama president brian owler said while doctors were very concerned at the possible effects on australias healthcare systems they were constantly dismissed by the trade minister andrew robb when we have raised concerns about the effects on health the only response is we are not going to undermine the pharmaceutical benefits scheme said owler we are worried about the investor state dispute settlement isds mechanism and there are issues in terms of patents that would affect pharmaceutical prices the problem is our concerns have been dismissed by the trade minister but we do not know what is in the text however robb said on thursday that the government would not accept anything that would adversely affect the pbs the health system more generally or increase the price of medicines for australians its perhaps time to look at the enormous benefits that will flow from a more seamless trade and investment environment across 12 countries representing 40 percent of global gdp robb said new levels of market access and common sets of trading rules will help support growth create new jobs and result in higher living standards parliamentarians were offered the chance to see the tpp draft by robb if they agreed to a four year nondisclosure agreement a crossparty parliamentary working group has formed including greens senator peter whishwilson labor mp melissa parke and independent senator nick xenophon whishwilson who has not seen the draft as he refused to agree to the terms of the agreement said the latest leak suggested the australian pbs could be undermined these negotiations are happening behind closed doors without the scrutiny of the parliament he said at the very least the australian people deserve to be reassured that the government wont allow any deal which drives up the public health costs for australian taxpayers such as further subsidising important new medicines including biologics during the most recent senate estimates in the past fortnight whishwilson questioned officials from the department of foreign affairs and trade about the strategic importance of the tpp to the united states the secretary of dfat peter varghese said the whole purpose was to indicate a ramped up us presence in asia the conclusion of the tpp is important to the united states in terms of its rebalance because it is an important step in relation to the economic engagement of the united states with the region and the whole purpose of the rebalance was to indicate a ramped up us presence in asia and a recognition of the importance of asia in broader us geostrategic thinking varghese said we in australia have never seen the tpp as an instrument for locking anybody out in fact quite the contrary the

that i have been hearing for the last 10 years since i have been in congress since i first went to an independent community pharmacist and you spoke with such great passion you are not alone as you know every single person like you in my district can tell me the same things that you have told me that is why i am on these bills that is why i am talking tonight about these issues i dont have the firsthand experience that you have as a pharmacist the closest i ever got to a pharmacy other than picking up my prescription drugs before i got into congress was when i was 16 and 17 years old i was a delivery boy for greenville pharmacy in sioux city iowa which by the way still exists since 1969 actually longer ago than that it was established but i would deliver prescription drugs to folks especially to the elderly who couldnt get out of their home who couldnt get to the pharmacy that is what this is about as you said it is about making sure ultimately and as a member of congress my job is to make sure that folks have access to affordable quality health care and that is where pharmacists play such an important role whether it is with medication therapy management or just simply consulting on an informal basis with someone who comes in and has a lot of different prescriptions and is confused by what to take and when to take them you folks really do such a wonderful job and if we lost that service as you said because of unfair business practices because of being squeezed by the big guysand it doesnt make any sense at all for that to happenthen patients would suffer in the end that is why i support both of these pieces of legislation two of these that have been mentioned already 244 which mr collins just mentioned again to make sure that everyone understands what it is about it is a measure that will increase transparency of generic drug payment rates in medicare part d and the federal employees health benefits program which serves a lot of folks as we know millions of folks and in the tricare pharmacy program by requiring those pbms one to provide pricing updates at least once every 7 days that doesnt seem like a lot to ask to me and i am sure it doesnt seem like a lot to ask for you number two disclose the sources used to update that mac list and to notify pharmacies of any changes in individual drug prices before these prices can be used as a basis of reimbursement this is complete common sense that is why there are republicans and democrats alike on this bill and i hope we can move this bill forward in iowa the state legislature did pass something not quite this comprehensive but something similar to this because in iowa folks understand what these pbms are doing and what those independent community pharmacists are up against and the second piece of legislation h r 592 that was already referenced again a bipartisan piece of legislation has got 218 cosponsors if memory serves me that is exactly the number we need if everybody votes to pass a piece of legislation in this body we could get it done if we brought it to the floor we could get it done maybe we ought to do a discharge petition sorry i dont mean to create too many anxieties there with you folks but nonetheless we have got to get this thing done it is about making sure that our pharmacists are able to continue to deliver the kind of quality health care look whatever we decide at the federal level when it comes to utilizing pharmacists to their full potential this legislation does stipulate that nothing will override state scope of practice laws as well because i know that a lot of folks in other professions have concerns about that that pharmacists are going to go too far well they are not going to if states have laws in place about scope of practice this legislation will not override that but it is about making sure as mr carter said and as mr collins would agree and others who have been so active on these issues would agreeit is about making sure that folks get the quality care that they need if we close down these pharmacies in these rural areas95 percent of the folks in iowa are within 5 miles of an independent community

apparently what our republican colleagues worked so hard to do was to take affordable health care away from 22 million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced with a tough choice i can assure them it is not a tough choice for the president because it is not a tough choice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care away from 22 million americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice for the president the republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the consequences of the 2016 elections because we are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i know all of them on the republican side they would be signing this bill so this is an important statement of what our republican colleagues think is the top priority on the first day of 2016 which is to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million americans lets talk about that with the american public because i believe that the american public wants to do what the gentleman from massachusetts said where we find
