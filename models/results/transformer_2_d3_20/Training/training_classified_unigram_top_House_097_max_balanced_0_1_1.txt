wilderness candidate areas by other 1 000 applications for oil and gas and other mineral leases in existing wilderness areas and an additional untold number of lease applications in areas that are under review for possible addition to the national wilderness preservation system the bill protects existing wilderness by permanently withdrawing it from mineral leasing and affords temporary protection to wilderness candidate areas time is of the essence in enacting this legislation because an existing moratorium on leasing in wilderness expires at the end of this current session of congress however prior to discussing the merits of the legislation in detail i believe it would be helpful to briefly describe the events which led us to the point we are at today when congress passed the wilderness act in 1964 it did so with the intention of securing for the american people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness at the same time a political compromise was reached in section 4 d 3 of the wilderness act which allowed discretionary mineral leasing in wilderness until 1984 to the same extent as applicable prior to the effective date of this act at that time and prior to enactment of the wilderneis act it was forest service policy not to recommend approval of mineral lease applications in wilderness wild and primitive areas except in the rarest of circumstances where directional drilling or other nonsurfacedisturbing methods could be used to avoid any invasion of the surface of such areas this policy remained in the forest service manual and was followed by every administration until this one on may 14 1981 the longstanding policy against leasing was revised and both the departments of agriculture and the interior now indicate that they interpret the law to deny them discretion to reject mineral lease applications solely on wilderness grounds in addition the government has been considering applications to allow explosive seismic prospecting in wilderness interior secretary james watt has stated that this new interpretation of the law is likely to continue and has suggested that congress amend the law if it wishes to clearly enunciate a policy against leasing in wilderness and wilderness candidate areas just prior to and after the may 1981 policy change a series of events gradually aroused public concern over the wilderness leasing issue in early 1981 the forest service considered allowing seismic expleration involving the use of explosives in the bob marshall wilderness complex in montana the public also learned that over 340 oil and gas lease applications were pending in the bob marshall complex on september 1 1981 the bureau of land management issued three leases in the capitan mountains wilderness area in new mexico without completing an environmental impact statement and without notice to the public or the congress on october 5 1981 the forest supervisor for the ouachita national forest in arkansas recommended leasing in a portion of the caney creek wilderness without opportunity for public comment prior to making his decision interior committee members subsequently received a letter from senator bumpers requesting that we assist him in obtaining an emergency withdrawal of the area to prevent any leasing the senator also wrote forest service chief max peterson to express his opposition to leasing on october 22 1981 the forest service issued a draft environmental assessment recommending oil and gas leasing within the ventoana wilderness on californias big sur coast the santa lucia wilderness and the proposed dick smith wilderness this leasing was roundly condemned by numerous members of the california congressional delegation and the big sur areas congressman leon paneta on november 13 1981 the forest service issued a draft environmental impact statement recommending the leasing of 89 000 acres of wyomings washakie wilderness despite concern expressed by the wyoming congresaugutst 9 1985 sional delegation and as i understand it opposition from roughly 98 percent of the public that commented on the leasing proposal in january 1982 the existence of lease applications covering some 49 000 acres of the alpine lakes wilderness in washington state became public knowledge both the governor of washington and the entire congressional delegation responded to the overwhelming public sentiment against leasing by indicating their opposition to any leasing in the alpine lakes area just 2 weeks ago the public became aware of oil and gas lease applications covering some 31 260 acres of the wellknown and often photographed maroon bellssnowmass wilderness which spans the extraordinarily spectacular high country between aspen and crested butte colo oil and gas development in this area could have severe adverse impacts on the resident elk herd and on the existing heavy use of the area for hunting fishing and other primitive recreation information supplied by the forest service reveals that there are currently over 1 000 applications pending for oil and gas leases covering more than 3 million acres of existing wilderness and also numerous applications for geothermal and other minerals leasing it appears that the 1981 policy change has sparked interest in leasing in wilderness with new lease applications being filed constantly unless congress acts to ban leasing it seems likely that lease issuance could begin on a nationwide basis shortly after the expiration of the current moratorium at the end of this year indeed the forest service estimates that absent a leasing ban 1 million will be spent just to process lease applications in wilderness areas in fiscal year 1983 alone in response to this threat and in order to give congress time to examine the issue in detail in november 1981 th6 house interior committee voted 41 to 1 to request secretary watt to refrain from issuing leases in wilderness until june 1982 in late january the secretary extended the moratorium until the end of the current session of the 97th congress however the moratorium applies only to the actual issuance of leases and not necessarily to the preparation of environmental impact statements or other actions administratively or legally required prior to leasing thus even as the moratorium is in place work preparatory to leasing and the processing of lease applications is continuing in many instances it is possible therefore that many lease applications will be deemed procedurally ready for approval when the moratorium expires and that leases could be issued rapidly after that date absent legislation or other congressional action for example in a may 1982 draft environmental impact statement on the land management plan for the san juan national forest in colorado leasing was tentatively recommended in portions of the south san juan lizard head and weminuche wilderness areas in recognition of this situation on december 16 1981 congressman phillip burton introduced the wilderness protection act to permanently withdraw all wilderness and wilderness candidate areas from mineral leasing and hardrock mining then in late february 1982 secretary watt responded with his own version of a wilderness protection bill which afforded some temporary protection for wilderness and wilderness candidate areas but at the same time contained other provisions to open wilderness candidate areas for timber harvest road construction water projects ski area construction and other development the watt bill would also have allowed the president to open wilderness areas to mineral leasing and development without the concurrence of congress with bills thus introduced representing two widely divergent concepts of wilderness protection and with the moratorium due to expire in late 1982 the subcommittee on public lands and national parks which had already held 2 days of hearings on the subject held an additional 7 days of hearings in march and april as is generally the case with the subcommittees hearings the hearings were open to anyone who wished to testify and all those who called in to sign up were given time to speak by the end of april testimony had been received from some 516 witnesses at hearings in washington d c cody wyo grand junction colo santa ana calif san francisco calif seattle wash and st paul minn of the 516 witnesses who testified some 490 opposed mineral leasing and development in wilderness and roundly condemned the concepts of the watt bill the burton bill on the other hand received strong support based on testimony at the hearing and other public input mr lujan the ranking republican on the interior committee and i consulted with other members and determined that it would be advisable to fashion a compromise bill which reflected the basic wilderness protection goals of the popular burton bill but moderated certain provisions accordingly a compromise bill was prepared during may 1982 and was introduced as h r 6542 on june 8 the bill was reported by the subcommittee on public lands and national parks on june 18 and by the interior committee on june 24 on a rollcall vote of 34 to 7 as the preceding summary of recent events indicates h r 6542 is a necessary response to documented threats to the national wilderness preservation system as well as a bipartisan effort to avoid the controversy which will ensue if secretary watts moratorium expires prior to the enactment of legislation and above all the bill addresses the publics desire to see wilderness and wilderness candidate areas placed off limits to leasing this desire stems from the belief that wilderness and mineral development are simply incompatible and that a small percentage of the federally owned lands should be off limits to development even if they appear to have some mineral potential the statistics and other evidence support this belief at the outset it should be remembered that the withdrawals of h r 6542 are limited to existing wilderness and national forest wilderness candidate areas and as such cover roughly 2 percent of the land in the lower 48 states the withdrawals to not cover blm wilderness study areas but even if those were to be added the department of energys contractors at the oak ridge national laboratory estimate that wilderness and wilderness candidate areas contain only on the order of 3 percent of the nations undiscovered oil resources and 2 percent of the nations undiscovered gas resources interestingly a study conducted for the wilderness society by mr leonard fischman of economic associates inc independently confirms the oak ridge national laboratory estimates to within onehalf of 1 percent moreover the oak ridge experts testified that they saw little justification for allowing mineral activities in existing wilderness areas and believed that the existing review process prior to wilderness designation adequately insures that wilderness candidate areas with truly meaningful mineral potential are not included in wilderness thus it is clear that h r 6542s withdrawal of roughly 33 million acreas of wilderness and wilderness candidate areas not already statutorily closed to leasing will have minimal impacts on energy supplies or the availability of new areas for exploration further the negligible potential impact of h r 6542 on energy supplies is highlighted by the fact that there are already some 137 million acres of largely unexplored federal land outside wilderness and wilderness candidate areas in the lower 48 states under existing oil and gas lease this is over four times the amount of land withdrawn by h r 6542 the department of the interior estimates and the general accounting office confirms that up to 80 percent of these existing leases will expire without exploratory drilling mostly because as gao found many lease applicants seek leases for speculation only in addition some 100 million acres of federal lands classified as prospectively valuable for oil and gas but not yet leased and lying outside wilderness are available for possible future leasing given these statistics i share the publics opinion that wilderness and wilderness candidate areas should not be leased now and certainly should not be leased unless and until all the wilderness values such impacts are existing leases and other prospectively acknowledged by the federal agencies valuable leasing areas outside wilder which administer the land for examness have been fully explored and de ple in its report to the house interior veloped in short wilderness and wil committee on the 1981 emergency derness candidate areas should be the withdrawal of the bob marshal willast areas to be

wildlife scen been or may be selected as wilderness ery primitive recreation and other in order to permanently protect their paramount wildlife fisheries watershed esthetic and recreational values this risk takes on added significance when one recognizes that in addition to such intangible values as scenery recreational opportunities and the mere satisfaction of knowing that wilderness exists somewhere in our modern environment wilderness also has ascertainable dollarsandcents value as a producer of wildlife populations high quality and quantity water flows and as the source of thousands of jobs in the outfitting licensed guide and other recreation industries in this regard i would note that i have personally visited several commercial outfitter operations that would be forced to shut down if the wilderness quality lands on which they depend for their living were opened to mineral or other development my point in discussing these impacts is to illustrate in the clearest possible terms that h r 6542 is not a politically motivated or hysterical reaction to some imagined threat posed to wilderness by the policies of secretary watt rather it is a carefully rensoned response based on voluminous public input to the basic incompatibility between wilderness values and mineral development and to the wilderness leasing policy change that was implemented by the departments of interior and agriculture in 1981 as such h r 6542 does the following"], [0.011257946491241455, 0.9887420535087585, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i first of all would like to commend the

leontieff the nobel prizewinning economist and authority on economic structures at new york university and dr lester thurow of mit in the last few months have all voiced the strongest doubts about the economic viability and desirability of the reagan administrations defense program i notice yesterday as reported in the washington post today the mormon church and its leaders ii a very rare comment on national policies came out in opposition to the mx missile system their statement of opposition it should be noticed by my colleagues went far beyond the mx missile the mormon church leadership squarely attacked the basic assumptions behind the unitedstates military establishment the soviet military establishment and the frightening global arms race that both superpowers equally are contributing toward referring to the terrifying arms race that~ has to be halted spencer w kimball president of the mormon church stated we deplore in particular the building of vast arsenals of nuclear weaponry history indicates that men have seldon created armaments that eventually were not put to use 0 with the most serious concern over the pressing moral question of possible nuclear conflict we plead with our national leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find viable alternatives the mormon church leadership is referring to the deadly world arms race that is draining nations of their resources and revenues that otherwise would be spent on economic and social develolimentspecifically which last year exceeded 500 billion dollars and which the reagan administration in its budget proposal is contributing mightily toward i believe there is a growing sense in this body that the defense budget will undo~whatever good might resultfrom administration economic policies and i say this as one who is highly skeptical about the administrations policies if the congresssional black caulcus and a handful of socalled house liberals alone had challenged the reagan defense budget it likely would have been dismissed summarily but the caucus is not alone in its criticism of the transfer of some 50 billion in additional budget authority to dod next year we are joined by leading churches in the land by highly respectable economists and financial leaders the simple truth is that the defense budget that the administration is proposing will intensify inflation because inflationary costs in the defense sector have been running at twice the rate as in the economy overall intensify inflation because of the widely acknowledged shortages of pro may 6 1981 duction in the defense sector and in the shortages of its labor force intensify inflation because of the widely reported monopolistic practice among defense contractors the lack of competitive contract bidding at dod and the widespread lack of pentagon control over its own budget intensify inflation because in the aggregate boosts in defense spending add income but not consumer goods and services and therefore add to the class inflation of too many dollars chasing too few goods and shift badly needed investment capital away from the civilian sectors of the economy that are mnost in need of revitalization i detect among my colleagues especially on the opposite side of the aisle a growing uneasiness about the administrations and the latta0ramms defense budget that uneasiness is understandable no one has come up with a convincing argument why an additional 50 billion in defense is needed other than the ageold shibboleths about national security and the russians are coming this morning i went over some comparative figures on the relative strengths of the unitedstates defense establishment and the soviets in termsa of defense spending during the last 10 years the nato allies have outspent the warsaw pact by 207 billion according to londons international institute for strategic studies in terms of strategic nuclear warheads the best measure of relative numerical strengths the united states has 9 200 warheads as compared to 7 000 on the soviet side of equal importance the united states has far greater command control flexibility and survivability in relation to its ability to fight a nuclear war than has the soviet union for example only 25 percent of our strategic warheads are land basedand relatively vulnerableas compared to 80 percent of the soviets warheads and because of our triad of strategic forceslandbased seabased and airbasedthe united states has a wide advantage over the soviets for example 48 percent of our strategic warheads are either at sea alert or in bombers on alert as compared to 3 percent of the soviets warheads there is a shocking orthodoxy in this chamber about the need for a stronger defense establishment despite the facts and figures despite the questionability of ever winning a nuclear war however limited or of needing any more nuclear arms than we presently have as the mormon church leaders observed my col leagues especially on the other side of the aisle still cling to the panacea of more defense spending as if it were a reflex action that arises when no other solutions to our economys problems and the worlds problems are in sight i think we ought to debate many more hours the role of defense spending in the administrations budget and in relation to economic recovery we ought to debate many more hours the assumptions behind the reagan lattagramm budget and the alternative that the congressional black caucus is proposing i would now like to touch briefly upon a matter which in terms of dollars may be considered relatively insignificant in relation to the overall federal budget however it is a very important matter because of its direct bearing upon the quality of justice in this country i speak of the legal services corporation when the congress enacted the legislation establishing the legal services corporation in 1974 it made findings about the need for such a program the congress specifically found that first there is a need in this country for equal access to our system of justice second there is a need to provide highquality legal assistance to those who are unable to afford it third providing legal assistance to those facing an economic barrier to obtaining legal help serves the ends of justice fourth the availability of legal assistance has reaffirmed for many people their faith in our government of laws pifth a legal services program should be kept free of the influence of political pressures and sixth attorneys who provide legal assistance under such a program must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients just as other members of the bar have full freedom to protect their clients interests those findings are as valid and accurate today as they were in 1974 and the need for a legal services corporation today is as great as it was in 1974 continued funding of the corporation is essential if we are to keep this countrys commitment to equal justice under the law the need for the continuation of the legal services corporation has been widely recognized in addition to numerous individual private attorneys district attorneys judges state attorneys general and state governors many national organizations have called for continued funding of the corporation including the american bar association the american association of retired persons national association of retired teachers the aflcio the american coalition of citizens with disabilities the childrens defense fund the friends committee on national legislation the league of united latin american citizens lulac the lead ership conference on civil rights the national bar association the national council of churches the national council of senior citizens the national committee against discrimination in housing the national mental health association the national farmers union the national council on aging the national urban league the national legal aid and defender association the united states conference of mayors the united states catholic conference and rural america one of the announced goals of this administration is a reduction in what it refers to as unnecessary and inefficient federal regulations continuation of the legal services corporation will not frustrate that goal the legal services corporation does not engage in any substantive regulation and it is not a part of the federal bureaucracy in addition the corporations programs are locally controlled the corporation has been soundly managed and its programs have been costeffectiveit expends only 1 8 percent of its funds on management and administration and another 1 8 percent for field monitoring and evaluation continuation of the legal services corporation has bipartisan support just last monday the judiciary committees subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice unanimously reported an authorization bill for the corporation that bill authorizes 200 million for the corporation for each of the next 2 fiscal years in addition the bill addresses some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the corporation such as in the area of class action suits and lobb ying i urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to continue the important work of the legal services corporation"], [0.01138150691986084, 0.9886184930801392, 1, "i am refer the

because i believe it is important for members of this body from time to time to step away from the pressures of daily debate and reflect more broadly on the issues before us no issue requires that kind of sober reflection more urgently than this crisis in our foreign policy i rise as a critic of current unitedstates policy while proclaiming a commitment to peace and democracy the administration continues to pursue a policy that by its very nature is incapable of securing either of these goals for the administrations policy is essentially a military policy based on a narrow ideological conception of the regions problems and prospects it is a policy that refuses to acknowledge the mistakes of the past and fs thus left without a realistic vision of the future while calling for demilitarization and an end to aggression in central america the administration continues to place arms at the disposal of some of the most ruthless forces in the region the united states has provided hundreds of milions of dollars in military aid to el salvador to a government which even ourown ambassador acknowledges continues flagrant violations of its own citizens human rights todays ap will provide a graphic and all too familiar example la plorida el salvador masita ruiz says the killers came at midnight firing machine guns and swinging machetes as she and her children lay quivering in their clay hovel the gang dragged seven screaming peas ants from neighboring huts stabbed them in the chest and face and hacked them to death in an orgy of blood before departing ms ruiz and about 12 other witnesses told an ap reporter i heard the screams and the shots she said the next day they found their bodies all cut up the heavily armed gang had stormed into the 600acre cooperative farm in la flo ta where ms ruiz and about 300 other peasants lived the date was nov 20 nobody knows who did it and why but the atrocity bore the markings of rightwing paramilitary gangs which terrorize civilians to keep them from associating with leftist rebels after the murders work stopped at la florida in the foothills of santa ana province 52 miles northwest of san salvador frightened villagers began to flee ms ruiz said she gathered her 10 children and went to live with relatives 12 miles away in santa ana city where she was interviewed the victims between 29 and 59 years old appeared to have been felled by a machete whack on the nape of the neck the la florida villagers said the killers slit the throats of three victims repeatedly stabbed them sliced off the nose of another victim and sexually mutilated him stunned negihbors buried the bodies a few days latter in makeshift graves by the road side where the victims died caked pools of blood marked the killing ground an officer at the santa ana army garrison denied the army was involved in the killing police authorities said they had no information and refused to elaborate unitedstates military aid to honduras has multiplied in the last year and threatens to destabilize a country where newly formed democratic institutions are struggling to maintain autonomy from the traditionally overpowering military costa rica a democratic nation that has long foresworn the desire for a large standing army has been pressured by the united states to strengthen its arsenal now president reagan raises the specter of military aid to guatemala a country whose brutal military regimes have earned it the condemnation of the world the folly of this policy can be illustrated by examining some of the events of the past year evidence has been accumulating fot nearly a year showing that the united states is involved in an escalating covert campaign a secret war aimed at nicaragua earlier this year the washington post reported that president reagan authorized 19 million for the cia to advise train and arm paramilitary forces along the honduran nicaraguan border at a minimum and without going beyond what the administration has cnceded the purpose of this operation was to stop the flow of arms across that border and to engage in hit and run raids to sabotage to harrass the nicaraguan government there is reason to fear that the operation has gone far beyond that it has brought the united states into a working arrangement with former members of president somozas national guard who are committed to the violent overthrow of the nicaraguan government this is a sordid alliance with people who promise a massacre in nicaragua and who boast that when they return to power there will be bodies from the border to managua the uprooted the wounded and the dead in nicaragua bear painful witness to the thrust of this campaign scores of nicaraguans have been killed and others have fled the region as guerrilla bands sweep down on isolated villages although still abetted by the united states the actions of these paramilltary forces have gained momentum beyond unitedstates control let us be clear unitedstates support for covert activities against nicaragua endangers not just the security of nicaragua but of the united states it poses issues with respect to the united states actual interest in central america and with respect to the process of forming unitedstates foreign policy to oppose unitedstates support for these covert activities is not to proclaim that the nicaraguan government is without problems and there clearly is a need for that government to encourage economic and political pluralism it is merely to proclaim that unitedstates policy in the region should not be formed through the implications of covert activities these activities commit us to a specific foreign policy that has never been openly defended and supported and whose outcome cannot be guided by our own democractic institutions a few days ago congress voiced vigorous dissent from this policy by voting unanimously to prohibit funding to any paramilitary group for the purpose of overthrowing the government of nicaragua i would like to ex press my admiration to mr harkin and others for thel leadership on this issue and to mr boland chairman of the select committee on intelligence for his clear expressions of concern and his dedication to the vigorous oversight of the consequences both in tended and unintended of unitedstates covert operations this policy is not just an isolated case rather it displays in microcosm the fundamental flaws of unitedstates policy throughout the region the united states may have started with a limited goalto end the alleged flow of cubansupplied arms across the honduran nicaraguan border but to do this required an alliance with groups like the somoscitas who have an agenda of their own we have thus become accomplices to acts of aggression against nicaragua and allies of groups committed to unmitigated cruelties this pattern has been repeated again and again as in the guise of fighting a communist threat the united states stakes its prestige on repressive military regimes whose actions we cannot endorse control or even mnbderate instead of heeding the lessons of past and present errors in unitedstates policy the administration seems determined to repeat them this is nowhere more evident than in president reagans recent embrace of guatemalas gen rios montt if the administration resumes military aid to guatemala it will not on1 be flaunting an explicit agreemenc to obtain congressional approval beforehand it will be ignoring the overwhelming evidence concerning the atrocities committed by the guatemalan government in guatemalas countryside rios montt has adopted a sophisticated and ruthless counterinsurgency campaign including a scorchedearth policy that destroys the base of rural livelihood and forces the peasants to flee the country or to camps under military control amnesty international estimates that 2 600 civilians have died in massacres since rios montt came to power americas watch has charged that by adopting a policy of total war and by abandoning the rule of law the rios montt government has become responsible for the consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights in guatemala on the mere promise that rios montt will announce electoral laws president reagan extols the guatemalan leaders commitment to democracy yet since july 1 guatemala has been under an officially declared state of seige which prohibits political and union activity requires private gatherings to be approved by the defense minister allows military authorities to detain anyone suspected of disturbing public order permits home searches without a warrant places severe restrictions on the press and creates special military tribunals to try those accused of violating the state of siege neither the promise of elections nor elections themselves will guarantee peace or even democracy to guatemala guatemala has had elections before for 30 years these have been controlled by the military and ridden with fraud in the past decade political opponents of the left and center have been mercilessly eliminated to talk of including a broad spectrum of participants in the electoral process is to ignore guatemalas past and present conditions have we forgotten that last march rios montt came to power by deposing a military leader chosen through just such an electoral process have we forgotten that only a year ago the state department assured us these elections would be a democratic solution for guatemala if the united states provides military aid to rios montt now it will only feed the climate of violence and intimidation which poisons the prospects for democracy in guatemala again the guatemalan case is not an isolated one but has broader implications that go to the heart of our understanding of democracy democracy cannot be reduced to a simple formula or to the simple ritual of elections it must rise from the hearts minds and experience of the people themselves it cannot be imposed by fiat from above we in the united states must never fall to recall that our own route to democracy was not without struggle or bloodshed and that the building of our own democratic institutions was not accomplished in a year or even a decade while expressing satisfaction with a mere skeleton of democratic procedures the administration has wasted opportunities for a genuine political solution to the conflicts of the region and has discarded chances to play a role in a concrete peace process last spring when mexican president lopez portillo offered to serve as an intermediary among the conflicting factions throughout the region the reagan administration let the offer die after a few meetings between our secretary of state and the ivexican foreign minister this fall when the presidents of mexico and venezuela made a unique joint appeal to president reagan and the heads of state of honduras and nicaragua the united states showed only rhetorical interest instead the administration quickly used a meeting of central american governments which did not include nicaragua mexico or venezuelato endorse its own conditions for dialog and declared this to be the only future forum for considering peace proposals i have long believed that regional cooperation provides the key to resolving the problems of central america countries such as mexico and venezuela are far better equipped than the united states to understand the particularities of each country and to bring together the forces necessary to secure a lasting peace the events of the last year have underscored this clearly and the administration has yet to provide a convincing rationale for ignoring and undercutting these promising peace initiatives recently there have been some auspicious signs from the administration much was gained from the presidents trip to latin americahis new respect for the individuality of each nation and his emphasis on the overriding importance of economic development i hope these themes will guide unitedstates policy in the future like many of my colleagues i have the deepest respect for george shultz whose habits of careful decisionmaking and consensus planning promise great change in our attitudes to central america secretary shultz needs and deserves time time to slowly move unitedstates policy from the ideological rut plowed by secretary haig time to implement changes of policy in a way that does not produce abrupt and unsettling tilts instead of secure progress nonetheless the administration continues to display a peculiarly onesided ability to see and support progress while mere promises of future elections make the guatemalan regime a friend of democracy fully implemented land reform programs in nicaragua evidently mean nothing while meagerly substantiated accusations of human rights abuses in nicaragua make the sandinistas the regions leading proponent of genocide the continued documented massacres in guatemala are chalked up apparently to reasons of state let us be honest and straightforward few regimes in central america are without their problems the ability of the united states to perceive subtle distinctions and support shades of progress is the key to a mature for eign policy but these subtleties must be carefully defined carefully supported and applied uniformerly or unitedstates policy becomes blind support for any regime cloaked in anticommunism the united states must be able to see and support progress on the left as well as the right and it has to be said on the left perhaps more than the right there is no overlooking the history of the region and given that history there is no mature foreign policy that does not recognize and address the revolutionary potential of the region the mexicans are want to say that each central american country must fact its own revolution and while i might dissent from their determinism their point is valid the history of colonialism repression and poverty in region that will find expression in radical politics democracy is the key to the regions future but the assertion of that ideal has to be wedded to a real program for helping each country on its road to democracy the united states has to find a way to remain close to and to influence countries as they move through rapid programs of social progress this is the fundamental foreign policy task for the united states

america and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure and may someday this

several other pieces of literature all aimed at promoting a unique numismatic adventuregreek olympia coins these coins are being marketed by numinvest corp a subsidiary of the parisbased international bankers lazard freres an organization that wanted to market unitedstates olympie commemorative coins as you know the house of representatives recently approved my olympic coin proposal by a vote of 302 to 84 this plan calls for the minting of two silver dollars and one gold 10dollar coin to be sold directly to the public by the mint the house vote signaled an overwhelming rejection of a rival proposal that called for the minting of 17 coins to be sold to the public through private marketers i vehemently objected to the private marketing plan because it had all the ingredients of a firstclass ripoff too many coins issued with nontraditional face values a prohibitively high price tag and an enormous potential for private profiteering at the expense of our olympic athletes if numinvests greek venture is any indication of how they would have approached the marketing of our olympic commemorative coins my suspicions were wellfounded when i opened the greek olympia coins brochure i was immediately struck by the slick packaging there is absolutely no way to deny itthis is an impressive brochure the photographs are clear the layout bold and the text of the copy persuasive it is filled with reference to the history of the modern olympics and their greek heritage indeed the designs for the coins shown in this brochure were based on ancient works of art after perusing the leaflet a bit longer i decided to look more closely at the information on the coins themselves and this is where the story really gets interesting this pamphlet merely describes the first series of coinsthere are two more to come these coins can only be purchased in sets of either three silver or two gold coins so if you want to buy just one coin you are out of luck although the brochure contains quotes like these coins have already cpatured the interest and admiration of experts around the world due to their historical significance beauty attention to detail and affordable price in light of their generous precious metal content these coins are hardly what you would call a good value a set of silver coins in uncirculated condition costs 64 50 the same coins in proof condition are 93 based on current exchange rates and silver prices these coins have a total face value of 13 14 and contaih bullion worth 8 31 that is an incredible markup ranging from 390 percent to 608 percent over the intrinsic value of the coins the gold coins are priced in a similar fashion they are available only in proof condition with a set of two going for 527 70 these coins have a face value of 116 and contain bullion worth 176 at todays gold prices the consumer is paying three times the intrinsic value of the coins a complete set of three silver and two gold series i coins in proof condition has a price tag of 620 70 for this sum the consumer receives 184 worth of precious metal and coins with a face value of 129 one should keep in mind that these figures represent the cost of owning only one series of coins in proof condition the actual cost of participating in the program could be considerably higher since there are three threecoin series each of proof and uncirculated silver coins and three twocoin sets of proof gold coins indeed owning a complete set of the coins would cost 2 056 the 24 coins in the complete set would have a combined face value of only 427 and contain bullion worth 577 these figures certainly refute the brochures claim that this is truly an affordable collection contrary to the marketers claim that the greek olympia coin collection is sure to be sought after by collectors as the first authentic coin issue of its kind these coins are not likely to appreqlate in value the greek olympia coins are what experts call pseudocoins that means that the coins although they officially have legal tender status are really more like medallions since their face values and technical specifications are artificial and arbitrary as a result they are not attractive to coin collectors numismatists tell me that the coins are not likely to be worth any more than their bullion value thus the consumer is paying over 2 000 for bullion worth only 577 one piece of literature states thatthree percent of the face value realized from the sale of the coins in the united states and canada will go to their respective olympic teams and athletic federations therefore as a subscriber to this collection you become in a real sense a participant in one of mans oldest and noblest traditions if someone purchased these coins in order to support our amateur athletes he or she would be sorely disappointed spending either 64 50 or 93 for one series of the silver coins would yield the unitedstates olympic committee exactly 39 cents our amateur athletes would receive 3 47 from the 527 70 one spent on a set of gold coins if one paid 2 056 for the entire series of coins the net to our athletes would be 12 75 this is hardly a cost efficient means of supporting amateur athletics i soon realized that the slick packaging was a vain attempt at disguising the shortcomings of the product itself you may in fact be wondering exactly what it is that greek olympia coins are commemorating i wondered the same thing as i was leafing through the brochure the marketers go to extreme lengths discussing the greek olympic traditionundoubtedly in the hope that you will think that these are greek olympic coins they are not these coins are being struck to commemorate the 1982 paneuropean games to be held in athens nevertheless you would have an extremely difficult time figuring this out from the sales material one piece of literature mentioned the word olympic or its derivatives 23 times there was only one reference td the paneuropean games apparently this ploy can be very effective the person who sent me this material attached a note that began enclosed find letter i received on greek olympic coins as you can see this is a clear case of misleading advertising the coins are grossly overpriced worthless to collectors useless as a means of raising money for amateur athletes and have absolutely nothing to do with the olympics given the history of privately marketed commemorative coins i should not have been surprised by this latest commemorative coin scheme throughout the entire olympic coin controversy i warned this congress about the inadvisability of allowing the consortium formed by lazard freres and occidental petroleum to market our olympic coins the greek olympia program is a clear example of that the house vote signaled a clear mandate to keep these people out of our program however although the house has endorsed a governmentrun program the full congress and the administration have not yet concurred if they retreat from the house position and favor the private marketers we may very well end up with a greek olympiatype program if that happens these marketers will make huge profits at the expense of both the american consumer and our amateur athletes"], [0.012437224388122559, 0.9875627756118774, 1, "the bill i am introducing this morning reauthorizes for fiscal year 1982 the primary housing and community

"i want to report on hearings held recently by the house small business oversight subcommittee which i cha r on todays business failure epidemic and the devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9604055881500244, 0.9604055881500244, 0, "rs managers of the conference

as one of its outstanding alumnae she received her m d with honors from the toprated tufts medical school dr ferebee began her career in medicine in the southeast section of washington where she became very active in civic and social work since religion has played such an important role in black life it is especially fitting to reflect upon the struggles and the accomplishments of the founder of the black church in northern communities negroes went furthest along the line of establishing independent churches the best example of this trend can be found in the work of bishop richard allen and his followers in philadelphia allen organized the free african society with the help of absolomn jones and was able to organize and dedicate the bethel church in 1794 in 1799 bishop asbury

many of us would like to claim bold leadership in addressing the issue of cutting government spending we cannot we are following the orders of our constituents who preceded us on this issue we now have the responsibility to carry out those orders congress own committee funding is a good place to start i support the 10percent reduction it is a significant cut yet it would not ii 1091 cripple any necessary committee action we know that some committees and subcommittees should be cut even more others should be cut less or not at all as wielders of the ax we must make discriminate chops statistics documenting the growth of government spending are so numerous as to strain our capacity for retention some point to the growth of congressional staff as a prime example of the ballooning bureaucracy well it is true congressional staff growth and the increase in committee funding levels over the past 10 years is well documented by figures the figures however only address the symptoms the disease itself remains we need to be wary of the quick cure and if we are to be responsive to the budgetcutting demands of our constituents we must look beyond the figures documenting congressional stnff growth to the reasons for this growth there is where the doctoring is really needed one reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the burgeoning bureaucracy in the executive branch executive branch personnel and funding levels have increased enormously over the past two decades new programs have been instituted with corresponding new staffs task forces have been established to study specific problems old programs have been expanded and staffs increased to handle the work load it is quite understandable that congressional committee staffs have increased commensurately just to monitor and conduct oversight investigations of increased executive branch activity we must also cut back the executive bureaucracy president reagan has promised to reduce the size of the federal work force to reduce the size and number of federal programs i believe that he is committed to this kind of a spending cut in the federal bureaucracy when this happens it should be easier for us to also reduce the sizes and budgets of our special committee staffs responsible for doing the work generated by some of these executive agencies another important reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the legislative reorganization act of 1970 this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 320 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 328 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect there will be an attempt here today by the minority to cut committee funding even more than the substantial 10percent cut proposed by the distinguished majority leader anything more than the 10percent cut would be a severe blow to the efficiency of the house committee system the purpose for such a cut is more than simply to spend less money we know that the senate now controlled by the minority has not seen fit to cut its own committee funding to this extent we know that the senate and the white house while being budget conscious in spending levels for their own staffs are still leaving themselves sufficient funds to carry out their mandated duties efficiently at the same time though there are those who would demand that the house sustain a burden of budget cutting greater than its share to the possible detriment of its efficiency and its ability to do its job i can only assume that this effort is a partisan one designed more to hamper the effectiveness of a house still with a democratic majority than to be responsive and responsible to the budgetcutting demands of the american public our president has told us that the issue of reducing federal spending at all levels is nonpartisan our constituents tell us the issue is nonpartisan commonsense tells us the issue is nonpartisan yet the

problems it does give us a little breathing space in which we can undertake a thorough review of the mill tailings demonstration project included in the nuclear waste bill and we can then recommend

problem in the prosecution of significant federal arson cases created by the limitation in the definition of the term explosive in the offenses set forth in the explosive control act of the definition was designed to broadly define explosive to include all situations in which an explosive or material with explosive capacity was used criminally the problem that h r 6454 is designed to address is that the definition of explosive has been interpreted by several courts including the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit to be limited to the specific evil of bombing and would not apply to a case in which gasoline or a flammable liquid was used to destroy a building it is now necessary to clarify the applicability of the act where the bases for federal jurisdiction exist in a case of arson it should not make any difference how the fire started the amendment makes this clear by adding the term fire to the term explosive as a means of causing the damage to the already covered property primary responsibility will remain with state and local law enforcement this is true because the federal involvement in arson is tiny in terms of the numbers of offenses 667 out of a total of some 115 000 arsons the federal involvement is significant mainly in terms of the property damage in the cases investigated by batf 122 million out of a total of 891 million reported to the fbi about 13 7 percent of the national total arson is an area of serious criminality in our nationamounting to almost six times the number of murders and one and onehalf times the numbers of reported rapes the federal involvement is only a small part of the nations fight against arson but it must be made an effective part of the fight the net effect of h r 6454 will be to avoid the frustration of serious cases that warrant investigation and prosecution the ninth circuit case which i referred to earlier reversed the conviction in a case in which the property damage from the fire was estimated at 11 million and a los angeles firefighter was killed and 24 firefighters were injured it is estimated by the insurance industry that 1 000 lives are claimed annually by arsonists the insurance industry estimates that the losses due to arson are more like 2 billion peri year rather than the 890 million reported by the uniform rime reports fur 1 0 the department of justice and the heasury department have shown a great deal of legal ingenuity in using the explosives control act to fight the arson problem however the loophole that allows arsonists to avoid a federal conviction after an extensive federal investigation should be closed i want to conclude by pointing out that this measure would save money an arson investigation is an extremely timeconsuming and technically demanding investigation roughly 30 percent of the batfs investigations into arson are discontinued simply because there was insufficient evidence that the fire had been caused by means of an explosive this bill will eliminate that wasted investigative time timeconsuming litigation over the nature of incendiary material used to commit arson will be eliminated trialdelaying testimony concerning the explosive that caused damage or destruction will no longer tie up federal courtrooms these saving are modest but cumulatively will have a positive impact on the criminal justice system this bill has the unequivocal support of the department of the treasury it has the universal support of the insurance industry it has the strong support of the firefighting community i urge the house to pass h r"],
