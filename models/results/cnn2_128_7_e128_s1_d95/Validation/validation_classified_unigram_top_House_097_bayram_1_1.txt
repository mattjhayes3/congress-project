access to health care that is access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"], [0.04105234146118164, 0.04105234146118164, 0, "i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for

honorable chalmers wylie of ohio the ranking minority member of the subcommittee i would also like to thank all of the members of the subcommittee for their efforts to help get the reported bill to the floor today we are considering a bill to provide a costofliving increase in benefits for veterans who were disabled as a result of their milltary service and for the widows and orphans of veterans who died of serviceconnected causes the bill is designed to assist these individuals to make sure that their level of benefits is not eroded by the ravages of inflation the bill would provide an average 7 4 percent increase effective october 1 i wish to assure you and my colleagues that the funding level contained in this bill does not exceed the targets established in the first concurrent budget resolution additionally it is not inflationary in that it simply provides a costofliving increase based on the anticipated rise in the consumer price index between 1982 the legislation is necessary since the serviceconnected program for veterans and widows is not indexed by laws serviceconnected compensation is payable to veterans who suffer from a disease or disability incurred during service the percentage of disability for a specific disability is assigned by the veterans administration that agency has established a schedule for rating disabilities which is the guideline for measuring the degree of disability compensation is paid for disabilities at ratings of 10 percent 20 percent and so forth up to 100 percent the rate of compensation payable for each percentage of disability is established by law additional compensation is payable for the loss of a limb blindness and other severe disabilities an additional dependency allowance is payable to veterans with a rating of 30 percent or more for a spouse minor children or dependent parents historically the congress has increased compensation rates whenever there has been an appreciable increase in the costofliving index since the rates are not indexed to the consumer price index by law this is necessary to insure that inflation does not erode july 297 1 982 the purchasing power of those drawing compensation and dic benefits widows and children of veterans who die of causes determined to be service connected are entitled to monthly payments of dependency and indemnity compensation the purpose of this benefit is to provide partial compensation to the designated survivors for the loss in financial support sustained as the result of the serviceconnected death income and need are not factors in determining a surviving spouses or childs entitlement since the nation assumes in part the legal and moral obligation of the veteran to support the spouse and children payments of dic for surviving spouses are determined on the basis of the veterans service pay grade rnd range from 415 monthly for the surviving spouse of an e1 to 1 061 monthly fbr the surviving spouse of an 010 surviving spouses are entitled to an additional 48 monthly for each child it is well established that the congress has placed the very highest priority on the payment of compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation benefits to eligible veterans and survivors the bill also contains several program changes first it would provide entitlement to va compensation to members of the senior reserve officers training corps if during military training camp a participant suffers a disabling injury my very capable colleague from south dakota the honorable thomas a daschle called to our attention the fact that where an rotc member suffers a fatal injury during summer camp his widow is entitled to dependency and indemnity compenss tion dic but if he is seriously injured and does not die he is not eligible to receive benefits from the veterans administration the individual is only eligible for federal employees compensation under section 8104 of title 5 united states code which is substantially lower than va compensation the bill would correct this inequity the bill would also increase the compensation rate for certain blinded veterans by equalizing benefits for totally blinded veterans without light perception with those who have suffered the enucleation of the eyes or deformity or scarring an increased compensation rate would also be payable to veterans who suffer from serviceconnected blindness in both eyes 5 200 visual acuity or less and who additionally have incurred the serviceconnected loss or loss of use of one hand or one foot this increased compensation is considered to be warranted because the loss of an extremity has a greater impact on a blinded veteran than on an individual who has not lost his or her sight the honorable christopher h suirru of new jersey the honorable albert lee smith of alabama and the honorable joseph f smith of pennsylvania addressed these issues in h r 6154 and h r 6155 the bill wculd reinstate the 300 burial allowance for certain wartime veterans whose remains are unclaimed and whose estates do not contain sufficient resources to defray the cost of the funeral and burial of the deceased under the provisions of public law 9735 the omnibus reconciliation act of 1981 the 300 nonserviceconnected burial allowance was terminated for many veterans exceptions to this discontinuance were veterans who were drawing va pension or compensation benefits at time of death or who died in a va facility following the adoption of the reconcillation act last year the press publicized accounts of many bodies being held in county and city morgues when no funds or next of kin were available to provide a proper burial investigation of this situation revealed that the press reports were greatly exaggerated however committee investigation revealed that some cases did exist and action is warranted to make certain that the unclaimed body of a wartime veteran is not buried in a paupers grave this provision of the bill corrects the oversight which occurred by the enactment of public law 9735 additionally it would authorize payment of the burial allowance in cases where a veteran dies in a va contract nursing home the provisions of section 903 a title 38 united state code authorize payment of the 300 nonserviceconnected burial allowance whenever death occurs in a va facility to which the deceased was properly admitted for almost 20 years the va has followed an interpretation by its general counsel that contract nursing care constituted care in a va facility for purposes of eligibility for burial benefits public law 9735 provided that the benefit would no longer be payable unless the deceased veteran was in receipt of compensation or pension or unless he died in a va facility the congress relying on the long standing interpretation of current law on this issue did not place any limit on deaths in either a vaowned facility or in a contract facility earlier this year the va general counsel issued an opinion reversing an earlier opinion issued almost 20 years ago that death in a contract nursing home did not constitute death in a va facility for purposes of establishing eligibility for burial benefits in his latest opinion he did not consider the issue of congressional ratification of the earlier decision manifested by legislation enacting a number of amendments and restrictions placed on payment of burial benefits therefore there is no alternative but to seek legislative remedy the bill would further authorize the administrator to furnish a flag to the next of kin of certain persons buried in a national cemetery public law 9343 which became effective june 18 1973 extended the privilege of being buried in a national cemetery to nonveterans in certain instances so designated by the administrator this would usually involve an individual who performed outstanding and meritorious service to this nation this provision of the bill would authorize the administrator to provide a burial flag to any distinguished individual so honored by burial in a national cemetery at the request of the department of defense the bill would provide that the position of superintendents of national cemeteries administered by the department of the army need not be restricted to only those who have been disabled in the line of duty prior to 1973 the department of the army administered 84 national cemeteries and required that each superintendent meet the serviceconnected disability requirementa requirement which has been in effect since 1948 when 82 of the cemeteries were transferred to the veterans administration under the provisions of the national cemeteries act of 1973 the act removed the requirement that superintendents for national cemeteries administered by the veterans administration be disabled veterans it continued the disability requirement however for superintendents of army national cemeteries the army anticipates extreme difficulty in filling future vacancies for the superintendent positions at arlington and the soldiers home national cemetery this bill would enable the army to avoid that difficulty the bill further contains a technical amendment with respect to entitlement of dependency and indemnity compensation under current law a surviving spouse or child is eligible for these benefits only if the veteran was at the time of death in receipt of compensation for a disability rated as total for 10 years prior to death or for 5 years and continuously from the date of discharge under this amendment a survivor would be eligible for benefits at dic rates if the veteran was entitled to receive compensation at the total rate during t e requisite period it is intended to create entitlement in survivors when the veteran was not assigned a total disability rating for the requisite duration because of va error at the request of the veterans administration the bill would remove the bar against payment of servicemens group life insurance sgli and veterans group life insurance vgli proceeds in the event a claim is filed more than 4 years after the insureds death the bill also clarifies that such proceeds may not escheat to a state the bill enhances the quality of care for veterans in medical facilities operated by the veterans administration by insuring the provision of such care and necessary related services by federal employees this provision is contained in the bill as a result of an amendment offered by my very distinguished colleague the honorable marvin leath of texas a proposed revision to omb circular a76 mandates ronversion to contract for those services with 25 or less employees without requiring cost comparison studies to ascertain the cost effectiveness of such conversions the bill specifies that va services not be contracted out unless the administrator after giving proper consideration to the recommendation of the chief medical director determine it is not in the best interest of the veterans and the agency to do so high quality health care for veterans continues to be one of the committees highest priorities and this is demonstrated by the fact that h r 6315 which is identical to this provision in the bill was cosponsored by 28 members of the committee the bill also complies with the reconciliation instructions to the committee on veterans affairs contained in the first concurrent budget resolution it contains several program changes which if enacted would realize savings totaling 169 7 million in budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 1983 185 9 million in fiscal year 1984 and 195 million in fiscal year 1985 the congressional budget office has advised us that the savings will be 400 000 more than what is shown in the body of our committee report and this amount is reflected in the above figures the bill contains the following costsavings provisions first rounding down pension and compensation benefit checks to the next lower dollar issuing pension checks in even dollars would realize savings of 10 8 million in fiscal year 1983 10 4 million in fiscal year 1984 and 10 1 million in fiscal year 1985 rounding down compensation and dic benefits to the nearest whole dollar would save 18 3 million in fiscal year 1983 18 5 million in fiscal year 1984 and 18 6 million in fiscal year 1985 second amending the definition of a dependent child for pension purposes to exclude college students over the age of 18 this would be phased in over 4 years to protect current student beneficiaries this would save 13 4 million in fiscal year 1983 18 1 million in fiscal year 1984 and 21 7 million in fiscal year 1985 third delaying payment of compensation and pension benefits until the first full month of entitlement rather than from the effective date of the award by postponing the start of the payment period but not the effective date itself for purposes of other va rights savings in the compensation account would be 9 million in fiscal year 1983 10 million in fiscal year 1984 and 10 4 million in fiscal year 1985 pension savings are estimated at 19 8 million in fiscal year 1983 20 7 million in fiscal year 1984 and 22 million in fiscal year 1985 fourth changing the effective dates of reductions and discontinuances of compensation dic or pension by reason of a veterans change in dependency status from the end of the year to the end of the month in which the event occurred savings for compensation would be 1 4 million in fiscal year 1983 1984 and 1985 savings for pension would be 1 8 millon in fiscal year 1983 2 1 million in fiscal year 1984 and 2 5 million in fiscal year fifth terminating the correspondence training program this would realize savings of 5 6 million in fiscal year 1983 4 9 million in fiscal year 1984 and 4 2 million in fiscal year sixth imposing a 0 5 percent user fee on va loans the average fee would be about 285 with an exemption for serviceconnected veterans drawing compensation benefits under chapter 11 of title 38 united states code savings would be approximately 89 6 million in fiscal year 1983 99 8 million in fiscal year 1984 and 104 1 million in fiscal year 1985 mr speaker the above program changes meet our reconciliation requirements for the next 3 years although the majority of these proposals will have minimal impact upon exitsing benefiti and services i personally have reservations about the imposition of a users fee on va loans i wish to point out however that it is only temporary the authority to collect such fee will expire on september 30 i think it only fair that we do it this way the fee should only be paid during a period of time when we are in a severe economic slump it is my understanding that certain tax provisions considered by the senate last week in their tax bill are also temporary in nature in particular i refer to senator helms amendment that the additional tax on tobacco expire october 1 1985 it is my belief that we should not continue to impose a users fee on veterans many of whom served during wartime applying for va loans once the country reaches a measure of economic recovery again i would like to point out that this bill will have no inflationary impact and is well within the budget authority and outlays as contained in the first congressional budget resolution it has an overall cost of 539 in budget authority and 486 in outlays for fiscal year 1983 this bill is vital to our serviceconnected veterans and i urge that it be adopted"], [0.05267535522580147, 0.05267535522580147, 0, "i rise in support of h r 3115 the

blessings and opportunities every day my friends and neighbors in the fifth district love this great country of ours with every fiber of their being and the many thousands of war veterans from southeastern and southcentral kentucky testify to the deeply held conviction in our part of the state that it is better to die on our feet as free men than to live tamely on our knees as slaves to the enemies of freedom and human dignity and while memorial day is a day of remembering our war dead we must never fall to express our deep appreclation for and our gratitude to the many veterans across

am proud to be fighting for them here in congress to make sure they get the benefits and services they deserve memorial day is a time to honor but also a time to reflect what does the sacrifice of our countrymen mean for us first we must never take our freedom for granted the fact that a country dedicated to peace and freedom has become embroiled in two world wars as well as korea and vietnam

proposal the reagan budget has such a high deficit such excessive cuts in programs for the disadvantaged elderly and women and such exorbitant waste in defense that it is not worthy of serious consideration so the choice is between the jones budget and the latta budget let me start off by pointing out what is wrong with both of these budgets first and most serious both contain unconscionably large deficits over the next 3 years each proposal calls for more than 225 billion more in spending than in receipts our economy cannot tolerate a budget this far out of balance for this long but even on this score the jones budget is preferable since it plots a more direct path to a balanced budget the fiscal year 1983 deficit in jones is 39 percent of the fiscal year 1983 deficit orn the other hand in the latta budget the fiscal year 1985 deficit is 54 percent of the fiscal year 1988 deficit second both contain excessive defense spending over the next 3 years the jones budget increases the defense function outlays by 154 billion over 1982 levels while the latta budget increases those outlays by 174 billion far more damaging to the prospect of a balanced budget in the future is the fact that the latta budget increases budget authority by over 200 billion during the same period clearly some increase in defense spending is needed to maintain our military preparedness increases of the type proposed in these budgets are entirely unnecessary and lead to increased waste fraud and mismanagement the latta budget fails to assert any critical scrutiny to any part of the pentagons plans every weapons system no matter how unnecessary unworkable or expensive is funded in full the presidents plans for civil defense chemical warfare and nuclear weapons are supported with eyes shut and no questions asked the jones budget is better on defense while still shifting too high a portion of our federal resources to function 050 deciding between these two budgets is much easier on the domestic side the latta budget recomputes current year spending in such a way that extended unemploym nt benefits housing interest rate subsidies and urgent supplemental appropriations cannot be accommodated the republicans say they want to fund these programs so we are left to wonder whether the latta budget eliminates crucial recessloncaused spending or whether we are meant to take the proposal with a grain or two of salt the policy decisions for the future are clear the latta budget reduces the deficit and funds insufficiently increases in medicare and student loans by stealing money from programs helping the poor the elderly women the unemployed and the hungry unemployment benefits and employment and training are cut by over 1 billion in the latta budget food stamps and child nutrition are cut by a larger amount aid to family with dependent children and medicaid are cut nearly as much education health legal services energy space transportation are all slashed by huge amounts while the jones budget does make some real cuts in programs which can be tightened up it does not decimate basic social programs in the way the latta budget does in the civil service area the latta budget doubles the cutback in federal employment which was provided for in the previous data budget instead of eliminating 20 000 jobs the latta budget would abolish 40 000 further the latta budget igxiores the clear vote of the house for a 5percent pay raise during oui prior consideration of the budget and instead imposes a 4lpercent cap the latta budget would greatly reduce the amount of compensation which injured federal workers receive it mandates significant cuts in the civil service retirement system the latta budget seems to be based on the theory that the best way to frame a budget is to attack the weakest and support the strongest strong interest groups like veterans ancd defense contractors get generous treatment from latta the old poor injured and

participation in the life of our society of americas citizens with physical or mental disabilities in recognition of this challenge a group of concerned citizens formed the unitedstates council for

international year of disabled persons was established by the direction of the white house domestic policy staff to coordinate unitedstates policies to maximize cooperation and minimize overlap in federal programs it seeks to promote awareness of the needs of disabled in identifying and developing all federal programs the council and the interagency committee hope to build on the progress that has already been made toward establishing americas leadership as a defender of human and civil rights and as a nation advanced in biomedical research accident and disease prevention and technologicial application during the 1970s disabled americans began to see physical barriers come down ramps and curb cuts are more common now transportation systems adapted for persons with disabilities are providing increased mobility and independence education and employment opportunities are expanding for both the physically and mentally handicapped medical and technological breakthroughs and

disabled persons in my washington officeone who is confined to a wheelchair from a sporting accident and one who lost a limb in the vietnam war for anyone who knows the crowded conditions that capitol hill staff serve under they know that there is not much room for those of us who can walk normally to maneuver and certainly much less for a person in a wheelchair there were some skeptics among my staff members who were not sure that it would be possible to accommodate disabled persons under those circumstances there were others however including me who felt that it was all simply a matter of attitudeif you want it done you do it the first barrier that we had to overcome was to find handicapped housinghousing that is accessible to a wheelchair i must say that i have been disappointed to find such a lack of handicapped housing in the nations capital in fact the young man who is confined to a wheelchair has been forced to begin work later than he wanted because it took him so long to find handicapped housing the second barrier we had to overcome was finding appropriate office furniture that would accommodate a wheelchair property supply said that they had no desks for a handicapped person we have also worked that out i must admit however that it has been the drive and perseverence of the young staffer who is disabled more than anything else that has enabled him to

3603 this amendment which is based on the reagan administrations proposal would lower the parity floor on dairy price supports from 75 to 70 percent of parity it would give the secretary of agriculture authority to allow the parity level to drop below 70 percent when government expenditures exceed 750 million finally it would eliminate the semiannual adjustment in the support price while retaining the current dollar level of the support price at 13 10 per hundredweight proponents of this measure argue that price supports must be held down in order to reduce dairy surpluses and cut government spending the president feels that it is fair to ask dairy farmersto make this sacrifice for the sake of the national economy furthermore he and agriculture secretary block claim their proposal preserves an adequate price support program for dairy producers i disagree with the president and his supporters on every point their proposal will not result in an adequate program on the contrary it will drive many farm families out of business their proposal is not the only nor it is the best way to reduce dairy surpluses the administration has badly mismanaged dairy exports has failed to actresponsibly on limiting imports and has cut back on important domestic nutrition programs which utilize milk and milk products finally the amendment is unfair after having provided huge tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in this country how can this administration and this congress blame farm families for rising budget def icits before addressing each of these points in more detail i would like to review some of the history behind this issue four years ago the congress placed a temporary 80 percent of parity floor on milk price supports this relatively highparity floor was enacted to return stability to the dairy market previous lower support levels had resulted in extreme fluctuations in supply and price which hurt both producers and consumers the 80percent floor along with the semiannual adjustment of the support price worked remarkably well during the first 2 years the support price was generally even with or below the market price and the program acquired a relatively small quantity of dairy productsjust slightly above that required for domestic and foreign nutrition programs in 1979 congress reaffirmed the 80percent floor then a severe recession overtook farming in 1980 net farm income dropped 25 percent and this year is expected to rise only to 1979 levels return on investment for farmers in 1980 averaged 2 4 percent this problem was compounded by the restrictions placed on grain exports to the soviet union which helped keep grain prices low dairy farmers did have an adequate pricesupport program this had the unfortunate consequence however of encouraging farmers to switch their resources from other commodities to milk production and encouraging dairy farmers to expand their herds against this background it is not difficult to understand how we arrived at our current situation of course we have a surplus of dairy products when milk is virtually the only major commodity that yields farmers even a marginal profit we can expect farmers to produce a lot of milk unfortunately the administrations solution is to eliminate the profit in dairy farming rather than looking for ways to make other commodities more profitable however it is not accurate to portray dairy farmers as growing rich at the expense of consumers and taxpayers i represent one of the largest dairy districts in the country and i know that this is simply not the case again if we look at recent history we find that dairy farmers work long hours for low wages and their income has not kept pace with increases in the costs of production we also find that dairy products are among the best values available to todays consumers dairy farmers must make huge investments in land buildings equipment and livestock they must be on the job every day of the year their days are long and their work requires much knowledge and skill what do they earn for this effort in 1980 with price supports at 80 percent of parity dairy farmer income averaged 2 89 per hour according to university of wisconsin researchers that is 15 percent below the minimum wage unfortunately that 2 89 will look awfully good if this amendment passes farmers already gave up last aprils adjustment of the support price and it has fallen from 80 t~o 72 percent of parity now the gentleman from massachusetts offers the white house amendment which will give the secretary authority to hold the support price steady for the foreseeable futureat least the next fewv years some argue that because the dollar level of price supports cannot go below 13 10 we are not really cutting price supports this is true if production costs remain constant but as every farmer and businessman knows that day is far off last year dairy production costs rose 10 3 rcent meanwhile the prices received by farmers rose only 7 1 percent undcr this amendment those prices would hardly rise at all for consumers duiry prices have not increased as rapidly as other prices from march 1980 to march 1981 general consumer prices rose 10 6 percent while dairy prices rose only 10 1 percent and as i said the prices received by farmers rose only about 7 1 percent of greater significance is the fact that milk prices have declined in relation to the general wage rate the minutes of work required to purchase a gallon of milk have declined 44 percent over the past three decades the period during which price supports have been kept a 75 percent of parity or more so we can see that the american dairy farmer is not getting rich at the expense of the taxpayer and consumer on the contrary with limited government help he has kept his head above water by working long hours and improving productivity as i stated earlier the points raised in support of the gentlemans amendment are open to question for example the administration and the gentleman from massachusetts claim they are proposing an adequate program i disagree this amendment will cost dairy farmers over 1 billion annually when compared to the 75percent floor proposed by the house agriculture committee make no mistake about it we will be driving family farms out of business with this amendment large operators may be able to weather these losses but a great many small family farms will not the administration tells us this is the only way to lower dairy surpluses meanwhile the white house has stalled on imposing import controls on casein which displaced 333 million pounds of domestic nonfat dry milk in 1980 the administration has also cut important domestic nutrition programs which utilize dairy products and most disturbing is the fact the the president has given a foreign country new zealand veto power over further sales of government butter stocks overseas in each instance the administration has rejected other options for disposing of our surpluses finally there is a question of equity i certainly agree that the 1 886 billion the commodity credit corporation will spend this year on the dairy program is a lot of money but so is the 6 billion in tax breaks this congress gave to those earning over 100 000 in 1982 the same could be said for the 12 billion tax breaks given to the oil industry and the 25 billion given to big business by fiscal mr chairmar we must balance the budget but why are we putting farm families out of business re the same wve are giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society the american dairy farmers had already accepteid a cut in price supports from 80 to 75 percent of parity the gentlemans amendment will for all practical purposes eliminate the parity floor on the support price i hope that my colleagues will reject the amendment and give the family farm a chance to survive"], [0.8928129225969315, 0.10718707740306854,

exists between the united states and its trading partners the problem is one that exists because we have tried to promote free trade in general though our colleague from new york has pointed out that our rhetoric is better than our performance and some of our trading partners have clung to advantages that we gave them in the postwar era creating clear disadvantages in many areas to expand trade of american goods abroad this is especially true in the area of agriculture and while i am totally in agreement that this problem existsand the problem has been alluded to over and overthis bill in no way addresses that problem in fact this bill will compound that problem because this bill simply says do not open up your markets to unitedstates products as we have heard over and over and over today there is no vehicle in this bill to promote the openmarket objective this bill says we are going to force you to produce a substantial amount of a significant productautomobiles motor vehiclesthat are sold on the american market in the united states it seems to me that there are several points missed and i would like to try to go through them very rapidly and make the points as clear as i can no 1 this bill will not create a single job even if no nation in the world reciprocates if no nation in the world raises its trade barriers in response there will still be no net job impact now why do i say that i say that because we are operating under flexible exchange rates the values of the dollar on the world market relative to other currencies is set by supply and demand so if we come in with a domestic content bill and we reduce the import of japanese automobiles and we havethem built here to the extent that they are produced then there will be a strengthening of the value of the dollar because we are buying less abroad but as the value of the dollar goes up the competitiveness of american goodsone out of every 6 american jobs is in exportswill decline so that for every united auto worker job that we save even if no other nation initiates a trade war responding to our first salvo there will be an american job in another industry that will be destroyed so this is not a jobcreation bill this is a jobtransfer bill and the problem is who are we taking jobs away from we are taking jobs away from industries that are growing and that are competitive and that represent the future of our nation in the 1980s and the 1990s and we are giving jobs and protecting jobs in an industry which has not stayed competitive and i am not going to say the whole fault is with management or the whole fault is with the united auto workers but the plain truth is that the american people have not been forced to buy these japanese automobiles they bought them because they were good automobiles and because they have competed and because they were given value at a given price but in tranferring jobs we still do not preserve the jobs that we save by taking other american jobs away decehaber 15 1982 what has happened to the nations that have followed this route what has happened in britain with protectionism what has happened in britain is that as they have subsidized as they have protected their heavy industry the very problems that made them noncompetitive to begin with have not been solved in fact the problems have gotten more difficult our trade problems in automobiles represent a means to a solution not the problem in and of itself it forces the unions it forces management and it forces government to change the rules of the game to make us competitive if we take away the pressure to make difficult decisions difficult decisions for presidents of labor unions difficult decisions for the president of general motors and difficult decisions for members of congress i submit that those decisions will never be made and we will be back here in 2 or 3 years with the same problems without the jobs being protected in the automobile industry but with the jobs having been destroyed in other industries we here today are speaking not just about any other nation we are talking about the policy of the worlds greatest economic power what we do is going to affect the

of 12 6 billion over 1 million people are employed in the aerospace business i think these figures show the extreme importance of the aerospace industry to our country as the gentleman from kansas pointed out unfortunately today we are seeing our leadership in this area being slowly eroded by foreign competition the challenge is of the same magnitude as the challenge that faced the automobile industry 10 years ago already the european consortium airbus industries has pushed ahead of douglas and lockheed in manufacturing widebody aircraft we lost those jobs and balance of payments and the europeans gained already the commuter aircraft market is dominated by imports from foreign countries the helicopter business is being swept by foreign competition especially the french and italians now we are seeing the japanese move into jet engine development we in congress must respond to the needs of our aerospace industry to prevent this erosion from abroad we must stop any decline into the state of disarray that we find in the automobile business as i see it there are three areas where we need to concentrate together as a government and as an industry first i think we have to get our economy in shape we must support the efforts of our president and those of us in congress who are trying to eliminate the diseases of inflation high taxes and disincentives to investment into such things as high technology in tltat regard i am hopeful that when che committee on ways and means brings forward its final tax package there will be a recognition of the importance of creating incentives for our industries to invest in research and development some kinds of tax credits or incentives need to be developed in order to encourage research in all levels of industrial activity but particularly in the area of high technology we must encourage reaching out to discover the unknown that really is the seed for future growth properity and jobs second i think we in congress must support a strong nasa aeronautics program this has been the key to industrys success over the last 50 years it provides the basic research foundation for exploring the longterm aspects of aeronautics and related technology the europeans and the japanese have been using our nasa model as a basis for their investment into high technology they are beating us at our own game if we let our industries down now the result will be quite predictable and all bad last i would suggest that we in government take a hard look at some of the roadblocks that we placed in front of aerospace exports we have to meet competition with competition i happen to think that it is important that we support the financing mechanism of the exportimport bank this allows competitive flnancing packages for aerospace industries to sell abroad in addition to that i would urge the president of the united states to ask all agencies of government to explore where they can bring to bear support for our exports at all levels but particularly in the aerospace and high technology areas the state department especially should enter into negotiations to eliminate those barriers that have been placed in front of our products in foreign countries so i support the nasa bill in my opinion this nation has reaped great benefits far and above our original investment in nasa research and development"],

register there were fewvery few people of the jewish faith people of italian or polish descent in fact few if any of the minority groups registered as republicanthere were a minute number of the labor leadership who would say a kind word for the gop and what the party stood forand certainly few of our citizens who are the backbone of our societyand of course i refer to the bluecollar workerwho then belonged to the republican party and fewer still who had a leadership position in the party the shame of it all of course is that after being responsible for electing him president the bluecollar worker more than perhaps anyone else has been stabbed in the heart by this president and his cohortsthe reward they have received from this murderous mandate yet when i joined the grand old party and

and their children it is to have the selfrespect of being able to have steady work and to look forwaid most importantly to providing their children a better life then they themselves had as they grew up some of them eventually joined the republican party for various and sundry reasonsbut certainly some of them as i felt that the twoparty system was most important and that to say the least they
