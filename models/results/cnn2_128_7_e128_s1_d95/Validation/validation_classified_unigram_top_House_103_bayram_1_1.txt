members of the republican budget committee in the 8 years that i have been in congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher tas and ~her spending will stifle growth in the private eoonomy kim jobs and not reduce the deficit the cinton plan is the 1990 budget deal pan ii in super 3d with twice the tax increase i urge my coieagues to reject the big government democrat agenda and support the kasich alternative which cuts 430 biliton from the

america is paying attention to this debate because one of the most salient points that was just made was that president clinton has proposed what is called an economic stimulus package that is costing 16 5 billion and it is not even included in the budget that they are talking about all the deficit spending that is in that budget which is into the billions and billions and billions of dollars even though there is a 400 billionplus tax increase in there does not include this 16 billion socalled economic stimulus package that is filled with pork g it has got swimming pools in there for various communities around the country it has got gymnasiums in there for various communities around the country it has got parking garages in there it has got libraries in there these are things that local communities ought to pay for but taxpayers from around the country are taking care of their friends in alabama and their friends in florida and their friends in california with these porkbarrel projects and the thing that is most irksomeabout this if there is such a work is that the president has not even put it in this budget it is 16 billion more that is going to be added to the debt in addition to what this does i just heard from my colleagues this is going to increase the national debt by 586 billion over the next year i wonder how many other things we are going to have added to this debt over the next year certainly this 16 5 billion socalled economic stimulus package which i call pork package is going to be added in addition to it we have to start coining new words new definitions around here today i started one clintonomics remember reaganomics everybody criticized remember clintonomics because it is going to cost 1 4 million jobs in the next 4 to 5 years that is how many jobs we aregoing to lose at least according to most economists clintonomics and it is going to lead to a clintastrophy an economic clintastrophy find that in your lexicon if it is not there now it should be the first thing we ought to do is start addressing the problem of government spending just 10 years ago we had our first 1 trillion national debt now we are almost to 4 5 trillion in debt it took us 200 years to get to 1 trillion and less than 10 years to more than quadruple it and what are we doing instead of cutting spending we are raising your taxes more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and that is supposed to solve our problems remember that when you get your paycheck next year remember that when you pay your utility bill and you are paying 400 500 more for gas or electricity inyour home next year because that btu tax the bigtime unemployment tax we call it is going to be hitting each and every one of you the problem is this really concerns me is that the media has not really gone into the program and explained it to the american people it is no wonder to me that the people of this country want president clinton to succeed i want him to succeed but at the same time while he is succeeding i do not want to see him take the economy right down the tubes to a degree that is worse than what we have seen over the last 3 to 4 years we raised taxes in 1990 to the tune of 184 billion and what did it cost it cost us jobs and it cost us an economic recession now they are raising taxes more than double that sure we want president clinton to succeed but we want the economy to succeed even more and the way to make sure the economy succeeds and grows so that we create more jobs and do not lose them overseas is to cut government spending first that is the key government spending is out of control we brought in 500 billion in tax revenues 10 years ago now it is 1 2 trillion almost triplewhat we brought in 10 years ago yet we are still running 300 to 400 billion in red each year so raising taxes is not the answer since we raised taxes 184 billion in 1990 for every 1 in new taxes we have spent 2 70 so the problem is not that we are not getting enough revenue the problem is spending is out of control and they will not make the hard declslotis on cutting spending we had a proposal called the 2percent solution that would freeze all government spending and no more than a growth rate of 2percent per year over the previous year they would not let us even bring it out of the committee on rules to the floor that would have balanced the budget in 6 years without a tax increase that is the problem they want to raise taxes and they want to spend us into oblivion and they are going to do it unless america rises up and says no more no more the problem is they face a dilemma that benjamin franklin said the second continental congress faced and that is they have to either hang together or hang separately and they are swallowing

the administration the tax increases of 275 billion will not produce desired deficit reduction either history shows that congress spends 1 59 for every 1 collected in taxes because most of the presidents spending cuts occur in future years the tax increases imposed immediately on working americans will ony serve to feed more government spending rather than reduce the deficit i believe the american taxpayer has given enough and congress should cut spending not increase taxes i remain opposed to this type of phony deficit reduction congress tried ot in 1990 the tax increases were put

total of 40 7 cents per gallon in state and federal taxes i believe there is a better way to reduce the deficit the proper solution to spiraling deficits is to control federal spending to that end i

in comparison to what i had a front row seat for a decade of the reaganbush years and their initiatives hardly resulted in greater investment or smaller deficits when ronald reagan moved into the white house the deficit was just over 74 billion and the national debt and just under 1 billion when george bush moved out of the white house the deficit was racing paid 300 billion and the national debt stood at just over 4 trillion the test of the clinton deficit plan should not be perfection rather is should be does this plan offer a change of direction from failed trickledown economics that brought us shrinking incomes record unemployment soaring debt and more families living in poverty than in the last 40 years the clinton plan delivers that change of direction surely even given its worst assessment the clinton plan could come nowhere close to the recldess results of the past two republican administrations and what do my republican colleagues choose to do to set this situation right nothing not a single member of the party which brought us this debt was willing to begin to reverse the spend now pay later policies which this party wrought more than 40 republican members

business would be robbed by the clinton plan now the facts not a single family with a gross adjusted income under 180 000 a year will pay a penny more in income taxes need i respect that families with higher incomes will pay higher taxes as they should during the last decade the wealthy saw their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period working class families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middle class families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directly to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected

for the priesthood i was taught to believe in miracles and all of us in the michigan delegation knew that paul henry was sick but we held out hope that a miracle might happen and that the day that came would never come but now that it has i realize that the true miracle is the courage and the bravery that paul henry showed in the face of unbelievable odds and unbeatable odds and the passion with which he lived his life history tells us on the day that john kennedy died a tailor in new york city put up a sign on the door that read closed today due to death in the family that is i think how we all feel it is ike we have had a death in our family we did not see eyetoeye on every issue but i do not think there was a member of this body who was more respected and more liked than paul henry and we are all going to miss him while flying out to the funeral last month somebody asked me how he thought paul would be remembered and it struck me then that paul henry was a man of some very interesting contradictions very midwestern contradictions we know from the many causes fought right here on this house floor that he was both softspoken and persuasive selfdeprecating and proud deeply religious as mr wolf has indicated yet a firm believer in mans ability to effect his own fate politically paul was a deeply patriotic man who spoke out against flag burning a fiscal conservative who voted in favor of extending unemployment benefits a defense supporter who said no to both the mx missile and the nicaraguan contras it seemed that paul was not so concerned with the right or the left as he was with the right and the wrong he followed i think what we all strive to follow in our own public life and hopefully in our personal lives an inner compass and worked hard to make this country a better place to live and i think that is how he is going to be remembered i always got the feeling that to paul the richest life the fullest life is a life that is dedicated to helping others whether through the peace corps as he did in his early career or as a teacher as he did for many years before he came to the legislature in lansing and of course am a legislator here where he made his true mark and if paul could see us i think paying tribute to him this evening i have a feeling he would probably wonder what we were all doing standing around when there is so much work to be done i think sometimes if we had a few more paul henrys around here we would shout at each other a lot less and we would work together a lot more so our thoughts today go out to pauls wife karen and his children kar and jordan and megan their father was a credit to this institution and to our state of michigan and we will miss him in the days ahead as we lead this national through some difficult times i hope we can all show a little bit of courage and bravery and dedication that marked paul henrys entire life in the end that would be the highest tribute we can pay to him let me also say at the close of my remarks how much i appreciate and think the whole delegation appreciates the warm and touching friendship that fred upton had with paul henry fred was with him through thick and thin on thisfloor and through the very difficult battle he had at the end of his life and we all got strength from fred as he reported to us on a regular basis of pauls health and spirits and so fred thank you for going out of your way the extra mile to do something for one of the great people that have served here"], [0.9694419149309397, 0.030558085069060326, 1, "i object dunn to the vote on the ground

revolution now they say there was not i was here in 1981 i know how it all happened i know that charlie halleck of indianaspeaking of indianaonce said he was the minority leader and leader of the

first 4 years which set the pattern he had a majority in both houses in effect for his program that is why his program started why it got passed he had a net tax cut in the first 4 years of about half a trillion dollars because he had a 750 billion cut in the 1981 act and that means that one defense contractorwho by the way in 3 years with a 20 billion profit paid absolutely nothing in taxes to the unitedstates government most of which he made from the government and he also signed in real dollars the highest tax increase in history including this one in 1993 dollars 308 billion it was 200

were cut as everybody knows that was the reagan revolution was it not and the increases were in four areas they were in farm subsidies mr reagans farm subsidy which passed was exactly six times the size of mr carters farm program in 1980 by the mid1980s it was in foreign aid it was in the space program and of course it was in military procurement that is where the spending increases took place

this amendment ought to come the committee on foreign affairs ought to bring a bill to the floor of congress to address this we introduced such a bill and had over 100 cosponsors there should be

been we have to deal with what is at this moment we now have to deal with what is at this moment we now have an opportunity to talk the death and destruction that is taking place in haiti is an abomination and we need to stand up unequivocally and oppose it the drugs that are being trafficked through this situation that have impacted upon our nation are something that we need to address the refugees that are coming toward this country is an example of the deplorable set of circumstances that exist in haiti that must be addressed the issue in haiti the message we ought to be sending around the world and certainly in this region is what is more powerful the bullet or the ballot in the context of haiti the haitian people said the ballot is more powerful than the bullet and if we truly believe that then we must stand in unequivocal opposition to what is happening in haiti i applaud the international efforts that have been taken by this administration but i believe that this administration also on a unilateral basis has an opportunity to impose sanctions and bring stringent pressure on the people in haiti that are denying these human beings their human rights their human dignity their human freedom and their democratic principles remember nelson mandela just raised his hand as the president of a great nation in some part because of what this nation did unilaterally as we stood up in the world community and took a position and said that we must stand in defense of democratic principles can we do less with respect to haiti can we do less in this region we should be buoyed by the experiences of south africa we should be inspired by the installment of nelson mandela in south africa to give us a feeling that we do have a role to play make a significant contribution in elevating the international conscience with respect to this issue i would not have liked to see this amendment come to the floor in this fashion i always believe there ought to be hearings and discussions and debate and deliberation but the fact of the matter is that there is great frustration in these chambers and so we end up in this place the one gentleman has offered an amendment we offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute but at least it takes the issue off the back burner puts it on the front burner of america and allows us to discuss this issue in some clear and unequivocal terms the message that we must send to the elite and the powerful in the military in haiti is that as a great nation we cannot sit by idly and allow these things to happen the world is marching toward a more rational reality the world is marching toward some greater reality some greater commitment to human rights when israelis and palestinians can cross eons of time to shake hands to march forward into the future when nelson mendela and afrikaners can shake hands to march into the future then it is very clear that the world is on a different path we have to be on the right side of history i am concerned that we are not bringing the most stringent pressure that we can on haiti question does sanction create greater dislocation and bring pain to people in haiti the answer is yes but it can be temporary at this point the pain and the oppression are permanent the death and destruction is real on a daily basis my hope is that this separate strategy nonviolent though it be a rejection of force though it be i will stand proudly and clearly saying that i think that there is a nonviolent mechanism that we can use we have always argued in these chambers that before we talk about the use of force that we should be willing to exhaust all nonviolent means to bring pressure to achieve our commitment to democratic principles and to a commitment to human rights well we are

communities while these communities have welcomed the military families which contribute greatly to the local culture and particularly the schools they have rightfully asked the federal government to provide adequate support to the local schools to compensate for the most property tax revenues resuiting from federal ownership of local housing as the first federal education program enacted in the 1950s impact aid was fully funded by the congress during the first two deoades of its existence however as congress dramatically expanded the number and breadth of federal education programs in the 1960s and 1970s impact aid begin to compete for increasingly scarce federal dollars over the last decade impact aid has increasingly been funded below the socalled entitlement levelthe amount of revenue all schools forego due to federal ownership of local housing as result school districts like north chicago have increasingly been called upon to subsidize the education of federallyconnected children while many schools must provide either a relatively small subsidy or are able to compensate because of the large tax bases many schools have been driven literally to the brink of bankruptcy in particular school districts in highland park and north chicago in my congressional district are now providing annual multimillion dollar subsidies to the federal government through uncompensated education for federallyconnected children in the case of north chicago the school district which serves over 4 000 students recently was forced to petition for dissolution and nearly ceased operation in midschool year at the last minute the state legislature passed emergency legislation to keep the school district afloat for another year the schools financial demise was due in large measure to the failure of the federal government to fully and fairly fund the impact aid program over the last decade the establishment of the new impact aid provision which i helped to write will guarantee that communities with heavilyimpacted school districts who are making tie effort to keep the schools afloat by taxing themselves at extraordinarily high rates will get some federal reliefenough we hope to keep them in operation over the long term i want to emphasize that this funding will be provided within the budget caps in addition it does not comprise a federal handout to the school district it is

accept my proposal to provide 40 million in 1995 to fund the new socalled section f provision for heavily impacted schools this funding will ensure that the former 3 d 2 b schools and heavily impacted

talking about them running between where they are going to reduce the service one of them is the 20th busiest station in the country the other is the 4th busiest station in the country what they are suggesting is they cannot make money on those lines and when we take a look at their fare structure one of the reasons why they are not making any money on the railroad is because their fare structure does not reflect realities and is in fact designed in a way that only increases their ability to get subsidies i would suggest to members that most businessmen would probably figure out a way to take some of the busiest stations in terms of passenger travel in the country and make money off that line amtrak does not seem to be capable of doing that and instead would rather come to the congress come to state legislatures or come to state departments of transportation and say to them give me subsidy money instead of asking me to run a real business"], [0.0043659508228302, 0.4956340491771698,

to operate out of their own building and the dod claims they could save money by building a new facility because of the high rent being paid to gsa another agency of the federal government gsa claims it makes a huge profit from the military rent at the federal center because of the law that requires that they charge prevailing rates it is this kind of dumb logic that causes a lot of our government waste and inefficiency this is not a case of downsizing the workload of these units in battle creek will increase the battle creek federal center is a designated historical landmark which cannot be torn down and will require an annual cost of 400 000 to mothball after much research my michigan colleagues and i decided to introduce this bill it is gratifying to have the support of republicans and democrats freshmen and committee chairmen on a measure that will hopefully bring back some common sense and save the federal government money it is my hope that the defense base closing commission will make the fiscally correct decision in battle creek and keep dods agencies there instead of building yet another new federal building in the meantime we believe that dod should take a more direct route to save money and we propose transferring ownership of the federal center from the gsa to the dod"], [0.005236387252807617, 0.5052363872528076, 1, "mr chairmen i rise to day to share with my colleagues why i tink we can saiely bring to a dose our program of building d5 submarine launched missiles alter we buy a final 24 in fiscal year 1994 my amendment would eliminate 145 million for advanced procurement of the d5 trident l mssile most arguments you will hear about the d5 will tell you that it is highly effective and the backbone of our strategic deterrent you can agree with both of those statements and still vote for this amendmert this amendment does not say that the d5 is a bad weapon we thank the navy for a job wel done but we must recognize that in this era of budget cuts we just do not need to spend billiorns on still more missiles the current d5c4 inventory exceeds 650 and the department of defense weapon support improvement group reports that the c4s will last 23 more years or until the year no one is saying we should throw away or get dd of the 273 d5s we do or soon will have it is a fine missile we just do not need to spend billis on more my amendment would save a minimum of 4 billion and up to 11 billion in missile production costs alone the additional 7 bilion would be saved if the navy finally decided not to backflt the pacific fleet and replace the c4s currently in use the cold war has been history for over 2 years our deficit is the highest in the history of this country and yet we are told we must continue to build 24 d6s per year at a cost of 50 million per missile and 1 billion per year from now unti the year 2007 there are altematives according to the navy they need a minimum of 109 more d5 missiles after 1994 instead of borrowing billions of dollars to do this i believe it would be better to conider the following first maintain current number of warheads per missile at eight instead of reducing to four as the navy has planned we could have the same 96 warheads but would require 120 fewer d5s this would already amount to more than the 109 the pentagon has requested second reducing the d5 f est rate to the same pace as that used by the air force for its strategic missiles 3 per year would eliminate the need for 60 missiles and third any reduction in the over warhead ceiling of start ii down from 3 500 to 2 500 any time in the next 20 years would eliminate the navys requirement by up to 125 misele put simply the production of the d5 misile should be stopped after fiscal year 1994 because it is possible to maintain our start ii ceilings on submarine launched warheads with our current inventory any suggestion that we should do nothing in this area because of start ii considerations should be seen as a smokescreen to scare people away from taking a closer look at this issue the elimination of advanced procurement money from the fiscal year 1994 dod budget would save a minimum of 120 missiles and a minimum of 4 billion while retaining the same basic strategic capabilities the house armed services committee has already directed the secretary of defense to examine other options which would allow us to actieve the submarinelunched balic msse warhead levels permitted under start 14 at signilicanitly reduced cost and to report to the congressional defense commilees on these options no later than april 1 1994 as i have outlined the navy has many options to meet our strategic needs the senate armed services committee has added money to their bil toincrease lorglead funding for next year which would double d6 production rates we as members of this body need to pass this amendmert to offset this unwise action mr chaiman the cold war is over the american public knows that 650 nucleartipped submarinelaunched missiles backed up by over 200 strategic nuclear bombers and 500 deployed icbms are far more than enough to meet our needs for a strategic nuclear leterrence they also know that in tfh time of budgetary constraint more d5s are not needed for the strategic defense of this country with the production of 24 missiles in 1994 we will have a sufficient slbm inventory of c4 d5s to meet our needs into the next century the adoption of my amendment would stop producion of the d6 after fiscal year 1994 and would save the taxpayers 411 bilion america needs to reduce the deficit and not spend binos more on unneeded relics of the cold war"]]}
