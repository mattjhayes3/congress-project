with a small business owner in southside virginia who was warned by a regulator about the amount of dust coming from his property he was told to take active measures to decrease the dust coming from the dirt road leading into his sawmill this is the kind of unnecessary regulation that prevents businesses and farmers from focusing on the needs of their customers where im from dust is not a nuisance rather it is a necessary byproduct of the hard work the farmers and businesses in my rural district perform every day and these farmers and businesses should not suffer losses in production because of overbearing federal regulations these are the people who are struggling to survive to grow and to create jobs during this stalled economic recovery these are the people who cannot afford more costly and burdensome regulations handed down by washington while i applaud the epas apparent statement that it does not intend to propose a more stringent standard for coarse particulate matter

lapse leaving dhs employees without offices to work in and subjecting the federal government to lawsuits because the lessors would have no choice but to begin litigation for damages to include costs to evict and lost rent the amendment might require dhs to break current construction contracts due to a lack of funds if a new purchase or lease is required it would not permit the gsa to condemn facilities that the dhs occupies if that were necessary therefore it would force dhs to maintain occupancy until followon leases might be executed in 2013 or further down the road or alternative space could be identified and prepared for use the amendment as i read it might not permit dhs even to reconfigure its current facility space to provide seats for the new staff being hired particularly for some of these new functions that are going to require reconfiguring such as cybersecurity and intelligence missions and then we need to ask what happens if a dhs facility in d c has a fire or a flood

are good friends of mine gary williams was my neighbor for a number of years gary retired as marylands basketball coach after 22 hardworking successful college years in college park and 33 years in college coaching ranks at his retirement gary williams ranked as the fifth winningest college basketball coach in america with 668 wins stretching over his remarkable career he is also the third winningest coach in atlantic coast conference history behind two legends dean smith and mike krzyzewski gary williams inherited a struggling program and turned it into a perennial national contender under his guidance the terrapins reached the ncaa tournament 14 times 11 times consecutively won three acc regular season titles and an acc tournament championship made seven sweet sixteens two elite eights two final fours and in a memory that all terrapins still treasure and i had the opportunity of attending in atlanta won the national championship in 2002 coach williams was honored as national coach of the year in 2002 and as acc coach of the year in 2002 and 2010 but numbers alone do not capture his impact on the lives of his players or on the life of the maryland community where he stood out as a leader and as a philanthropist marylands athletic director kevin anderson correctly summed it up best when he said gary williams is a legend that is true terrapins will also miss our football coach ralph friedgen who coached his last game with the program on december 29 fittingly it was a decisive wina 5120 victory in the military bowl in washington dc the fridge as he is affectionately known also took over a struggling program and led it to notable success he guided maryland to the acc championship in his very first year as coach and of the 10 years in his tenure 7 of them ended with postseason appearances in both his first year as maryland football coach and his last he was named acc coach of the year coach friedgen won 74 games for the university of maryland brought new energy to our football program and left a lasting mark in college park he was respected by his players and looked to as a role model i was proud to call him a friend as well he too will be missed by all who love maryland who love football who love basketball and who live the principles that sports teaches both gary williams and ralph friedgen are good men and outstanding leaders and while i know

dictate to you that youre going to have to start covering medicaid constituency up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level were going to put that into law thats part of this new law obamacare and you have no choice now were going to give you a little breathing room and were going to say its not going to start for a couple of years indeed january of 2014 you have got to expand your medicaid rolls from the typical state covers 100 percent of the federal poverty level this goes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level and the boss says well well pay all of it with federal dollars for the first couple years but were going to phase that out and then oh yes guess what happens the boss adds eventually at the end of the day 60 billion to state medicaid costs and also there is a section in the bill that tells the states and its called maintenance of effort you cant change one thing that you currently do in your medicaid program to prepare yourself for this tsunami if youre covering today 185 percent of the federal poverty level you cant all of a sudden say well gosh you know were going to have to lower that to 150 percent and put some oats away and get ready for that real rainy

be there they werent eating somebody elses lunch as the expression would go they werent illegal immigrants their income wasnt too high to make them eligible for this safetynet program and of course as we all know thank goodness income from year to year can get better were still waiting for that to happen i think obamacare and some of these other policies that were seeing over the last 4 years is preventing that from happening so governor barbour would make people come and face to face verify that they were still eligible from year to year as i understand it this rule this maintenance of

taking money from american taxpayers to prop up the export businesses of large corporations companies such as boeing should be able to make sales based solely on the quality of their products and the willingness of the market to purchase those products instead these companies rely on their political connections to subsidize their businesses exim even provided enron with hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance before that companys ignominious collapse do we really want to continue funding the enrons of the world not only is it bad economics to force working americans small businesses and entrepreneurs to subsidize the exports of large corporations it is also immoral redistribution from the poor and middle class to the wealthy is the most indefensible aspect of the welfare state yet it is the most accepted form of welfare at a time when the federal government is running unprecedentedly large budget deficits why are we reauthorizing subsidies for large corporations i hope that my colleagues who criticize welfare for the poor on moral and constitutional grounds will vote against this program that provides welfare for the rich proponents of continued american support for exim claim that the bank creates jobs and promotes economic growth however this claim rests on a version of what the great economist henry hazlitt called the broken window fallacy when a hoodlum throws a rock through a store window it can be said he has contributed to the economy as the store owner will have to spend money having the window fixed the benefits to those who repaired the window are visible for all to see therefore it is easy to see the broken window as economically beneficial however the benefits of the broken window are revealed as an illusion when one takes into account what is not seen the businesses and workers who would have benefited had the store owner not spent money repairing a window but rather been free to spend his money as he chose similarly the beneficiaries of exim are visible to all what is not seen is the products that would have been built the businesses that would have been started and the jobs that would have been created had the funds used for exim been left in the hands of consumers leaving those funds in the private sector ensures that those resources will be put to the use most highly valued by individual consumers in contrast when the government diverts resources into the public sector via programs such as exim their use is determined by bureaucrats and politically powerful special interests resulting in a distorted market and a misallocation of resources by distorting the market and preventing resources from achieving their highest valued use exim actually costs americans jobs and reduces americas standard of living finally i would like to remind my colleagues that there is simply no constitutional justification for the expenditure of funds on programs such as exim in fact the framers of the constitution would be horrified to know that the federal government was taking hardearned money from the american people in order to benefit the politically powerful in conclusion exim distorts the market by allowing government bureaucrats to make economic decisions instead of individual consumers exim also violates basic principles of morality by forcing american taxpayers to subsidize the operations of wealthy companies that could easily afford to engage in international trade without government assistance exim also violates the limitations on congressional power to take the property of individual citizens
