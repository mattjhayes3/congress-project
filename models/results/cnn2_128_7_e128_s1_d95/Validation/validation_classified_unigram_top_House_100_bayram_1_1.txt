articles and the provisions of the abm agreement are complicated but what we are dealing with here is a fairly simply principle it is a new principle of thedemocratic party and it is called peacemeal enforcement of agreements i have laid out a lot of placards here in front of the audience not so that they will be on television i do not think that the cameras can see all of them the people in the chamber can see them the point is that the abm treaty is made up of many many provisions it has i believe 17 articles and 7 agreed statements it has got article 1 through 17 and it has got 7 agreed statements those together in total constitute the abm treaty the gentleman who is against my particular amendment that will be forthcoming has stated that there is no problem with the interpretation of the treaty and that the language that mr aspin put in the committee bill represents the treaty it does not represent the treaty the only thing that was put in the committee bill was one small piece of the treaty which is article 5 one of these placards of the 17 provisions it is oneseventeenth of the articles it happens to be the one that the soviet union relies on when they say we want a narrow interpretation of the abm treaty the point i want to make to you is very simple mr weldon is going to come up in a little while and he will have an amendment that will allow this house to finally express what it has wanted to say for years and that is that the soviet union has violated the abm treaty in substance he is going to come up and do that the point that i want to make is that this is not cutanddried this little small piece of the abm treaty that has been offered by mr spratt and by mr aspin is only a small piece of the treaty it is the piece that the russians rely on when they push for a narrow interpretation because if you read article 5 it says that the united states shall not develop test or deploy an abm system which is seabased airbased spacebased or mobile landbased on its face that sounds pretty clear on the other hand you get down to agreed statement d that was put in there for a reason and it says and i quote the parties agree that in the event abm systems based on other physical principles and including components capable of substituting for abm interceptor missiles launchers or radars are created in the future specific limitations on such systems and their components would be the subject of discussion now that puts a little ambiguity in this treaty is it a narrow treaty are they saying that you absolutely cannot build lasers or that you can or you are only restricted if you build missiles if you build radars this treaty was put together in 1972 the leading architect in my estimation aside from gerard smith the abm treaty one of our major negotiators that republicans and democrats alike rely on is paul nitze paul nitze says no we do not have a narrow interpretation of this treaty he said this is a broad interpretation because the soviet union in 1972 would not agree to a narrow interpretation of the treaty paul nitze the american ambassador says i tried to get them to agree to a narrow interpretation i asked them to do it they kept dodging me let me give you his direct quotes the soviets repeatedly opposed having the treaty cover devices other than these components he is referring to the traditional radars missiles et cetera in other words they did not want to have something limiting lasers they pointed outthis is the russiansthat it was impossible to know what the components of a system based on a technology not then employed would look like how they could be defined and how they should be regulated they said that if you havent built it how can you regulate it how can you ban it mr nitze concluded i remain convinced that though the unitedstates negotiators including me attempted to achieve a ban on the development and testing of spacebased and other mobile devices capable of substituting for abm components we failed to do so with the degree of certainty that is necessary for important international agreements all we achieved in a form the soviets would consider binding on themselves was a ban on deployment not on the creation of such systems and components in other words mr nitze is saying i went out and tried to get a narrow interpretation in 1972 and the soviet union evaded me they would not give us this interpretation in fact when we tried to put it right here in our article iv where it would have explicitly said any future systems are also banned the soviets demanded that that be deleted"], [0.011385434307157993, 0.011385434307157993, 0, "that is correct cardinal obando y bravo who is the main opposition to the communist sandinista government it is important to remember he was criticized strongly by somoza he said the mass for the sandinista government when they took over he was the one who negotiated commandante ortegas release from prison and here is an individual who was supportive as many in this body and many on our side of the aisle originally were supportive of the original revolution since that time it has become a communist dicatatorship now how does this fit in what point and the gentleman and the gentleman from connecticut and the gentleman from california have covered the other points it leads me to the major point that i want to make in 1938 there was a gentleman in this country named whittaker chambers who was a communist he was a member of the communist party here in the united states whittaker chambers became repelled by what he saw in the communist party the executions that took place in soviet russia and many other things he left the communist party in 1937 in 1948 he testified in many congressional hearings which resulted in the conviction of alger hiss who later went to prison in 1952 this is a man who was a communist whittaker chambers wrote a book the book is called witness now i would encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to read this book it is a very profound book and tells a story for today let me read the first page from whittaker chambers book witness he said in 1937 like lazarus lazarus from the bible who came back from the dead i began like lazarus the impossible return i began to break away from communism and to climb from deepwithin its underground where for 6 years i had been been buried back into the world of free men when we dead awaken i used to sometimes say in those days to my wife who though never a communist had shared my revolutionary hopes and was now to share my ordeals when we dead awaken for this title of an ibsen play i have never read somehow caught and summed up for me feelings that i could not find any other words to expressfears uncertalnities selfdoubts cowardices flinchings of the willnature to any man who undertakes to reverse in midcourse the journey of his life at the same time he said when he left communism i felt a surging release and a sense of freedom like a man who bursts at last gasp out of a drowning sea this elation was not caused and this is the frightening thing of the book this elation was not caused by any comparison of the world i was leaving and the world i was returning to whittaker chambers went on to say by any hardheaded estimate the world i was leaving that is the communist world looked like the world of life and of the future the world i was returning to that is freedom and democracy the world i was returning to seemed by contrast a graveyard it was in fact the same world i had abandoned as hopeless when i joined the communist party in 1925 only now its crisis which few men could diagnose 13 years before had reached the visible brink of catastrophe and still that stricken world did not know the nature of the catastrophe it still did not know or even want to know two facts that it must know to survive the meaning of communism and the meaning of the new breed of man the communist whittaker chambers went on to say i wanted my wife to realize clearly one longterm penalty for herself and for the children of the step i was taking i said you know we are leaving the winning world for the losing world i meant that in the revolutionary conflict of the 20th century i knowingly chose the side of probable defeat almost nothing that i have observed or that has happened to me since has made me think that i was wrong about that forecast but nothing has changed my determination to act as if i were wrongif only because in the last instance men must act on what they believe right not on what they believe probable since whittaker chambers wrote those words in 1952 19 countries have turned communist cambodia laos vietnam mozambique ethiopia angola cuba now nicaragua and i do not believe and i think we should do everything to see that it is the case i do not believe that whittaker chambers was right i think this body republicans and democrats and americans should do everything they can in their power to prove that when whittaker chambers says that when he was leaving communism he was leaving the winning side and joining the losing side as the father of five children who are going to have to live in this world long after i depart this troubles me deeply now to be opposed to contra aid and i would reprimand myself and the h 1174 co other members for using the word contra because contra means against it is a negative word i think a more appropriate word is to call the people in nicaragua who are called contras call them the democratic resistance or freedom fighters or something like that but to oppose aid to the freedom fighters in nicaragua is not a policy it is an abrogation it is just saying i dont know what to do but im not going to do anything now i happen to think that president arias of costa rica has come out with a very good plan a good idea i think this country the united states should support president arias in what he is trying but in order to support president arias and make these negotiations to be successful it is necessary to put pressure on the communist sandinista government in nicaragua because if we do not have pressure on that government they will never abide by negotiations and met with arias and duarte and the other members i just want to urge my colleagues here you may want to cut off aid later on in the semester or later on in the year perhaps but to do it now would basically doom president arias negotiations a vote to cut off aid to the freedom fighters or contras or democratic resistance would i think spell

these are are just nice kindly people down there who are not interested in communism they are interested in bringing in freedom to the people of nicaragua i think that these people forget history i would like to quote from some remarks that were made by our secretary of state george shultz before the american bar association that i think succinctly outline the threat of having a cuba in nicaragua we forget that cuba is on our shores and we forget what cuba is all about now we also forget about world war ii and early in the second world war german uboats destroyed unitedstates merchant shipping in the caribbean at a faster rate than we could replace it this is quoting secretary shultz but he more aptly outlines the threat that we now have in cuba and i quote one serious blow to this hemispheres security was struck in 1959 when fidel castro established a communist dictatorship in cuba and brought that island into the soviet camp he goes on today the soviet union cuba as an important military base in this hemisphere from cuba the soviet union flies reconnaissance flights up and down the east coast of the united states in cuba the soviet union has a port of call for its submarines from cuba the soviet union monitors united states communications using one of the largest and most effective electronic surveillance sites in the world cuban troops act as soviet surrogates in ethiopia and angola the cuban government smuggles arms and provides aid and training to guerrillas and terrorists throughout the western hemisphere in the event of a conventional war in europe or in the persian gulf cuba would constitute a threat to our ability to aid our allies and defend our strategic interests in those vital regions the secretary also said we risked nuclear confrontation with the soviet union over the removal of their missiles from cuba today we must spend billions of dollars to strengthen our counterintelligence apparatus and our naval and air defenses against soviet use of an island 90 miles off our shore and we learned the value of such an outpost to the soviet union which spends and i think this is important which spends over 4 billion every year

political warfare and helping communist dictatorships we had a vote on the house floor today in which the gentleman from pennsylvania offered an amendment which would have blocked travel to communist nicaragua and as amended by the gentleman from new hampshire it specifically blocked travel for those people who wanted to go to nicaragua to help the communist dictatorship militarily in other words under this amendment which passed by 213 to 201 it is not appropriate for americans to go to nicaragua to help the communist dictatorship militarily a number of my colleagues asked why this mattered and i want to take just a moment or two to talk about this amendment first of all i would recommend to every american looking at a book called the real secret war sandinistas political warfare and its effects on congress by francis bouchey michael waller and steve baldwin that book indicates clearly that there is a systematic soviet cuban and nicaraguan communist effort to influence the american congress to influence american politics and to frame the debate second i would say to my friends we are engaged in a long struggle with the soviet empire the soviet empire is the active enemy of freedom and the active enemy of america sometimes we engaged in that struggle openly as we were in the korean war and in vietnam sometimes we are engaged in that struggle covertly as we are to some extent in afghanistan probably the most open covert war in modem history sometimes it helps our side to have an american embassy in the country as it does in nicaragua and other times it is better to break diplomatic relations there is a systematic thorough soviet kgb cuban nicaraguan communist effort to establish soviet communist colonies in central america in the real secret war by bouchey et al they indicate clearly for example the degree to which the soviet union directs the cuban secret police in other documents which we have captured we know for example that cuban and nicaraguan diplomats in the united nations systematically try to manipulate american politics and the american news media all that we were saying in todays vote was that the united states should establish a policy that like lafayette whose picture is in this chamber we help freedom we help the forces of freedom we are opposed to communism we oppose the forces of communism in particular as a first step in this long march toward a free world we are not willing to allow wellmeaning but misguided americans on the left to go to a country to put on a uniform to carry a weapon that it should be against the law for americans to get a passport to go to help a communist dictatorship tragically two of the potential presidential candidates voted against that amendment two of them democrats who are running for president one announced one exploring decided to vote to allow americans to go to nicaragua to fight for a communist dictatorship on the side of communism i would suggest that is not an issue of freedom of speech it is not an issue of right of travel it is a fundamental question of whether should some day american troops go into nicaragua as they went into grenada as they might have gone into iran when our hostages were held what would happen then to that young american who foolishly had put on a nicaraguan uniform what would the relationship be then of those young wellmeaning americans who had been blinded into being procommunist who were standing there with a soviet ak47 and then what would this congress say whose side would this congress be on the young american in an american uniform doing what an american president asked him or the young american in a communist uniform carrying soviet weapons it is madness for us engaged in a longterm war with the soviet empire for us trying to preserve freedom across the planet for us trying to slowly and systematically help people be free it is madness for us to allow some of our children to be convinced they should carry soviet

provision there would be a prohibition of use of nuclear weapons in time of war that is a serious charge but it is totally fallacious here is what the amendment says the prohibition on appropriated fund use is effective 90 days after the date of enactment of this act and if the president certifies that the soviet union has carried out a nuclear explosion after the end of the 90day period he can proceed so it is an absurd argument that there is any prohibition on the use of nuclear weapons by us if there were an attack on us because this does not apply for the first 90 days and after that if there has been a nuclear explosion by the soviet union all the president has to do is certify it and then he is free of any restriction maybe it is the reductio ad absurdum by the other side that indicates the poverty of this argument i rise in support of the amendment the schroedergephardt amendment is necessary because this administration heedless of the consequences has turned its back on the bipartisan goal of a comprehensive nuclearweapons test ban this is the only administration that has not sought to build on the precedent of earlier test ban treaties this administration is

alike remains compelling the nucleararms race cannot be won and a test ban can help bring it to a halt dont let the reliable stockpile argument distract you its a red herring so is the argument that we cant arm our new missiles if we dont have new improved warheads the fact is that we do not need explosions of more than a kiloton to be sure our warheads can annihilate our adversaries these arguments are detours from the real issue do we want to have an ongoing nuclear arms race or not a ban on test explosions will not immediately and by itself stop the arms race too many alreadytested weapons are being developed and deployed arms control also requires urgently an agreement curbing the development and deployment of strategic weapons but a test ban on militarily significant weapons

part of americas defense structure the 97th bombardment wing at eaker air force base won the coveted omaha trophy which is annually awarded to the best unit in the strategic air command this honor

it may be extremely volatile in our various districts to address that question when it affects us directly all americans want to elirainate waste and duplication and unnecessary spending and so do we in congress as we approach these issues the gentleman from texas a minute ago mentioned that base closings alone do not solve the problem of expensive military preparedness the balancing of global commitments against the willingness of taxpayers to pay for the national defense is a vital issue after all if we close a base we still have the units involved which are 72 or 75 pecent of the cost and ostensibly they would be transfered to another facility somewhere else and that does not address the question of manpower levels and equipment costs and so on that are involved frankly i do not

i see what the full content of the bill is after the debate when congress or the adminis ration has an issue that it cannot resolve it seems that we resolve it by establishing a commission i do not think the secretary of defense really needs a commission and the only thing i can say as a member of congress who wants to fulfill my responsibility on these issues of national defense is that i am somewhat reassured that the process of allowing congress to approve or disapprove recommendations that may be made by the proposed commission still remains intact i appreciate the work that has been

represents a special concern to him because of his responsibility on that committee but nevertheless i think that we can look beyond the sort of internecine warfare that goes on in the management of our building and grounds here at the capitol through the committee on house administration which we are all grateful for the role they play i think we would look to see that the appropriations

body with regard to libraries with regard to a host of operations that are run through them whether it is the general accounting office whether it is their libraries whether it is a variety of other things and clearly in this instance i think as we look at this historic structure i think all of us have been dismayed at the fact that there has not been an overall view that it really does not have a continuity from leadership to leadership in terms of the preservation of this structure i think the people that built this building and designed the grounds really had in mind a rather good idea a grand concept in terms of this building as a symbol and fully intended that we maintain it i do not think the facade should have to fall off the front of the building before we respond and that of course has literally been the case in terms of congress in the past i think that there is merit to creating this type of commission and involving in a coordinated way and in a professional way people who have historic cultural and architectural expertise i know my colleagues on the various committees and in this con gress have a great deal of expertiae but i just think that maybe having some professional advice in a formalized process so we do not have to depend upon the personalities of one of the leadership or persons in special positions mr spealer i think this title viii provision has significant merit i think it is generally a good idea and i am sure that we would benefit greatly from more close scrutiny of how it has been written however i think that it is possible to cure any defects i think the good greatly outweighs the concerns in terms of the legislation provisions i do not think anyone would disagree with the intention i cannot argue that the process has been perfect we are at the end of the session and surely committee members from the committee on ways and means and the committee on appropriations have to understand when they bring matters back to the house that they need rules that are not necessarily within the normal ambit of the legislative process i would strongly urge the members to vote up this rule it is a fair rule it deals with a host of problems i understand the concern of my colleagues but i think we ought to vote this bill up it is a very good bill i think it will really go a long way to addressing some of the concerns and policies that this

it has come down in part because we made an agreement through legislation the whole herd buy out i do not know of many precedents for the federal government using federal funds to diminish competition so the people remaining in business would do better that was the whole herd buy out we used federal funds to buy up some of the dairy cattle so that the remaining people in the business would do better part of the deal was that there would be a set of continued reductions in the support price as part of that now the cows have all been bought out none of the ones that have been bought out are going to go back into production we talk about irreversibility the whole herd buy out was pretty irreversible the dairy farmers having had the benefit of that now are saying we should reverse it some

protect a few high priority military targets from the soviet first strike while i concur with the office of technology assessment report that it is unlikely that a system that meets the presidents original vision of sdi could be deployed in our lifetimes i nonetheless believe that the primary focus of sdi should be researching those advanced technologies which promise real defense from a responsive soviet nuclear threat the spratt amendment seeks to bring this about the spratt amendment continue to give sdio the flexibility it needs to manage the program this is not micromanagement

same level phase i received in fiscal 1988 the administrations rush to lock in sdi by making deployment in the mid1990s a major goal of the program has led the pentagon to request a 56percent increase in funding for phase 1 the phase 1 system if deployed according to the joint chiefs of staff wouldat mostknock out 30 percent of the incoming warheads in a fullscale soviet attack a recent report by the strategic defense systems division of lawrence livermore national laboratory was even more pessimistic of the effectiveness of the proposed phase 1 architecture the livermore report indicated that a spacebased interceptor system would be partially effective only against soviet missiles now in use and could quickly be defeated by fastburn boosters and other counlormeasures that the soviets could easily have in place by the time phase 1 became operational lho cost to the soviets would be miniscule in relation to ours the livermore report indicated that it would take e few thousand kinetic kill weapons in orbit to knock out a sizable fraction of the soviet ss18 19 icbms the study found that it would take 100 000 kinetic kill vehicles at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to destroy 90 percent of the current soviet threat clearly without the spralt amendment the nearterm sdi systems will continue to quickly absorb a larger and larger share of the overall sdi budget at the expense of

been designated as orphans under the lawand some 24 of these have been approved for market distribution it is important to note that the amendments considered today do not alter any of the key provisions in the law that have accounted for the industry research and development on orphan drugs instead the amendments are narrowly focused on reauthorizing the fdas authority to make grants for the development of orphal drugs the amendments will also help the fda improve its administration of the law and develop information on whether the incentives in the law should be extended to cover medical devices and medical foods the orphan drug programs greatest strength over the years is the widespread support that it enjoysfrom the congress the administration the patients and the pharmaceutical manufacturers however this consensus has been seriously tested over the past few months while possible changes to the current laws exclusive marketing incentives have been contemplated

can provide the balance needed for a child to grow into a healthy productive adult it is impossible to estimate the amount of good and the number of lives that have been changed by this program but if the success of a program can be measured by the demand for its services then big brothers and sisters of america can be considered a major triumph in los angeles county alone there are as many as 500 children waiting to be matched with a big brother or big sister i am certain that the demand would be even greater if more children knew of the benefits of the program on many occasions a big brother when visiting the home of a child is asked by the neighborhood children to become their big brother as well i wish that all children who want a big brother sister could receive their wish finally let me say that where this administration has consistently and knowingly ignored the needs of our children the big brothers and big sisters of america have stepped in and filled a part of the void i thank them for their dedication and pledge my continued support"], [0.0028426051139831543, 0.49715739488601685, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i r 5430 is a compromise bill that has been

0.5029881596565247, 1, "i rise in strong support of h r 2939 and in strong opposition to this amendment it bears repeating that the fundamental purpose of the independent counsel law is to prevent the institutional conflict of interest that exists when executive branch officialsthe attorney general and the department of justiceare the parties charged with investigating criminal allegations against themselves or others in the same branch of government generally there is no such conflict of interest when executive branch officials investigate those in a separate branch of government such as members of congress in the legislative branch the attorney general and the department of justice are properly charged under current law with conducting criminal investigations of members of congress executive branch officials have not shirked that duty and they have been successful in prosecuting members of congress of both parties for the rare cases when such a conflict of interest does exist current lawwhich h r 2939 continueddoes already provide for the appointment of an independent counsel to handle the investigation of the member of congress i believe this is exactly the balance that needs to be struck and i commend the committee on the judiciary in achieving this result if the amendment before us were adopted however the balance drawn in the current law and continued in h r 2939 would shift in very harmful ways indeed we constantly are working to eliminate problems of political abuse this amendment merely creates another such problem if adopted members of congress will be more easily targeted for completely unfounded criminal investigations that really are designed to affect general elections we do not have to create this new potential for political abuse we can retain the sensible proven effective system for conducting criminal investigations of executive branch officials and of members of congress that is already in place we can do this by rejecting this amendment and i strongly urge my colleagues to do so"]]}
