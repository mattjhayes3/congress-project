decision to significantly help 7 5 million americans who this congress has virtually ignored we can make this choice only by allowing an upordown vote on congressman millers bipartisan bill this bill

proposed budget passes it would be a disaster for constituents in my home district on long island and districts nationwide forcing working families to make up for many of the cuts in the form of higher state and local taxes the american people deserve honesty and this budget is dishonest by omission and dishonest in how it portrays the overall budget projections the president claims that the steep budget cuts he advocates are necessary to cut the deficit in half in 5 years this is simply not true and the budget the president proposes fails to accomplish his stated goal first the budget is dishonest by omission nowhere in the fy06 budget does the president account for significant costs including fails to account for the enormous costs of privatizing social security as proposed by the president a whopping 6 trillion over the next 20 years 754 billion over the period from 20092015 fails to account for the continuing presence of our troops in iraqthe administration knows we are going to approve an iraq supplemental upward of 80 billion for the first part of this year aloneand an estimated 384 billion over 10 yearsyet still omits it in the budget fails to account for growth in interest costs fails to reform the alternative minimum tax that is disproportionately burdening middle income families in my district on long island as troubling as the glaring budget omissions is the knowledge that the deficit is largely a selfinflicted wound the president inherited a record annual surplus of 236 billionwhich now 4 years later has tanked into a deficit in excess of 400 billion any attempt at honest accounting suggests that we are looking at a decade or more of similar deficits the reason we are faced with an unethical budget is because the president refuses to acknowledge the fiscal irresponsibility of his choices and will not entertain even the most moderate suggestions such as repealing only the portion of the tax cuts that benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers unfortunately this budget builds on a disturbing trend this administration and the leadership in congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage the tax policies the president advocates disproportionately advantage the wealthiest to the detriment of working americans and working families will continue to bear the brunt of the rising inflation spurred by the rising interest rates the bill gates of the world pocketed their tax cut at the insistence of the president however this president sees no problem eliminating funding for perkins loans in his budget even though the cost of tuition is rising and will continue to rise as the administrations policies force inflation as a result of the decision to eliminate perkins this year more than 670 000 student borrowers could lose out on loan forgiveness if they become teachers law enforcement officers or if they serve in the military this is just one of many examples of valuing wealth over work in my district the budget scales back and eliminates several longterm shore protection projects important to the safety and economic security of long island the president has no problem zeroing out the fire island to montauk point study just as it nears completion the president eliminates funding to dredge the patchogue river even though this creates a huge safety hazard for boaters the president does not hesitate to slash funding for the long island sound study office from 7 million to less than 500 000 even though this is vital to the livelihoods and economy of the east end of long island the president falls far short of his promise under the no child left behind bill even though this means that taxpayers will have to foot the bill at the local level to pay for education finally the president does not seem to mind taxing veterans health care at 250 per year and doubling copayments for veterans prescription drugs at a time when we should be saluting our

as members of the blue dog coalition it is what we call the debt tax debt and that is one tax that cannot go away until this republican congress and this administration gets our nations fiscal house in order last week the president made a big announcement about how the deficit really was not as bad as what his white house had first thought and reported it would be i think the best way to sum up the events of last week can be found in an editorial july 11 2006 from the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished and i will not read the entire editorial but i think it sets the stage for what we plan the spend the next hour discussing this evening it starts off like this the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldressed presidential dogandpony show but president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign the editorial from the los angeles times dated july 11 2006 continues this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 and it concludes that part of the editorial by saying that is not much to crow about well they are right last week the administration released its midsession review of the budget and after further examination lets take a closer look at what the report actually tells us the report actually tells us that what we have here is another record deficit the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit makes 2006 one of the four largest deficits in our nations history it is hard now to believe that we had a balanced budget in this country from 1998 to 2001 but it did not take this administration and this republicanled congress very long to turn fiscal responsibility into record deficits i 2000 as you can see the largest deficit ever in our nations history occurred in 2004 when the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was 413 billion in red ink in hot checks if you will the year 2003 was the second largest deficit ever in our nations history where for the first time in over 50 years the republicans controlled the white house the house and senate and they gave us the second largest deficit ever in our nations history 378 billion the third largest record deficit ever in our nations history again occurred while the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was in 2005 and it was 318 billion deficit the third largest deficit ever in our nations history then this year the president has a press conference has a grand ceremony and event to announce that the deficit for fiscal year 2006 is only 296 billion the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history i think the editorial in the los angeles times had it right when it said that is not much to crow about the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit as i indicated makes 2006 the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history while this number represents an improvement over the 2005 deficit of 318 billion it still ranks as the fourthlargest deficit ever in our nations history these revised estimates do not account for the extent of our budget problems because they include in the calculation the annual surpluses in social security the first bill i filed as a member of congress when i got here in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund this republican congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund this outofcontrol deficit this outofcontrol debt this reckless spending that we are seeing occurring in our nations capital and the way the republican leadership is running our government and thiscountry in fact when the social security surplus is excluded as it should be the 2006 deficit is not 296 billion it is 473 billion now throughout the evening we are going to be talking more about this

bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked

us ducks responsibility for this reckless plan we know that privatizing social security would require borrowing 2 trillion over the next 10 years debt borrowed against our children and our grandchildren not surprisingly this inconvenient reality is left out of the conference report the budget is our federal governments statement of priorities crafting it involves tough choices among

not fair clearly your chart shows a differential between the wealthiest folks in this country and the folks that are on their way up to hopefully becoming the wealthiest in this country certainly they have got that opportunity with hard work and applying themselves to that so i would just like to point out that maybe we need a different system maybe sometime next year let us have this conversation about a different way to collect the minimum amount of money needed to fund this federal government and we will have that conversation i would like to comment though on health care and individual responsibility i think it is universally recognized and that is a hard thing to state with a straight face but i think it is universally recognized that americans enjoy the finest health care delivery system in the world you yourself have been an integral part of that as an orthopedic surgeon and your wife i believe is an anesthesiologist members of the delivery system that this country enjoys we have got a flawed payment system and i am not sure how we got to this point and place but we are here we have got a system that if you ran your car insurance program the same way we run health insurance then each time you needed to change the oil in your car or new tires you would file an insurance claim that is not how we work our cars we figure out a way to operate our automobiles out of our normal monthly budget we budget for that and take care of those incidentals we do have car insurance for the catastrophes for wrecks for destruction and theft those kinds of things those catastrophic deals our health care system is flawed in that quite frankly i get the services you provide me the services and someone else pays for those services in that scheme i am not as concerned about the cost of those services as i ought to be because i am not writing a check to help out with that so i have no incentives so to speak to ask you are there alternatives to what you have proposed is there another way to do this or cheaper way can we do it at some other hospital that can be a little less expensive than the one you typically practice at because i am writing those checks getting personal responsibility back into the health care system getting a system in which i have a viable interest in asking that question we may ask that question on every other single thing that we do how much is that going to cost we may not ask it out loud but we make a costbenefit analysis each time in our head each time we make a purchase on something such as how do i want to pay for that we do not do that in medicine and it needs to be communicated to all of us that that is okay to do in medicine there are some things in medicine you do not ask emergency or catastrophic kinds of things you go get that thing there is an awful lot of medicine that i think is subject to a circumstance where we can ask what that costs and i think just doing that would begin to drive down those costs as the

will clear up i have got a prescription drug card so it was going to cost me 15 or whatever i said 900 he said yeah i said well what happens if i do not do that he said in about 3 months it will clear up i made a costbenefit analysis and decided that i would forgo the antibiotic treatment and go with the professional judgment it was my decision i need to stand behind that decision and if 3 months later my condition had gottenworse and i had other problems that may have been fixed if i had taken a different tack i cannot go back on the doctor or should not and sue the doctor or the pharmacy or whatever sue anybody that is still breathing because of a decision that i made personal responsibility is not only taking responsibility for paying for health care but also reclaiming your health care decisions because those are yours you are responsible for that and you yourself know there will be the occasional bad outcome to any procedure to any field and that is just nature doctors are not perfect or hospitals none of us are those legitimate just bad outcomes is just the system and we ought to take personal responsibility for that i had several doctor clients and to a person if they did something wrong if they created an issue or made something that aggravated something with a patient they were going to fix it period no matter what it was but in many instances they used their absolute best professional judgment to treat a patient and they just got a bad outcome that is life so this personal responsibility issue that i am talking about is decisions for what health care you do get or you do not get and the costs i think the health savings accounts that we have instituted in certain instances will help us do that so that putting away money in a health savings account if you have a normal monthly kind of an expense come up i have to decide do i take that money out of my health savings account that is growing or do i figure out a way to do it out of this months budget or my normal operating budget so bringing that personal discipline back to the table in the arena of health care is not the absolute overall magic bullet but it is a piece of the fix that is health care costs i appreciate this opportunity to share this hour with the gentleman and i look forward to hearing the remainder of the gentlemans comments from a learned colleague in an arena that is obviously of vital importance to all of americans"], [0.9996345043182373, 0.9996345043182373, 0, "i want to take these few short moments and bring a little more positive perspective a brighter outlook and hopefully a little more unifying message than we have just heard and frankly than we often hear in the united states house chamber especially by some of my good friends from the other side of the aisle we call this the official truth squad i thank the leadership and the conference for allowing me to come and share a few words tonight the official truth squad grew out of a frustration on the part of the freshmen class of the republican conference we all were elected in 2004 24 strong now 26 of us here in the united states house of representatives after a relatively few number of months we grew frustrated with the fact that there was a lot of misinformation and a lot of distortion and a lot of frankly deception that was going on here and so what we wanted to do was to put together a group of folks that would come to the house floor and try as best we could to provide some truth some facts to the situations that we address here in the united states house of representatives we have just gotten back from a week at home a district work period over the memorial day week i heard from constituent after constituent about two big issues one was illegal immigration obviously the largest issue we have to deal with as a nation right now but the second one in meeting after meeting after meeting with constituent after constituent all across my district on the north side of atlanta was people asking why on earth is congress so divided why is it so partisan why do you have the kind of sniping that goes on and i am loathe to answer that question because it is so difficult to understand why there are many in this chamber who are not interested in working positively or productively together it just boggles my mind these are not democrat problems or republican problems these are american problems and american problems deserve a united congress working together so what you have just heard in the last 15 minutes is an individual who will tell you that quote this is a republican congress problem well we do better if we work together the fact is that it is extremely difficult to get anything moving forward positively in congress without the support of many different folks and so we work better when we work together what you hear so often is what i call the politics of division the politics of division is so destructive they do a disservice to every single one of us in this nation i tried to put some words to the consequences of the politics of division and i think i have found a quote i have shared it with you before and it comes from the reverend william boetcker who was a philosopher and leader around the time of the late 19th century and early 20th century he described what he said was a social philosophy and he attributed it to abraham lincoln nobody can actually determine whether president lincoln actually said these words but reverend boetcker talked about them and i think they crystallize and capture my concern my suspicion about what the consequences are of this politics of division that is so destructive he said you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cant help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer you cannot encourage the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred and you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich now that kind of crystallizes i think what is a unifying american philosophy it is a philosophy that would serve us extremely well here in the united states house of representatives how often do you hear people just castigate out individuals who are more wealthy than others destroying the rich in an effort to build up the poor it doesnt work that way it doesnt work that way our system never has our system never has done that and so the official truth squad tries to bring some credibility and truth to these discussions we have adopted a motto which is a qubte from a wonderful united states senator daniel patrick moynihan from the state of new york and this quote i think makes it so that everybody has to be held accountable and what senator moynihan said is that everyone is entitled to their opinion and they are and opinions are here in the countless number everyones entitled to their opinion but theyre not entitled to their own facts everyones entitled to their opinion but they are not entitled to their own facts which is why it is so frankly troubling that the blue dog group gets up here night after night week after week and talks about how they want to be fiscally responsible you know we used to say that folks who were politicians that said one thing at home and did something different in washington werent being responsive to their constituents well the blue dogs have perfected the art of saying one thing in washington and doing another thing in washington and we will use some facts here are some facts you want to talk about facts during the fiscal year 2006 budget this was the plan of the blue dogs and the democrats instead of being responsible about spending they offered programs that would have spent 21 5 more billion dollars you didnt hear that from folks on the other side of the aisle that is the truth that is the truth how many in new taxes 54 billion in new taxes talk to me now about what the truth is and what is being proposed and what is being said in washington and what is being voted on in washington and what is being said back home how many mandatory savings the republican conference all on their own in a very difficult way because we got no cooperation from folks who will tell you one thing at home in fact they will tell you one thing that same thing in washington but they will do exactly the opposite we gained 40 billion this savings with the deficit reduction act earlier this year how much mandatory savings on the part of the other side zero zero that is the truth that is a fact that is not opinion that is a fact the bills that they brought forward the blue dogs my good colleague just before me talked about wanting a balanced budget we have given them an opportunity to vote on a balanced budget in fact we did so just 3 or 4 weeks ago here on the floor of the house of representatives not a single one of those 37 blue dogs voted in favor of that balanced budget not one they talk about making certain that you pay as you go that you only pay for programs that you have the money for we have offered that on the floor of the house we do not get the support of the blue dogs they talk about having a rainy day fund doesnt it make wonderful sense to have a rainy day fund because we know year after year after year we will have emergencies like katrina or other emergencies there is an average of 20 billion annually where there are emergencies that need federal money during the course of any given year on average 20 billion so what does the republican congress propose that we are being accused of doing in fact what we do propose is a rainy day fund in the budget that we just adopted for fiscal year 2007 how many members of the blue dog how many of those 37 blue dogs voted in favor of that rainy day fund not one not one same number that we got when we talk about the mandatory savings zero not one of them support it i want to talk about a little positive information about this economy because you wont you may not hear about it on the nightly news you may not read about it in your newspapers you certainly wont hear about it from some folks who want to make certain that they practice this politics of division and this politics of deception did you see the new job figures last month the month of may 75 000 new jobs created and this economy over the past 12 months has created 1 9 million new jobs 1 9 million new jobs more than 5 3 million new jobs since august of 2003 the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 6 percent lower than the average of the 60s 70s 80s and 90s a picture oftentimes says it so much better than any of us can so let me see if i can show you the picture of that kind of job growth that we have seen over the past 3 years here it is on a graph here we are in january 2002 with unemployment up at about 5 7 to 8 percent here is the job growth at that time and then on the bottom we have the number of months going by we havent even gotten to this month but earlier this year what has happened to the unemployment rate it has gone down whats happened to the job growth it has gone up significantly again 5 3 million new jobs since august of 2003 so the curious individual the individual who wanted to solve problems and work positively and productively on behalf of the american people would say well what happened when this seemed to change when unemployment h3420 co rates began to go down when the job growth began to go up what happened what occurred there well lo and behold you know what happened we had tax decreases appropriate tax decreases responsible tax decreases by making certain that americans got to keep more of their own money and when you allow americans to keep more of their own money what happens they spend it and they save it in wise ways and then the economy flourishes so because of the tax policies of this congress of this congress and this administration we have seen increasing job growth and decreasing unemployment what else about the economy is going on revised reports show the fastest real gross domestic product growth in over 22 years in the first quarter real gdp growth grew at an annual rate of 5 3 percent in the first quarter productivity increased at an annual rate of 3 7 percent in the first quarter hourly compensation real hourly compensation rose at a 3 2 annual percentage rate in the first quarter personal income increased at an annual rate of 6 7 percent in april since january of 2001 real after tax income has risen by 12 9 percent why mr speaker because of tax policies appropriate responsible tax policies put in place by this congress this administration this leadership and oftentimes in spite of what you hear at home and in spite of what you hear by my friends on the other side of the aisle oftentimes more often than not frankly without a single individual helping on that side of the aisle in fact they come down and they say these tax decreases the tax reductions will destroy the economy will throw people out on the streets but you know what happens what happens is that unemployment goes down job growth goes up and in fact sometimes they will even say that at 1 minute and then they will vote for the same thing that they just said was awful just said was awful just a moment before that truth is so doggone important in the public discourse remember you can have your own opinions but you are not welcome to your own facts you have got to talk about facts and that is why the official truth squad takes the opportunity as often as possible to come down here and talk about facts talk about facts with the american people because the politics of division again does a disservice to every single american we live in a glorious nation a wonderful nation a nation that is still seen by men and women around the world as a beacon of liberty and a repository of hope i am proud to serve in the united states house of representatives and to have the opportunity to share a positive productive

supreme court requirement for medical emergencies for abortion does that not mean anything to anybody here similarly a nurse at a clinic just providing directions to a minor or her driver could be

have 820 000 constituents in delaware and probably more than a third of them have some kind of a disease that might be able to be benefited by embryonic stem cell research that is true of the figures in the country we have 110 million people who have illnesses out of the 290 million people who are living here they have visited my office they have visited your offices there is not a person in this room who has not had many many visits by people who have very very serious needs whose lives are going to be shortened i am all for the first bill we debated today because i think it might help somewhat but i have also looked at some statistics and i have come to realize that of the 15 leading diseases adult stem cells cannot do anything about 14 of them and can do a only little bit about heart diseases as they deal with only blood diseases in terms of what they can do embryonic stem cell research has the ability perhaps to do much more than that people are going to get up and they are going to say well it hasnt done anything yet they were only discovered about 62 years ago if you read the vast body of research in the united states of america on this subject by people who are truly knowledgeable you are going to learn there is more potential here than anything that has ever happened in medicine in the history of the united states of america congress should never ever turn its back on this opportunity how are we going to get there how are we going to do embryonic stem cell research i do not have time to go through the whole in vitro fertilization process except to say that we create embryos in that particular process they are then frozen they are generally used and well used the 400 000 embryos which are out there to help give birth to people who might not otherwise be able to have a child but at the end of the process a decision is made by the individuals that may be involved with that if the decision is they no longer want that particular embryo they may do a variety of things with it they may as has been discussed here give it up for adoption they may decide to have it discarded as hospital waste that is where the vast almost all of them actually go as hospital waste we want to give them the opportunity to say within that embryo there are stem cells which could help other people live better lives and give them the opportunity to be able instead of having it put in a bag for hospital waste sitting at that table to be put over here and the state to be able to do the research that is what we need to do we need to be able to develop that as rapidly as we possibly can for the benefit of all mankind i rise today im support of h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act i have been in public office for over 30 years and throughout my career ijust like all of youhave had the opportunity to change and improve public policy so this country may continue to flourish on the principles it was founded and the 820 000 people i represent in the state of delaware are a constant reminder to me of this responsibility i am their voice in the congress of the united states some of you may be wondering why i have become so interested and involved in embryonic stem cell research and frankly the answer is simplethose 800 000 constituents we estimated that aboutonehalf of all visits to my office are about health care and about onehalf of those visits are by delawareans who are suffering themselves or whose family members are sufferingfrom juvenile diabetes alzheimers cancer parkinsons hiv and hosts of other dredge diseases year by year the groups would grow in number and soon we would have to get bigger rooms for our meetings in the early years we would discuss the necessity of funding the national institutes of health and i was proud to be able to support newt gingrich and the republican partys drive to double funding for the nih and that funding has gone toward the basic science needed to find cures and treatments to our most debilitating diseases but in the past few years the number one topic on these groups minds was embryonic stem cell research one little girl stands out in mind i met her a few months ago at an event back in delaware olivia was two months old when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes her parents were first time parents so it is no wonder that the practice of testing her blood sugar and giving her insulin shots was extremely heartbreaking olivia is now 6 and has never known life without diabetes she is the person we are fighting for on the floor today she is one of 110 million people who are suffering that may be helped by stem cell research i remember very clearly the difficult decision president bush made on august 9 2001 and i know how careful he was to balance the needs of science with his own moral concerns at the time the compromiseto allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells lines that had already been derivedseemed quite reasonable but as we know unfortunately the number of lines eligible for research once as high as 78is now only at 22 with the nih saying the number of lines will never get above 23 so when diana degette and i began discussing how to expand the presidents policy in an ethical manner i went right back to the speech he gave to the nation in 2001 we wanted to be as consistent as possible with the ethics he laid out in his speech as we worked to update the policy the legislation we are going to vote on today h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act which has the backing of the medical groups the scientists the research universities and the patient advocacy groups mirrors the presidents ethical requirements i will read them to you and ask that you think about them very closely 1 embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need 2 the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom the embryos were created have determined that the embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will otherwise be discarded and 3 the individuals for whom the embryos were created have provided written consent for embryo donation and without receiving financial inducement you may ask what is differentwe simply lift the arbitrary august 9 2001 date it is also critical that we are clear about what this legislation does not do 1 no federal funding for the destruction of embryos or human life this is prohibited by law 2 no federal funding for the creation of embryos for research under our legislation it is up to the couple to decide what should happen to their embryos embryos can be adopted or donated embryos can be frozen for future family building embryos can be discarded after that initial decision is made and if a couple decides to discard the embryos our legislation would allow those couples to make a second choice do they want to donate them to research an embryo or blastocyst is about 250 cells and the inner cell mass is about 100 cells and that is where the stem cells come from they are created in a petri dish are about 5 days old and are the size of a pine head of the 400 000 frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics throughout the unitedstates about 2 percent are discarded annuallythat is about 8 00011 000 embryos that could be slated for research allowing the option of donating these excess embryos to research is similar to donating organs for organ transplantation in order to save or improve the quality of another persons life the bottom line is when a couple has decided to discard their excess embryos they are either going to be discarded as medical waste or they can be donated for research throughout this debate you will hear about adult stem cells and more about umbilical cord cells and how these types of cells are sufficient for scientists this is simply not true umbilical cord cells are adult stem cells and they are limited adult and umbilical cord cells are already differentiated into the types of cells they are they are difficult to harvest and grow and they do not exist for every tissue type on the other hand embryonic stem cells are master cells they have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the body they are easier to identify isolate purify and grow and they are capable of cpntinual reproduction listen to what the nih has to say on this topic human embryonic stem cells are thought to have much greater developmental potential than adult stem cells this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotentthat is able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotentrestricted to specific subpopulations of cell types as adult stem cells are thought to be in 2003 1 6 million people died of heart disease cancer diabetes alzheimers kidney disease liver disease and parkinsons of the 15 leading causes of death adult stem cell research only addresses one adult stem cells have been around since the 1960s embryonic stem cells were only isolated in 1998 we must explore research on all types of stem cells but the reality is the only policy that is restricted is the federal embryonic stem cell policy the nih is the right place to oversee this research because it can regulate the ethics it provides for scientific collaboration and peer review and promotes publication so all breakthroughs are reported and all scientists have access to the latest research discoveries without nih oversight there are no guidelines as to how this research should be conducted the united states has always been the premier leader in biomedical research in our country and around the world as science continues to move rapidly forward we need to continue to lead the way but we are not why should we waste one more year one more day forcing millions to suffer because of a policy that is outdated and unworkable does this congress really want to look back 10 years from now and say that we were the ones holding the treatments up or do we want to be the congress that says we back science we want research to flourish and we played a small role in making that happen support h r 810 the

the resolution h r 748 the child interstate abortion notification act makes it illegal to transport a minor across state lines for the purposes of getting an abortion now transport is not defined in the bill when the judiciary committee marked up the bill i offered an amendment which said simply that we should exempt taxicab drivers and others in the business of professional transport from the transportation provisions of the bill because as written it would be a federal crime for a taxicab driver to take a young woman who gets in a cab and says take me to the abortion clinic so i can get an abortion if the taxicab driver complied with that task he would be committing a federal crime now even if he were not prosecuted there is a civil liability provision in the bill which exposes the cab driver and through the principles of agency the entire cab company to civil liability by the parents of the young woman who find out how she got to the clinic so let me read my amendment the prohibitions of this section shall not apply with respect to conduct of taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport however the report in the markup filed by the majority described the amendment thusly mr scott offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution if they are taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport now i will let the public decide whether or not that is a distortion i believe that it is but i would just say that if a prosecutor has evidence that a person is a sexual predator the last thing they would do would be to go to this provision of the code which is a misdemeanor rather than the various felonies that they could prosecute the person for the amendment does not immunize a sexual predator from the crimes of being a sexual predator just the provisions of this transportation provision which is just a misdemeanor now let me just say in any event whatever you think of the bill this distortion obviously speaks to character btt in my view the descriptions in the committee report and the distortion of those amendments particularly the one i just described say more about the character of the person responsible for describing the amendment that way and the character of those trying to defend the distortion than it does about my amendment i would therefore

"i rise today in support of the office of national drug control policy reauthorization act and i was pleased that the house judiciary committee adopted two amendments that i offered and that they are part of the base bill street drug markets such as open air drug dealing at the corner and at drug houses are a serious public safety problem often located in poor minority and disadvantaged communities they cause severe harm by easing initiation into drug use supporting addiction and by drawing youth into the drug trade my first amendment which is designated sec 14 of h r 2829 provided for demonstration programs by local partnerships to shut down illicit drug market hotspots by deterring drug dealers or altering the dynamic of drug sales this provision authorizes funding for demonstration programs that seek to coordinate an effective intervention using a credible deterrent message this would encourage criminal justice agencies to collaborate with researchers and social welfare agencies to analyze local conditions and develop strategic problemsolving interventions such an approach was proven successful in high point nc upon identifying the drug market and its small group of active dealers law enforcement carefully monitored and documented drug activity and probation parole violations through surveillance and drug buys offenders with any violent criminal history were immediately arrested nonviolent offenders on the other hand were confronted by law enforcement city officials service organizations and their families with a strong deterrent message they were given a choice between facing immediate legal action or ceasing dealing and receiving rehabilitative services consequently the drug market promptly collapsed with minimal police intervention or crime displacement within one year of implementation the drug crime rate of high point fell by 34 and the violent crime rate was cut in half sec 14 of this bill authorizes 10 million for the next three years to fund demonstration programs supporting these interagency collaborations the agencies would be responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the strategic intervention and the director would be responsible for submitting to congress a report identifying the best practices in drug market eradication my second amendment which is designated sec 15 of h r 2829 provided for demonstration programs by local partnerships to coerce abstinence in chronic harddrug users under community supervision through the use of drug testing and sanctions this provision authorizes funding for demonstration programs that seek to reduce the use of illicit drugs by chronic harddrug users living in the community while under the supervision of the criminal justice system approximately 80 percent of the nations cocaine is consumed by a relatively small group of chronic users approximately 4 million threequarters of these users are under the supervision of the criminal justice system by deterring these users we would be able to reduce the nations cocaine consumption by 60 percentand these numbers are similar for other hard drugs such as heroin and meth coerced abstinence is a highly effective means for targeting these users this model is based on predictable frequent drug testing and known nonnegotiable immediate graduated sanctions for example a system where a participant is tested every 72 hours and a dirty test led to an immediate unpleasant sanctionfor example 8 hours in a jury box or 24 hours in jail participants are simultaneously offered incentives such as drug treatment or other rehabilitative services an ongoing example of this model is being used in hawaii where substance abuse violations are common with meth being the drug of choice in october 2005 one year after the program began program participants had an 83 percent reduction in positive test results from 21 9 for control group to 3 8 for program participants and an 87 percent reduction in missed appointments for testing from 10 for control group to 1 3 for program participants this level of effectiveness we cannot ignore for this reason sec 15 of h r 2829 authorizes 10 million for the next 3 years for demonstration programs that administer drug tests to individuals at least twice a week and swiftly impose a known set of graduated sanctions for noncompliance the program must include a plan for monitoring the progress toward reducing the percentage of positive drugs and missed testing appointments and the director would be responsible for submitting to congress a report identifying the best practices in reducing the use of illicit drugs by chronic harddrug users i commend the office of national drug control policy for publicly committing itself to the goal of reducing illegal drug use and abuse in the united states however i also call on the director to increase the allocation of funds dedicated for treatment and demand reduction efforts which have shown to be very successful in reducing drug use to achieve this national drug control policy that efficiently reduces drug use and abuse in the united states we need strategies that are as smart as they are tough this requires

of course we know that some have been concerned a civil war may be breaking out over there but the truth is what this boils down to is they have been finding with the ieds these explosive devices that have been killing now both iraqis and americans that that hasnt worked they have seen we have a president with firm resolve that we are going to stay the course and make sure the country is ready to stand on its own and then let her stand so they realized they were not being successful in that regard so a lastditch effort you have terrorists from other areas coming in and blowing up their own precious mosques to try to turn shia against sunni it is obvious that this is a lastditch effort to try to divide the country because it scares a lot of folks over there greatly to think about a democracy succeeding right in the heart of the middle east i mean that could spread to iran boy that scares iran it could spread to syria there are a number of countries over there that it scares them because democracy as the president has said could change things and those folks are right on each others borders if i could take you back to 1973 between my sophomore and junior year in college i was an exchange student in the former soviet union back then we didnt call it the former soviet union it was the soviet union and i spent asummer there and associated with and dealt with college students there in ukraine where i was and i developed a number of friends one of whom was an engineering student a smart guy he spoke a little better english than i did russian well a lot better english than i did russian we had some wonderful conversations very frank veryhonest discussions and at one point he was saying you americans seem to not understand why we would cling to communism but it is the best thing we have ever had we have had two major wars on our own soil and we have had to divert most everything to defense just to protect ourselves as he pointed out you on the other hand you have got two major oceans protecting the east and the west think about that that is profound and that is something that will be written about the united states hundreds of years from now when someone writes about the rise and fall of the greatest nation in the history of the world that we had two major oceans now i would say that is a blessing from god that is what has allowed this nation to be nourished and to grow without much threat of intervention from other countries because they had to cross two major oceans to get here the thing that concerns me is finding out we are potentially allowing footholds on our own soil we are giving up an advantage i didnt realize we had other foreign countries managing leasing utilizing avenues of entry in our ports but now we have one transaction that is up right now with the uae the united arab emirates as some have pointed out the uae has been our friend since 9 11 and that is interesting in and of itself but there is a transaction in question that has stirred up much of america for them to purchase or lease terminals at six of our ports so i think it bears looking into if this goes through of course they would be handling shipping arrivals departures unloading at the dock and other security sensitive functions yes we would still have our coast guard yes we would still have american customs at work some of us are aware that they do not always catch everything we are a little sarcastic sometimes in texas but they may have containers sitting on their docks for a number of days they will necessarily be aware of the manner in which our government inspects containers how it selects the maybe 5 to 6 percent that it actually xrays how it goes about selecting which container will be one of themaybe 1 percent that they actually examine the current administration has looked at the issue and seems surprised that americans are really upset about the issue and i want to say about this president he is the first president in at least 30 years to take seriously the threat of a foreign government i know i was in the united states army at fort benning georgia back when the united states soil was attacked and americans were taken hostage that is an act of war under international law you attack somebodys embassy as ours was attacked in iran it is an act of war and it justifies defending yourself and we did nothing we begged them to let them go and then later because of a lack of leadership here in washington there was a failed rescue attempt that embarrassed us even further but it sent a message that perhaps we do not have the stomach we cannot handle these things perhaps if we had had an administration in washington 30 years ago that took care of business when we were attacked we would not be worrying about these issues now but it did not and so we do some say well since the uae is one of three nations to have recognized the taliban as an official government that that gives them concern as it should there are indications that the uae also saw an opportunity for making money and so apparently there were al qaeda moneys that flowed through uae systems but this administration has done more to fight terrorism abroad than any perhaps in history this terrorism is a relatively new phenomenon for our young country but we have not done so well at home and so it bears looking at even more closely we need legal immigration we need people legally coming across the border willing to work most all of us were a result of immigrants even being here it is a good thing if you are willing to work but we need to secure our borders so terrorists do not come in now since there is a war going on near our unitedstates border at our unitedstates border and some of us believe there have been insufficient efforts by the federal government to intervene and help our sheriffs and those that are trying to fight that war it gets even more critical i personally do not believe that this great nation should be
