amendment rights of americans and at the same time to take our nation into the 21st century with responsible gun ownership that leaves little room for the illegal gun activity that we see taking place in terms of gun trafficking in terms of the use of deadly arms in the hands of those who are unlicensed to hold them as it relates to background checks the proposals focus on new background check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of the national instant criminal background check system the nics and the greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the state level specifically it directs the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to obtain a federal license to do so and to conduct background

background checks for the purchasers who purchase certain dangerous firearms and other items through a trust a corporation or other legal entity it encourages greater communication between federal and

harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of god and the inhumanity of

congress unanimously in 1998 and signed into law by president clinton the act condemns violations of religious freedom and promotes and assists other governments in the promotion of the fundamental right to freedom of religion while strides have been made in establishing worldwide practice of freedom of religion it is currently under attack let me also note that people are being prosecuted under blasphemy laws for freedom of expression which is why i introduced the bipartisan measure h res 290 calling for the global repeal of blasphemy laws i support h r 1150 because we must continue to work to preserve religious freedoms as well as making sure that religion is not a pretext for prosecution or persecution in the world indeed one of the key amendments to irfa would be to relocate the office of international religious freedom within the office of the secretary of state this action would allow for greater coordination of strategic focus and the minimization of duplicated efforts streamline mandates and centralize efforts to engage religious communities and promote human rights more generally in regards to religious freedom currently the office is headed by the ambassador atlarge for international religious freedom which monitors religious persecution and discrimination worldwide to develop policy recommendations programs and awareness besides being placed in the secretary of states office the ambassador at large would be able to make every effort to collaborate and coordinate across all unitedstates agencies and departments to formulate strategic religious freedom policies programs and activities these two changes will provide a greater ability for us to advance religious freedom throughout the world h r 1150 will also allow us to assist emerging democracies to implement freedom of religion while also helping older partners maintain their freedom of religion practices and conscience h r 1150 calls to ensure that our diplomats and foreign policy experts are well versed in the importance of religious freedom and how to address atrocities related to religion h r 1150 also addresses how to improve our ability to promote freedom of religion by enhancing the capabilities and knowledge of our diplomats our foreign service officers fso are on the front lines everyday carrying out american foreign policy while also shaping it which makes sure that they are adequately trained on religious freedom h r 1150 directs the secretary to develop mandatory religious freedom training for all foreign service officers this major change will enhance fso capabilities to identify severe persecutors to help assemble the ambassadors annual report on international religious freedom in addition to the annual report h r 1150 calls for an updated lists of persons that are currently being persecuted and forced to renounce their faith this is essential in bringing awareness to countries that need to be monitored or that have nonstate actors that have high levels of detainment disappearance torture or murder based on someones religion another key aspect of h r 1150 is to enhance engagement and coordination with the executive branch on issues pertaining to international religious freedom policies and global religion engagement strategies this would be achieved through amendment of the national security act of 1947 calling for the appointment of a special adviser for global religious engagement and establishing the interagency policy committee on religious freedom and engagement i urge all members to support adequate funding in

carolinas controversial antilgbt bill explained the article says several civil rights groups and lgbtq advocates are organizing a rally tonight in raleigh this is from march 24 of this year north carolina to protest the states controversial passage of its house bill 2 which critics have called the most antilgbt bill in the country the article says heres everything you need to know about the bill also known as the public facilities privacy and security act which was signed into law by governor pat mccrory on wednesday what does it do house bill 2 declares that state law overrides all local ordinances concerning wages employment and public accommodations thus the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own rules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual orientation and gender identity though north carolina does have a statewide nondiscrimination law it does not include specific protections for lgbtq people we keep adding letters you know we kept adding letters until we got to lgbt and now we have added q the law also directs all public schools government agencies and public college campuses to require that multipleoccupancy bathrooms and changing facilities such as locker rooms be designated for use only by people based on their biological sex stated on their birth certificate transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get the biological sex on their birth certificate changed under the law public institutions can still offer single occupancy facilities and nobody has a problem with that if you have got a single bathroom facility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom that is fine it can be for whoever needs to use it but they are saying as has been consistent with the history of the world for most of the worlds existence that if you according to documentation are a female you use the female restroom when it is for multiple peoples use at the same time and if by documentation you are a male you use the male facilities it has really been shocking to see how many people including singers and entertainers and different groupsi understand target now wants to make sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please but it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we have to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there if a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom according to the big popular movement now for heavens sake lets let the man go in the little girls bathroom north carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the world since the world began if you are going to have a multipleuse restroom normally you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom a male go to a male multiuse restroom this article goes on it says republican lawmakers who make up the majority of north carolinas general assembly publicly unveiled the language of the bill wednesday morning it goes on and talks about its passage in less than 12 hours i am talking about after its passage the bill was approved by the house and senate or after it was brought forward the bill was passed signed by the governor lawmakers in the house voted 8325 to pass the bill the senate approved the bill 32 0 after democrats who make up the minority walked out of the chamber in protest obviously they want men to go to little girls restrooms too republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from radical action by charlotte critics of charlottes ordinance said it could have allowed men who may be sexual offenders to enter a womans restroom or locker room by claiming a transgender identity well critics of the charlotte ordinance is what the article says but actually that is not just a claim that is a fact under what north carolina was objecting to if someone who is a sexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little girls restroom where he has no business people like the entertainer that doesnt want to go to north carolina they are saying by golly you have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom what has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part of this country i mean there was a very intelligent man on fox news bill oreilly who actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show so they passed this law they dont want men going into the womens restroom basically was the crux of it or boys going in where little girls go he asked the question actually who are they trying to protect i couldnt believe that we have come to the point where an intelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question whether you agree or disagree with what north carolina did whom they were trying to protect it is almost rhetorical clearly whether you agree or disagree they were trying to protect the little girls 1245 it is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question gee whom are they trying to protect by saying men cant go into girls restrooms incredible the outrage aimed at north carolina has just been incredible i see an article today by ryan lovelace from the washington examiner trump slams north carolina bathroom law says state should leave it the way it is the way apparently charlotte was going to have it was that men could go in little girls restrooms of course sexual predators who are male all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get to go in the little girls restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them a sexual predator whom are they trying to protect in north carolina they are trying to protect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves they count on adults to keep them from harm it is incredible that people are outraged at north carolina anyone who has children who are female do you really want men to say i am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going to the bathroom where you cant go because you are not transgender you are the girls father this article says what do proponents of the bill argue it says republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from radical action by charlotte john rustin president of the north carolina family policy council testified before the senate saying that the charlotte ordinance means men could enter women restrooms and locker roomsplacing the privacy safety and dignity of women and the elderly at great risk parenthetically i noticed an article in recent days last week that indicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender restrooms has had a problemand it has come up a couple of timeswhere men would come in where women were showering go into the restroom and use their cell phone hold it up over the stall so they can film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some privacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom what is wrong with saying do you know what when it comes to going to the restroom females will go to female males will go to male and look if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to use or families to use to change diapers or whatever those are really handy those are very helpful my wife and i have used them ourselves raising girls it is a handy thing to have but why condemn north carolina when they are just trying to protect the privacy of girls it has already been shown that if you give guys a chance to say i am transgender and i can get to go in and film a girl in a shower there will be people that do that why not let the transgender lgbtqrstwhatever the initials arelet them have their activities where they dont impose upon the privacy of someone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from the opposite sex being there with them governor mccrory wrote this statement the basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings a restroom or locker room for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of charlotte as a result i have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect april i i mentioned that i understand target may now be changing their restrooms i will have to doublecheck because if they are going to be having women come to mens restrooms i wont be going to target to shop unless and until that changes usually target is great they have the restroom right there where you go in the door to the store normally you dont have to go clear to the back of the store it is a handy thing if you have to go shopping it is handy but not anymore anybody that wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex may need to shop elsewhere we will have to look at what they have actually done anyway this article seems to make the point that it is not such a crazy thing that north carolina has done and that is why for 99 999 percent of human history since civilization exists since we got past the caveman era when there have been public restrooms you recognize there is a difference between males and females some day it will be written in the rise and fall of the united states that the greatest freest and most powerful country in the history of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the pinnacle of its greatness and successand this will be one of the symptoms that was written aboutthat they thought they were so much smarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a difference was recognized between men and women for purposes of facilities it is a sad day for the country now i see this article from yesterday that curt schilling an espn analyst was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media post here is what schilling said the post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and womens clothing with parts of the tshirt cut out to expose his chest it says let him into the restroom with your daughter or else you are a narrowminded judgmental unloving racist bigot who needs to die apparently this kind of thing offends espn although at one time their job was covering sports now their job is being social managers apparently in making sure that if men want to go to little girls restrooms then we let the men go to little girls restrooms this article from yesterday talking about target stores says target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify how about that et tu target so here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name of political correctness rules the day common sense is no longer common and to the point that the current leader in the republican campaign for president even says that north carolina should not have taken action that in essence says menwhich would include sexual predatorsshould not be allowed to go in womens restrooms he wanted it left like it was so if charlotte wants to say that if you are a man and you are a sexual predator and you say you are transgender and want to go into the restroom where little girls are go ahead that is the position of the leading republican candidate i dont know hopefully that will be another one of the positions he will change but in the meantime we need to get common sense back in charge in america while we are still the great country we have been i yield back the balance of my time"],

entirely reasonable period of time under the nlrbs radical new policy union elections could be held in as little as 11 days after a petition is filed as an employer myself of not a large business i dont know if i could find a labor attorney in 11 days to go through this very complicated legal issue this is not nearly enough time for employers to present their side to employees or for those employees to make an informed decision unfortunately for workers the nlrb rule doesnt stop here of grave concern to me is the threat posed to workers privacy currently employers are required to turn over a list of employees and their home addresses to union organizers within 7 days after an election is ordered so you have a week the ambush election rule instead would open the door for greater harassment and intimidation by requiring employers to turn over each employees name address phone number email addressall within 2 days of an election order it is for this reason that i introduced the employee privacy protection act in the last congress this bill would have required only the names of the employees and one piece of contact information of the employees choosing the employee gets to
