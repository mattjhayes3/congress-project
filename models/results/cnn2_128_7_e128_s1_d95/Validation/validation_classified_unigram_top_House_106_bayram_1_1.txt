security by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us

would punish people for earning and working hard a system that would be obstructive of capital formation we could not have done a better job our tax system is the largest impediment to people moving from the first rung of the economic ladder to the second because the harder you work the more you save the more you invest the more we take it is a system that is inefficient we have seen testimony from the kemp commission to harvard studies that says for a small business man or woman to comply with the code and to collect and remit 1 in business income taxes it costs them anywhere from 4 to 7 the current code is not understandable our own irs tells us that if you call the irs for help in filling out your own tax return 25 percent of the answers they give you will be given in error over 50 percent of americans have to pay others to decipher the tax code and do their taxes for them in an effort to show how complex the irs code has become money magazine created a fictional american family and asked tax professionals to prepare an irs tax return incredibly every one of the tax professionals came up with a different tax total and not one of the tax professionals calculated what the

are willing to tell our children i want them out of our lives these are not bad people they are people doing the job that this congress by statute has directed them to do but we should not have any

the relatively simple tax return that you would get if we move toward a flat tax under our system we would have no tax return at all and you would never have to keep a receipt or a record not one let

spent a summer in serbia when i was in college i lived with a family and i care about these people and look forward to them moving to the postmilosevic nightmare period into hope for the future this act supports the democratic opposition by authorizing 50 million for promoting democracy and civil society in serbia and 55 million for assisting the government of montenegro it also authorizes increased broadcasting to yugoslavia by the voice of america and by radio free europe and radio liberty the acts strength is that it follows the strong and effective policy crafted by the administration and the demonstrated will of the serbian people themselves as evidenced by yesterdays vote the legislation codifies the socalled outer wall of sanctions against yugoslavia by multilateral organizations including international financial institutions it also authorizes other measures against yugoslavia including blocking yugoslavias assets in the united states prohibiting the issuance of visas and admission to the united states and prohibiting strategic exports to yugoslavia loans and investment and militarytomilitary cooperation it is important to note that yesterdays encouraging election results from serbia do not negate the need for this legislation milosevic may not relinquish control making support for democratic forces nongovernmental organizations and free media even more vital even if a peaceful transition were to somehow occur as one recently took place in neighboring croatia a new government and independent media would desperately need international support in a nation that has known authoritarianism and corruption for far too long and so i urge my colleagues to support h r i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9772582687437534,

supporter of this resolution which commemorates the 10year anniversary of one of the most astounding historical events of the 20th century the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of communism throughout central europe what started out as a trickle solidaritys victories in poland during june of 1989 hungary opening up its border with austria later that summer led to a deluge of east germans flooding across the berlin wall and a few weeks after that the velvet revolution in czechoslovakia took place and no one could predict these events and no one knew how to react to these events one of my most cherished possessions that i still keep here in washington with me on my desk is this chunk of the berlin wall it still has graffiti painted on it coincidentally it is shaped like the state of wisconsin but it is a chunk that i personally whacked out of the berlin wall on october 3 1990 during the reunification celebration when i was over there as a student traveling throughout central europe this came at a crucial time in my life as a third year law student i was watching these historical events unfold with rapt attention like the rest of the world was but i was feeling a little bit disillusioned and a little bit cynical about our own political process here in this country so i decided a few months after the revolution had taken place to travel through central europe to visit the european capitals live out of a backpack survive on cheese and bread during that time and see firsthand these remarkable changes taking place i met when i was traveling through there the real heroes in my mind of the revolutions and the changes that took place they were students such as myself about my age who had literally on the front lines of the demonstrations literally looking down the barrel of communist guns and facing soviet tanks not knowing whether they were going to succeed or whether this was going to turn into a massacre they knew their countries individual histories 1968 prague spring 1956 hungary when the communist authorities did in fact crack down and as history later showed during the velvet revolution the politburo voted 5 to 4 not to use force to bring down the demonstrations one vote could have made all the difference in prague during that fall of i asked many of these students what they remembered most about those demonstrations and the events and they said two things how terribly cold it was as they were maintaining candlelight vigils all night long and the fear that they felt again not knowing whether or not the military was going to open fire on them but perhaps the most important wall that fell in that region to make this all possible was not even visible it was the wall of fear that fell and we cannot overestimate the role that fear does play in any totalitarian or authoritarian regime to keep them in power but this was made possible because mikhail gorbachev as the gentleman from california already indicated changed the dynamics in the region by denouncing the use of force in order to keep communist governments in power by pursuing his policies of glasnost and perestroika the general opening of information and ideas in these regions it diminished the fear and empowered people to have the courage to demand change perhaps it is the greatest magnificent irony that one of the most oppressive communist regimes in that area czechoslovakia would later be led by former poets and playwrights vaclav havel the first democratically elected president in czechoslovakia was a former playwright himself the first democratically elected president since masaryk and edvard benes just before the second world war he was the founder of charter 77 the moral blueprint for change in the area and also founded the civic forum that gave the people in czechoslovakia the political alternative to the communist regime but not before he was imprisoned on four separate occasions in fact during one of those imprisonments he was on his deathbed literally the communist authorities did not want a martyr on their hands so they went to him and said listen the people who give out the obie award will allow you to direct your own play in new york and get proper medical attention and he said i just have one question if i go will you allow me back in and they could not give that assurance and so he refused the rest as we say is now history but in conclusion i just want to pay a special tribute and wish a special happy 10year anniversary to those students who really were on the front lines and showed through their courage that there are causes and ideals greater than ones self that are worth risking everything for so on this day my thoughts and my memories go to many of those students who i personally had a chance to meet and who inspired me to get involved in public service when i did return to the united states"], [0.9717688821256161, 0.028231117874383926, 1, "i thank the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman

situation we are going to do our best to manage in kosovo we have got an incredibly healthy economy but we cannot be certain what lies ahead the most prudent thing for us to be doing right now is to make paying down this massive federal debt our highest priority there are three good reasons why we ought to do that first is it is the right thing to do for our children and grandchildren we should not force them to inherit this massive debt the second reason is it will help us prepare medicare and social security for the retirement of the baby boomers because those funds that we set aside by virtue of paying down the debt can be used as the baby boomers begin to retire and put more strain on medicare and social security finally it is the best thing we can do here in congress to assure that this economy will stay healthy chairman of the federal reserve board alan greenspan testifying before the house committee on the budget makes it perfectly clear that as wepay down this federal debt and the federal government competes less to borrow money in the private sector it has a direct bearing on interest rates in my home like many of the homes we represent hillsborough county and tampa and florida where the average mortgage is about 115 000 when we drop interest rates about 2 points from 8 percent to 6 percent that reduces a monthly mortgage payment by 155 i will tell my colleagues that 155 reduction in that homeowners monthly mortgage payment is better than most of the tax cuts that are being promised here in washington they can be taken immediately and one does not have to call ones accountant to figure out how to do it that is just one example of the positive impact of paying down the debt apart from the fact it is the right thing to do apart from the fact that it is the best thing we can do right now for medicare and social security so i urge my colleagues to take a second look at this 780 billion tax cut that we just passed here and let us go back and let us do a tax cut but let us put first things first let us pay down this massive federal debt let us make that our highest priority it will produce benefits at home for homeowners for students who have

america is great for many reasons we have a larger population base than say germany we have massive natural resources but the key to america being the worlds only superpower is not in the numbers of our people or in the size of our cornfields but in the creativity of the american people our creativity der rives from the way our predecessors framed the role of government they recognize government

more each year under this bill now i know some of my colleagues may say that the price increases brought about by this bill may be small but small increases in price can make a big difference to a working family struggling to get by or to a struggling mother trying to make ends meet or to programs such as wic food stamps and the school lunch programs which are impacted tremendously by the price

unanswered by business over the past decade crop insurance for farmers has shown not only that private insurance sometimes fails to provide a guaranteed safety net in necessary situations but also that it can become enormously costly even though the republicans prescription drug bill is tallied at 40 billion today i have no doubt that just like crop insurance its costs would multiply many many time as we have to come back to provide higher and higher subsidies over the coming years and still seniors would be left without the guarantee of prescription drug coverage seniors deserve certainty about getting help with their prescription drugs they deserve to be treated equally regardless of whether they live in rural communities like my district or big cities like dallas they deserve to have
