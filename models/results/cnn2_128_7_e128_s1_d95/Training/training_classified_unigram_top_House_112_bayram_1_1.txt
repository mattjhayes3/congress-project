that was established by congress in 1988 with passage and enactment of the commercial space launch act amendments the structure of the liability regime is modeled on the priceanderson act that governs risksharing for the nuclear power industry there are several features of the commercial space launch act amendments but one that is central to todays debate is indemnifying commercial launch and reentry operators against catastrophic losses suffered by the uninvolved public or third parties since 1988 the office of commercial space transportation has licensed more than 200 commercial space launches and three reentries without any claims for federal coverage for loss of life serious injury or significant property claims the 1988 act was driven in part by the emergence of foreign launch services companies that were made competitive through government subsidies and preferential foreign national laws including indemnification foreign launch companies continue to be formidable competitors if this program were allowed to lapse it would threaten our domestic market for launches as the cost of insurance would significantly increase the office of commercial space transportation as part of its licensing and permitting mission administers financial responsibility and risksharing requirements for commercial launch and reentry operators they calculate the required amount of financial responsibility based on the maximum probable loss of the license applicants proposed launch or reentry in the event there is a catastrophic accident the operators insurance coverage would be first in line the governments liability would then cover excess claims above the insured amounts but not to exceed 2 7 billion and i also want to note that to trigger federal indemnification the administration must submit a request to congress for claims in excess of insurance coverage and congress must in turn pass a separate appropriation bill to fund the request responsibility for any claims above the federal cap would revert to the launch or reentry operator the space and aeronautics subcommittee held two hearings this congress examining the activities of the office of commercial space transportation and the performance of its licensing and indemnification regime administration and industry witnesses provided compelling evidence that indemnification for thirdparty claims is needed to preserve the unitedstates commercial launch market i want to reiterate that the federal governments exposure is only for thirdparty claims and only for amounts that exceed the maximum probable loss determined by the office of commercial space transportation our commercial space launch industry needs this extension while there are only a small number of commercial launches occurring

thinking that republicans want to do something negative to those programs it is amazing the misinformation thats out there about republicans and our attitude toward medicare and social security in fact its republicans who have a plan to save medicare and social security and thats what i tell seniors but theyve heard that the congressional budget office has projected that medicare part a would be bankrupt in 10 years and they know theyve paid into these programs and theyre relying on them to provide critical medical care for them when they need it in the past congresses have taken a pass on reforming these programs to keep them solvent for both todays seniors as well as for future generations who are currently paying into them like we are but the house republican path to prosperity

impact medicare benefits for anyone 55 or older but it will improve the program so that those 54 and younger will have access to the same kind of health care program enjoyed by federal employees and members of congress were often criticized for having a separate program but this will allow the seniors to participate in the same kind of program that we participate in its far better than letting the program wither on the vine which is what those who refuse to take action would allow to happen and again as my colleague pointed out its our friends on the other side of the aisle who voted to cut

relief has been reactive bureaucratic arbitrary and billions of dollars are spent sometimes that happens with little or no accountability resources go unused goals are not met and redtape delays recovery in the end it seems washington focuses sometimes solely on the price tag rather than on the people we are trying to help the current model assumes that politicians and bureaucrats in washington are best suited to decide where when and how best to allocate resources during an emergency but common sense and decades of experience tell us otherwise it is the people on the groundlocal officials and emergency responders of course but also individuals families and voluntary organizationswho are best equipped to help communities respond and recover from disasters as i looked into these issues it became clear to me that even as the federal government has distributed billions for recovery with the right hand regulations and bureaucracy have choked the recovery process with the left hand our recovery policy needs to be both more flexible and more consistent flood victims on the east coast deal with the same issues as flood victims in the gulf yet they are often faced with different rules and requirements federal policy should be clarified so that local officials and private citizens understand the process before a disaster occurs rather than having to deal with it and figure it out after the fact my amendment would create permanent substantive regulatory reforms to assist victims of all disasters it would create no new federal program or taxpayer burden it would instead remove redtape and provide temporary but immediate regulatory relief for disaster victims and relief volunteers it would make it easier for a family to access savings to begin immediate recovery it would temporarily waive certain regulatory burdens for people providing essential services after a disaster it would expedite shipping to ensure we can get critical materials to areas affected by a disaster most importantly my amendment would make these reforms automatic so that communities could begin rebuilding immediately and without having to wait for washington dc to act these

serve through this term i wanted to do so in hopes that we would win the majority with a goal of pursuing the fourpoint platform that i had always run on that being the pursuit of a free economy limited government a strong national defense and personal freedom i wanted to work with not just my republican colleagues but my democratic colleagues as well working in a bipartisan way to accomplish a number of things first it was absolutely essential that we do everything to end the course that we had been on that ultimately brought us an 82 percent increase in nondefense discretionary spending im happy to say that weve turned the corner on that second after years of languishing we were finally able to pass three trade agreements that will create good jobs for union and nonunion workers in this country by virtue of having passed the panama colombia and south korea free trade agreements i also believe that its very important for us to recognize as we look at our national security the notion of people all over the world who are seeking to determine their own futures has created a wonderful opportunity for us the house democracy partnership another strong bipartisan organization has just now partnered with its 17th country in central asia to help the legislative body strengthen and have the kind of independence and oversight of their executive branch that we have a tendency to take for granted here fourth i feel very stronglyagain working in a bipartisan waythat it was essential to ensure that both democrats and republicans have the opportunity to have their ideas heard through their amendments on the floor of the house of representatives now i do believe again that this is the greatest deliberative body known to man weve got a great deal of work that lies ahead

that somehow this will de facto cause the problem to be implemented or not avoided basically i guess it says again what is being proposed by the epa is an agency that was not designed to address climate change with plans that not only were not designed and using a vehicle that was not designed regarding this problem but by the own admission of the administrator does not even know and cant give us even a slight percentage of what reduction we would have so i just have to say to my dear colleague from illinois that i appreciate his concern but his concern should not be us telling epa not

lets look at that a little bit closer so if the presidents will were to prevail on this in other words if this tax hike goes into place then the top tax rate for some small businesses would be over 44 percent now contrast that to the top tax rate that president obama is proposing which would be 28 percent all afternoon you are going to hear a lot of things go back and forth but you wont hear anyone contradict those numbers and that disparity because they are true there is no sense in telling corporations you get a 28 percent rate and the top rate for small business is 44 percent theres nothing fair about that all right well lets look at another argument another argument is that this somehow closes a budget gap and this is deficit reduction and were all about deficit reduction and lets have at it well a little secret on the deficit reduction is at best the most generous estimate is this would take care ofwhat maybe 7 8 9 10 days of spending maybe but who would pay the cost for that ill
