airport improvement program will be cut off last year we attempted to pass a comprehensive longterm bill that would have extended alp and faa funding however due to a breakdown in conference negotiations only a shortterm 6month extension for the alp was passed as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in february of this year the house passed h r 99 a sixmonth bill to extend alp and fund faas operations and facilities and equipment programs through the end of fy 99 h r 99 was passed so that alp funding would not run out while we attempted to pass our longterm aviation reauthorization bill air21 h r 99 was passed out of the house and sent to the senate on february 3 two months prior to the expiration of alp funding on march 31st in the shadow of this imminent deadline last week the senate passed a twomonth extension bill that would fund alp only through may 31st of this year the senate bill also includes technical changes for the military airport program and the small airport fund within alp to allow them to work under the limited extension in addition the senate bill extends the war risk insurance program for two additional months its funding is also set to expire on march 31st this is an important issue especially in light of current events the house passed h r 98 in february which extended the war risk insurance program through 2004 if the senate should pass h r 98 it is our intention that that bill extension for 5 years should take precedence over this twomonth provision finally the senate bill allows the faa to consider a pfc application from metropolitan washington airport authority up to a limit of 30 million under current law faa is not allowed to consider a pfc application from mwaa although this bill only extends the programs for two months instead of the housepassed six month bill it is important that this bill pass so that funding for alp does not lapse i urge you all to support this bill so that this short term measure is in place and

the conference report on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill this legislation rushes aid to people in need all over the world and here at home it also provides badly needed funds to modernize and improve our military readiness and to support nato so that we can bring the conflict in kosovo to a speedy and successful conclusion and while i routinely oppose legislative riders on appropriations bills i also support the legislative language included in this bill to address the treatment of the state tobacco settlement funds under medicaid this language identical to the bill introduced by the chairman of the health and environment subcommittee mr bilirakis amends the medicaid statute to clarify that the states will be permitted to keep the tobacco settlement funds for the benefit of their own citizens he deserves a great deal of credit for his hard work on this issue all of us have heard from our governors our state legislators and attorneys general about how important this language is to our states and our constituents they told us about their plans to reduce smoking among the youth and to improve access to healthcare for children they have argued that they were the ones who took the risk to recover these funds and the federal government should leave the states alone these are all excellent arguments but the most important argument for why we must act now is the reality of the situation some states like florida settled their suits against the tobacco companies before the states entered into the master settlement agreement and have already received their first payments from the tobacco companies the other states expect their first installments by the year 2002 the states are trying to make budget decisions while the administration has reversed course and is indicating that it will seek reimbursement for its share of the medicaid costs the states disagree with the administrations assessment and have drawn a line in the sand without legislation we face many years of protracted litigation between the states and the federal government the first issue that would have to be resolved in any litigation would be whether the federal government has any claim to this money at all while the administration believes that this is an open and shut case the states do not agree and would likely take this to the supreme court and even assuming that the administration would prevail the next question would be even more complicateddetermining what portion of the settlement award represents reimbursement for medicaid expenses in their lawsuits the states brought many different causes of action including state antitrust and consumer protection law violations courts would have to determine what portion of each states settlement funds represent medicaid expenses and to what portion of the settlement the federal government is entitled this question is even more complicated when considering states like virginia which never brought a suit but participate in the settlement or the numerous other states which did bring suits but had their medicaid claims tossed out of court the end result is that the fundswhich everyone agrees should be used in large part to reduce youth smoking and improve public healthwill sit in bank accounts doing nothing well into the next century that is a result that none of us wants i have every confidence that other states if they are allowed to proceed with their plans will follow the lead of my own state of virginia virginia has already pledged most of these funds to reduce smoking among teens and young adults to improve access to healthcare for children and to assist tobacco farmers and workers in their transition to other industries many states have similar programs planned or underway while others are waiting for congress to resolve the question of who can lay claim to the money if members believe that we need to do more to discourage youth smoking they need to vote for this bill and support this language they need to resist efforts to earmark a percentage of these funds to their favorite project they need to trust the states to do the right thing i urge my colleagues to support this bill to support this language and to oppose efforts to strip out this language"], [2.1476760593941435e-05, 2.1476760593941435e-05, 0, "i would now like to shift gears and talk about the federal public lands the largest landowner in the united states is the federal government and by far by far the largest owners of land are the federal government the state government the city government the local districts et cetera et cetera et cetera we depend very heavily on the use of public lands i thought i would begin tonight by showing some examples of some beautiful public lands now i am a little biased in this regard my state the state i represent is the state of colorado and i have been very fortunate to represent the 3rd district of the state of colorado many people have been to aspen many have heard of glenwood springs or steamboat or telluride or durango breckenridge summit county grand junction there are a number of different communities that some people have visited they know about the colorado rockies the colorado rockies are a gem they are a diamond for the united states we need to do what we can do to preserve those while at the same time while at the same time allowing people to live out there we are going to cover a little of that let me first of all point out this is in the district i will use my red pointer here we will see the red pointer on the sky above the mountains this is the maroon bells one of the most beautiful settings and i am sure many of my colleagues have been there this is fall obviously which can be seen by the colors many many thousands and thousands of visitors whether handicapped whether 19 years old and have great big legs everybody gets to have access that can get here can go up there and see this beautiful beautiful gem of our country the maroon bells i know the maroon bells i was born about 40 miles away my brother climbed the maroon bells when he was 14 years old right there on that peak where the red dot is unfortunately during that climb a rock came off the top he was in outward bound school and it killed his instructor he was 14 or 15 years old we have a lot of family history and there are a lot of people in this country that have a lot of history in these mountain ranges i am from the mountains so are many of us but the mountains are something we believe in we have a strong heritage with the mountains we want to protect the mountains now that is what this looks like today see my red beeper my little light there the lake that is how it looks today why does it look like that today is it because we allowed oil well drilling to go up on top of it no is it because we put mines in there no is it because we clear cut all the sides no is it because we let them fish out the lake no is it because we let them pollute the water no what is my point my point is that for 200 years and before that with the native americans we have taken care of this land washington d c would like to convince us that this thing is full of oil rigs that the timber that the small families that make a living off timber go up there and clear cut this land that the fishermen fish out the streams that the streams are polluted and that the only way to do this is move the west wing of the white house to now have that command center for the western united states they think it matches west wing western united states so they come up with a program 40 million acres now what does 40 million acres mean many people if they own a home they are on a lot size maybe they have i do not know half an acre a half an acre where their home is located imagine 80 million times that half an acre that they own and that is what the president today has proposed to in essence take off limits what i am saying here is these are assets these are museum pieces these mountains are beautiful we know this we want to protect them but we have to use common sense and in using common sense we cannot just do it for the elite people of this country we have to consider the common man of this country and i say that generically we have to speak for the common person in this country do not forget about them not everybody can have a farm or a ranch in aspen colorado not everybody can own a home in aspen colorado i certainly could not afford it and most of my colleagues on this floor could not afford it but that should not keep us from being able to go up and enjoy it it should not keep us from being able to go up and recreate on it like skiing i can say within eyesight of maroon bells one can see several of the major ski areas in the world have they polluted the maroon bells no have they caused clear cutting in the maroon bells no do they provide jobs for colorado yes thousands of jobs do a lot of people get to enjoy the recreation of skiing in aspen colorado yes lots we have to be careful about allowing an administration who by the way rarely sets foot in colorado and last year when they locked off a big chunk of the state of utah they announced it the president announced it in the state of arizona come put your hands in the soil come put your hands in the dirt mr president come see what you are doing before you do it know a little something about it before you talk about it i know about it i was raised there my family has been there for generations let me show my next display here these are the fourteeners look at this all over colorado i will point out there is the young compadre peak this one is the mount of the holy cross right here where my finger is i will put the red pointer so it can be tracked by the red pointer columbine park look at all of these we have over 54 of them over 14 000 feet in colorado form these beautiful mountain ranges do my colleagues see any clearcutting that has gone on no do my colleagues see any oil rigs no do my colleagues see tents and cities and condominiums and town homes all over those 14 000 foot peaks no why do my colleagues not see them it is because we protect this land but we protect it with common sense we do not lock everybody out of there one can ski on some of those mountains one can cross country ski in the summer guess what we have discovered something it is a wonderful sport it is a fabulous sport mountain biking one gets to mountain bike a lot of this does it tear up those mountains no are people who use those mountains responsible for the most part yes for the ones who are not let us go after them if this is an asset if they are going to abuse it kick them off but do not kick them off in general just because they are human beings do not put all of the four systems of the united states into a museum the federal lands i will show my colleagues a couple other here real quick this right here this is a winter scene here in colorado take a close look at that look at that snow do my colleagues see bulldozer tracks through that snow no my colleagues do not even see snow machine tracks through that snow why because we have designated trails we manage those lands out there those lands are not just important to the united states they are important to those of us who make a living off of those lands my inlaws for example david and sue ann smith my colleagues ought to visit them they live in meeker colorado you want to talk about salt of the earth people you want to talk about environmentalists do my colleagues know why they are environmentalists they have got their hand in the soil every day ask him what he thinks about that ranch ask him what he thinks about that ranch when people come up and offer him millions of dollars for that property they do not want to sell it they love that land the smith family is pretty representative of most of the ranching families i mean the president is about to go out and destroy the way of the west the territory remember the judge from the supreme court go west young man go west maybe it was greeley horace greeley said that go west young man go west do not wipe it out do not make it an urban area do not restrict it for the presidents museum at the white house work with us and help us protect this in a common sense approach a common sense approach this is colorado these are more peaks that i want my colleagues to see beautiful absolutely beautiful those are protected president clinton does not need to skip in and protect them any more than they are protected right now we are preserving them we know how to take care of this land what i am saying to my colleagues in my district alone and i say my district the peoples district that i am lucky enough and fortunate enough to represent in that district alone we have over 23 million acres of governmentowned land 23 million acres we take darn good care of that land we have a lot of uses of that land recreational land recreation wilderness areas we do have some timber we have very little mining left anymore we have a lot of different uses for that land president theodore roosevelt i want to quote him because the president in the last couple of days wants to put out an image that he is the theodore roosevelt the teddy roosevelt who rode in on the bucking bronco to save the west let me tell my colleagues what teddy roosevelt said i think it is very important here because he talks to the common man president teddy roosevelt was known as a common man he understood the ways of the east he understood the ways of the west i think before somebody lifts themselves to that standard they ought to at least qualify for it let us talk about teddy roosevelt conservation conservation means development as much as it does protection i recognize the right and the duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but i do not recognize the right to waste them or to rob by wasteful use the generations that come after us that is the approach the balanced approach in essence what he is saying is there is a right for people to use these lands but there is no right no right by the people that use these lands to destroy these lands for future generations we have got really two extremes one end of the spectrum over here one end of the spectrum over here this end of the spectrum says hey we ought to be able to go out there and mine it and clearcut it and develop it all we want over here on this extreme we have got organizations like earth first lock them out put everything in wilderness take away the right of multiple use i will talk about multiple use here in a minute take away those rights but do my colleagues know what most people in america and certainly most of the people that live here feel that in the middle ground there we can do both we can allow some ski areas we can allow cross country skiers we can allow mountain bikers we can raft on those wonderful beautiful rivers in colorado we can hike yeah we can allow a power line to go across them to some of our communities that are circled by federal lands there are things we can do with federal lands we are going to restrict it we are going to be balanced on the other hand they also say there are places the same group that says one can ski and ride on mountain bikes and raft down the rivers that same group the middle group as i call it the real westerners as i call it also believe hey there are some areas like the maroon bells that we just saw like this area right here to my left just like this area where my hands are there are some areas we need to lock those away let us put those into wilderness those are appropriate wilderness or let us create a national park just like senator campbell and i did with the black canyon national monument we just converted it to a national park or let us create a new monument or let us make this a specialuse area or let us give this a species status a certain endangered protected status there is a reasonable ground in there what the president has done is laid his chip he has staked out his ground on this extreme to me that is as offensive as the people over here that stake out their claim that say we ought to be able to mine it at any cost let us go in and cut the timber we do not need selected timber cuts lets go in and cut it that is as extreme as the president is attempting to do over here for earth first and that is clearcut those forests abandon those forests and put them into the museum let us talk about a concept that is very important very important for the united states and for all of us to understand during my discussion this evening that is the concept of multiple use now many of us many of my colleagues may have never heard of what multiple use means well obviously one puts use together with multiple it means many uses many different kinds of uses remember just a couple of minutes ago in my comments i talked about skiing mountain biking rafting grazing grazing ones cattle timber mining lots of different uses wilderness environmental fishing things like that those are multiple uses i think this map is an excellent illustration if my colleagues can follow my red dot on the map obviously this is a map of the united states this is government lands my colleagues can see where the blob of government lands are they are not in the east there are some in the carolinas there are some up here in the northern part and illinois and the great lakes but the big bulk of federal lands are right here well when the united states acquired these lands through different acquisition methods the population was all along here in the east and they decided they needed to move the population to the west follow the red dot out to the west well when they got them out here to ohio and nebraska and kansas and texas oklahoma and some of these states out here those are pretty fertile states the way to encourage people to go out west when we wanted to settle the frontier back in the last century was to give them land grants or let them go out and put a stake in the ground and claim that land 120 acres or 160 acres let us go back to the map in these areas for example in kansas in nebraska in the dakotas out here in the midwest farm country one can support a family on 160 or 320 acres or some other type of government land grant but what was happening and washington was aware of it is there were not many people coming into the mountains they were not going into this area they wanted to settle this area of the west the question came up how do we encourage our pioneers to go to the west to go beyond the colorado rockies or to get into the rockies and into the mountains and go west how do we encourage people to settle shall we give them 160 acres under land grant like we have to settle the midwest and up to kansas and so on well the answer came back pretty simple one is dealing with different terrain the mountains cannot support per acre what the great plains states can support per acre so if we give 160 acres to somebody for agriculture and that was the driving industry obviously back then the agriculture and mining if we give it to them for agriculture they are not going to be able to make it off 160 acres in fact they need thousands of acres to do what somebody can do on 160 acres of real fertile land or 220 acres of real fertile land so they thought about it and said we cannot go out politically and it may not even be right to go out and give citizens several thousand acres of land simply through a land grant program what can we do how do we resolve this therein was the birth of multiple use that is a concept that concept was the government said okay and again follow my pen on the demonstration here the way we can get people to go up into this territory of the united states let us introduce this concept of multiple use which simply means that the government retains the ownership of the land we will call it public lands but the people have a right to use the landsnow when i grew up and when my father and mother grew up before me and so on down back in the generations there was a sign that hung out there we still see it once in a while but there was a sign that hung out there on public lands for example when one would go into the white river national forest one would see a sign that said welcome to the white river national forest underneath it hung a sign that said a land of many uses that is what the sign said today there is a very concentrated attempt to take off the sign that says a land of many uses throw it in the trash and put on a sign that says no trespassing that is the defeat of the concept of multiple use now maybe this would have worked i doubt it but maybe that no trespassing would have worked 150 years ago but the government itself this country itself encouraged its citizens encouraged its people to become pioneers go out and settle the west be cowboys be farmers help this country we need people in the west so generation after generation after generation including not only my family but my wifes family and our children has spent generations in those mountains that is how we make a living if one wants to put up ones no trespassing sign to those of us in the west one will break us we are not large in number we are large in heart we have got a lot of heart in our feeling about this but one will break us keep putting up that no trespassing sign unfortunately a lot of people that are encouraging that are these over here on this extreme that i spoke about earlier my colleagues have to imagine if they can pretend for a minute that they are a ranch owner that they own their own ranch there are several things that they need to do to be a responsible ranch owner number one they need to visit they need to go out into their fields they need to get their hand into the dirt number two they need to understand nature they need not to defy nature they need to work with nature nature renews a lot of natural resources such as water only if they treat it right so they have to understand nature the other thing that they have to do is manage different segments of that ranch they may want to manage the strawberry patch on their ranch a little different than they manage their grazing area where they have got their cattle well it is the same thing here the united states has millions and millions of acres in public lands let me give my colleagues some of those statistics ninetyone percent almost 92 percent of the land that the federal government owns almost 92 percent of the land that the federal government owns is in the western united states thirtyseven percent almost 37 percent of the land in the state of colorado primarily in the mountains is owned by the federal government the forest service the blm and the national park service manage 95 percent of this land the national wild and scenic rivers system contains 10 900 miles of wild scenic and recreational rivers we have got a lot of land out there and most of it is owned in the mountains by the federal government how do we manage that land what kind of management tools do we have let me talk to my colleagues about a few of them in order to manage federal land we do not need to lock everything up as some proposals like the president he says take 40 million acres again colleagues picture what 40 million acres is imagine how many people make a livelihood off of 40 million acres 40 million we have lots of ways we can manage that land and protect it so it looks just like the beautiful maroon bells that i just got done showing my colleagues or like the 54 peaks over 14 000 feet that i just got down showing you or the snowy scene in the colorado rockies that i just got done showing my colleagues we have ways to manage that land protect it for the future but reach that balance that teddy roosevelt spoke about teddy roosevelt said you have a right to develop that was the word back then of course it is a sin to use that word today but back then that is exactly the word that teddy roosevelt meant today we use the word use you have the right for use but you do not have the right for waste you dont have the right for abuse for destruction and he is right he is absolutely right well how do you manage this to help protect it we have national parks we have national monuments we have national preserves we have national reserves we have national lake shores national seashores national rivers national wild and scenic rivers i just told you elevensome thousand miles national scenic trails national historic sites national military parks national battlefield parks national battlefield site national battlefields national historic park reserve study areas national memorials national recreation areas national parkway coordination areas national forests national scenic areas national byways national scenic research area conservation research programs national research and experimental areas national grasslands national conservation areas special management areas national forest primitive areas national game refuges national wildlife preserve areas national wildlife refuges national wildlife protection areas we have lots of tools in our arsenal to manage these public lands we should not just go to one tool we should not put everything in a national park we should not put everything in a national wilderness mr president before you put 40 million acres 40 million acres in essence locking people out of it look at what the consequences are to the people who have preserved it all of these years it is very very important for us to understand a couple other ramifications not just the soil not just the land but right here with my cold tonight i have been sipping on water to keep my voice because i feel it very important to talk to you but that is water in colorado let me give my colleagues a little quote from the poet thomas ferrell it is in the colorado state capital i saw it when i served in the state legislature and the quote is here is a land talking about colorado here is a land where life is written in water here is a land where life is written in water colorado is a very unique state in colorado we must be overly protective of our water rights number one it is something that a lot of other people want colorado provides water for probably 18 to 23 other states believe it or not the country of mexico has water rights in the state of colorado for some of that water colorado is the only state in the union the only state in the union where all of our water goes out of the state we have no free flowing water that comes into the state for our usage in colorado we are an arid state an arid state meaning we do not get much rain when you look at those beautiful mountains you say wow it looks pretty rich to us but we do not have the kind of thick vegetation that a lot of my colleagues do in the east in their district in the east their problem is getting rid of water in the west our problem is storing water we have to store it because since we do not have much rain the only real opportunity we have for mass volumes of water is for the spring runoff assuming we get the winter snows and that spring runoff only lasts for about 65 maybe at the most 90 days so over the balance of time we have got to have it we have got to store it or we do not get it now what happens is that the water law in colorado is unique as well and the same for a lot of the western water law it is different than the east as i mentioned earlier it is entirely different but there are some organizations out there who understand this and those organizations really have two things in mind one stop any kind of use from the water and that is one way to drive people out of those mountains and the second thing is let us take the water for our own use i do not know many organizations in the east who have the interests of the people of the state of colorado or have the interests of the people in the west in mind when they look at our water rights they look at our water rights like a great big piece of apple pie and they are hungry and they think it ought to be theirs although they did not bake it or anything else they think it ought to be theirs so they put their arm around us and they talk to us friendly and they do all kinds of things but their goal is to put that apple pie in their mouth and keep it out of our stomach that is what their goal is so what do we do we have to be protective and when the president comes out and does as he did today set aside 40 million acres of public lands to essentially lock them up when he does that what are the implications to water in the west well i can tell my colleagues right now that the national sierra club that earth first and some of these kind of organizations their goal is that every acre he locks up ought to have with it implied water rights you ought to be able to reach outside that acre let us say this is an acre of land right here this is an acre of land they would like to have the government step outside of this acre up here or over here or over here to control water rights these are very very valuable rights and in essence what the next argument will be is hey we realize that president clinton back in 1999 set aside 40 million acres and certainly what he wanted to do is to also lock up the water necessary for all of those 40 million acres even though we may not be using the water for agriculture or anything we have certain water rights like we want the quality et cetera et cetera and they start reaching outside that territory it happened in colorado we have the wilderness act when the wilderness act was enacted by this congress by the united states house of representatives and of course the senate and the president there was never any kind of discussion of water rights in about 1985 judge cain out of the federal district court said although there were no water rights for the federal government although the federal government does not seem to have any automatic water rights there must have been an implication for water rights so the federal government now has implied water rights for the wilderness areas we have been fighting that battle for a long time same thing is going to happen here my colleagues now for you in the east my colleagues so what we need the water what do you mean so what that is our lifeblood remember my quote here is a land speaking of colorado here is a land where life is written in water here is a land where life is written in water it is a huge difference to us what are some of the other things that these 40 million acres can do the other implications we do not know but it could be all of a sudden there are air rights for the federal government all of a sudden the federal government could reach out to an adjacent town say silt colorado or grand junction colorado or glenwood springs colorado which borders the white river national forest or meeker colorado which borders the white river national forest on the north side and they could say to those communities you know something you have too many cars in your community you have too many people burning wood fireplaces and those communities could say we understand that we try and do our own no no no here is what the federal government out of washington d c is going to tell you communities in the west how you are going to run your communities there are lots of implications to the action that the president has taken today now what they will try and give you is an allusion that if we do not follow the presidents lead if we do not listen to the advice of earth first if we do not adopt point by point the national policies of the national sierra club that these beautiful mountains that i showed you a picture of will be destroyed that the water in the west will be polluted that the trees will be clearcutted well let me tell you what happens if we follow their agenda write off mountain biking forget skiing forget river rafting forget the other recreational uses that we have out there hunting going throughout in a 4wheel drive vehicle on marked trails all of the different kind of things that you can recreate with in colorado in the longrun those could very easily be diminished significantly maybe never ended completely because we have some private property although every ski area to the best of my knowledge and i have almost all of them in the third congress district in my district almost every one of them is on public land those are the kind of implications that we are speaking about here it sounds warm and fuzzy today and it is very easy to appeal to the entire country by saying what i have done is to do as teddy roosevelt or as i just heard somebody on tv say it is the most significant thing we have done for the environment in centuries do you know what the most significant thing we have done for the environment in centuries we have let the people that live in those mountains help manage those mountains we let the people who really have their hands in the soil every day now my hands are not in soil but take a look at my fatherinlaws hands or my motherinlaw or my parents or many many people out there in colorado i could give you name after name after name what we have done right is let those people who are on the ground there every day every hour help us manage those lands we did not kick them off now once in a while we have had abuse and we get rid of them and maybe we need to tighten the laws on that i am up for that and i am not for saying that we do not have additional areas out there where these kind of restrictions should be placed but 40 million acres by simply throwing a fishnet over the western united states that is what has happened the president got a big fishnet and just threw it as far as he could and out it floated over the western united states and wherever there is public lands haha we will lock it up i am not attempting here to be provocative to try and be derogatory what i am trying to do here is one make us all cognizant of what life in the western mountains is all about number 2 the fact that we have beautiful beautiful diamonds out there meaning the mountains and we all want to protect those and three i want to tell you do not just write us off we have too much to lose we are fellow citizens and we live in a beautiful large expansive area but there are not a lot of us out there so it may be pretty easy for many of my colleagues just simply to write us off but i am asking you not to do that take a look at what it really means what kind of impact you are going to have you are going to hear in the next few days many statements about how bad mountain bikes are i guess probably more realistically they will take some kind of thing that just on its face they will want to make it sound offensive logging for example you know i have known a lot of small families these are not the big logging companies these are small families that are in the logging business why do you want to wipe them out manage them do not wipe them out help them do not destroy them my gosh mr president i wish that you could go to dinner some night go to dinner tonight what you should have done is made this announcement of this lockup of this 40 million acres and then gone to dinner with a small family in colorado somewhere that cuts timber and does it responsibly how happy do you think they are tonight it is going to destroy some people out there but that will not happen the people in washington d c especially down the street are not going to take time to see what the impact is on people as my good colleague the gentleman from arizona said earlier this president committed to put people first they are not going to go out and see where it puts people instead it is much easier to be politically warm and fuzzy and say the west is being destroyed and we in the east must step into the west and defend it defend it against itself we have got to protect those people those families and pioneers out there in the west those ranchers those river rafters those hikers those skiers those residents that live out in the west we have got to protect them from themselves they are destroying themselves that is what the image is here in washington d c that is exactly what the image is that this president is trying to portray to you people with this sign with this signature of 40 million acres set aside in colorado most of us that live out there including myself my family my wifes family we are not wealthy people we are there because we have a job i have been fortunate i have a job representing those people but all five of my brothers and sisters all of my nieces and nephews all of my cousins there are probably 30 or 40 first cousins they are all over colorado why are we able to stay in colorado because we have a job we have a job that may not sound like a lot up here we get paid we have got an automatic job for 2 years back there some of these people depend on their jobs almost day to day let me give my colleagues an example of what kind of jobs we have in colorado on the white river national forest the white river national forest has two predominant uses twothirds of the forest the predominant use in twothirds of it is recreation in onethird of the white river national forest the predominant use is wilderness we have locked it up i voted for that and it was appropriate to do that but we intentionally left twothirds open for recreation why number one they do it in a responsible fashion two it provides resources that are not available you cannot put a ski mountain out in ohio they do not have a lot of skiing in kansas they do not have much skiing in mississippi or missouri or louisiana or nevada they have some in the sierras but not much colorado has got the natural resource for it what does that do that white river national forest just that forest thirtyfive thousand jobs my neighbors in a lot of cases have those jobs that is how we are able to stay out in colorado we are not johnnycomelately we did not just jump out to colorado all of a sudden to live our families many of our families have lived there for generations my family and my wifes family have lived there for many many generations but we still welcome people to come out to colorado sure we think it has grown too fast we wish it were not growing so fast but we do not think we have the right to shut the door because they did not shut the door on us back in the 1870s when my family came in or the 1880s when loris family came in they did not shut the door on us they said come on in but we only ask you one thing when you come to colorado or when you come to the rockies or utah wyoming or montana be responsible help us make this a good community to live in help us retain the beauty of this state help us follow what teddy roosevelt said and that is there is a right to use the land but there is not a right to destroy the land we think we can use the land the federal public lands in colorado or in the rockies or in the west in a responsible fashion i happen to think you can build a ski area and manage it in a responsible way many of you have skied in colorado many of your constituents have skied in colorado you have been there you have seen that a lot of those areas they are managed okay it has been a fun family vacation it was a nice way to recreate then when you take a look at the areas that are cleared for the ski runs they are just a pinpoint a pinpoint in the forest many of you have had the opportunity to river raft in the state of colorado or utah or wyoming or montana it is a blast if you have not done it do it it is a great time and it is a great family activity we have not destroyed the rivers we have been doing what teddy roosevelt said to do use it but dont destroy it some of you may have never heard of lake powell but many of you probably have do you know what lake powell has done for families in this country how many families are down there instead of having their kids running out to the mall or dad running down to work they are down together on a little boat on lake powell that lake does a lot it recreates use it but dont destroy it the roosevelt theory it is a lot different than the other theories that have come out when we talk about this when we talk about where we are going with the future i have got to tell you as long as i am in this elected office i am going to stand as strongly as i can for colorado and for water rights in the west i am not just saying that because never in my entire career have i felt more of a challenge to the taking of colorado water than i do today and never in my career have i felt more of a challenge to those 35 000 jobs on the white river national forest those are not indirect jobs those are direct jobs thatis not 35 000 in fact it is 35 000 families live off that forest i have never felt a larger threat in my political career to those jobs thar the visioncoming out of washington d c the vision that we cannot manage it the vision that theyneed to protect us to protect us from ourselves how many of you have ever mountain biked out in colorado that is a relatively new sport but if you have you have really gotten into some of that terrain and you have been able to access it you did not have to hike for miles you have been able to ride in there on your bike minimal damage to the environment we managed it well despite the fact that washington thinks they need to protect us from ourselves we followed the roosevelt theory use it but dont abuse it it is the same thing with any other type of activity you can imagine whether it is kayaking whether it is hiking and so on you get my message my drift what i am saying here now what about some of the other issues what about some of the other jobs i do not think it is shameful to have a sporting goods store and sell sporting goods in colorado i do not think it is wrong for a small family to try and go out and harvest some timber by the way if you harvest timber with correct management it is healthy for the forest it is a renewable resource and by the way every one of you in this room tonight every one of your constituents uses wood that istaken out of some forest somewhere at some time every chair in here you look around you know what i mean wood is everywhere it is a renewable resource but you have to follow the roosevelt theory the roosevelt theory is use it but dont abuse it it saddens me to think that here in washington d c frankly a lot of the national press is buying this hook line and sinker they are biting at it just like that it troubles me that back here in the east that even the administration in the west wing they do not go to the western united states they make this decision in the west wing they have got some confusion there it bothers me that they are using a deception upon the american people that this land out there that we are not taking care of that land it is public land it is all of our land i am telling you we have been on it for a long time we have lived on it for a long time we have worked it for a long time we have used it for a long time and we have not abused it for a long time folks do not be sold on this do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because of the fact that we have ski areas do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because we have mountain bikes do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because we allow peopl to river raft and hike and hunt do not automatically assume because it is not true we do follow the roosevelt theory use it but dont abuse it i know that tonight my time is rapidly expiring but i just want to reiterate a couple of things number one do not forget that the pioneer spirit still exists for a lot of us we are very proud of our heritage we are ameri cans but we also come from the west i feel very respectful of the people of the east but i am not an easterner i am a westerner i am not out here to destroy the lifestyle of the east and i ask you people in the east do not go out of your way to destroy our lifestyle in the west we do not need the eastern united states the bureaucracies in washington d c to protect us from ourselves i think we much much better than some of my colleagues and some of the people in the east understand that land much much better than you ever will we have got our hands in the soil all of us can agree that a commonsense approach is what is reasonable but that means that these people out here who want to clearcut every forest who want to put a ski area on every mountain who want to build a house on every ridge who want to put a highway wherever they want to who want to build townhouses wherever they want that means these people are going to have to be movedto the middle and the people out here like earth firstand other hardcore groups out there who think they only have the title to the environment who think they only have the knowledget to protect that land who think onlythey have the historical background to manage that ranch for all of us that group has also got to be brought to the middle and here in the middle is not the leader of the united states today the president of the united states bill clinton that is not who is here in the middle today he is over here what is in the middle today was what was in the middle at the turn of the century and many years ago and that is teddy roosevelt teddy roosevelt is who is in the middle and remember and i will conclude with teddy roosevelts comments and i will paraphrase him you have the right to use it but you dont have the right to abuse it or destroy it teddy roosevelt had it right it should be teddy roosevelts path that we follow do not be misguided down the path of president clinton follow the path of teddy roosevelt use it and enjoy it but dont abuse it and destroy it"], [2.3828652047086507e-05,

want to go and have a new building or tleman to come over here because it some kind of adjustment in their counseemed to be onesided the story we ty or some type of development they just heard go to their local county planning and i also would like to thank the gen zoning commission out here in these tleman with my colleagues here for the federal lands anything like that they considerations and the courtesies that have got to go to their planning board he has extended to the state of colo which is in washington d c so there rado over the years we appreciate his are a lot of significant issues that we service and his courtesies ask for our colleagues in the east to i interrupted my com have an understanding of what goes on ments because i felt it was very impor out primarily in the west or have an tant that we listen to the chairman of understanding of what goes on in the the committee on resources the gen state of alaska tleman who has represented the state for example in my district we are of alaska for a number of years alas totally dependent totally not parka is a wdnderful wonderful state tially totally dependent on multiple most of alaska i think in the high 90s use of public lands for water every maybe 96 percent of alaska is owned by highway that we have in my district the federal government i wish i had comes across federal lands the water time this evening to talk to my col when i go back to water it is either leagues about what happens and the stored upon originates or comes across differences between states that are pri federal lands all of our power lines marily owned by government and all of our cellular telephone towers all states that are primarily owned by pri of this is on federal lands in my parvate individuals ticular district of which we have the many of my colleagues here on the premier ski areas in the world aspen floor come from states where their pri or vail or telluride or powder horn or mary ownership in their state are pri purgatory i could go on and on and on vate individuals many of us come from these areas are dependent very dependstates where the primary ownership in ent our tourism dollars are very deour states is the federal government pendent on these lands we are very in colorado for example my district is very i guess you would say over a pethe third congressional district of the riod of time we have become encomstate of colorado my district geo passed by the concept of multiple use graphically is larger than the state of i want to talk just for a moment florida and on the eastern line of my about that concept of multiple use district which very simplified runs what happened in the early days when from wyoming down 125 to new mex our country was a young country we ico it exempts out the cities as you go basically had this as our country our down but from that eastern border to forefathers the leaders of our country the atlantic ocean that land there is wanted to settle the land that we had very little federal government owner purchased in those days possession ship of lands out here in the east you that is where the saying by the way have the appalachias you have the ev possession is ninetenths of the law erglades down there and then in a lot possession meant everything in the of states you have the local court early days of our country if you did house you may have a park here and not possess the land somebody else there but the reality of it is if we took could come in and they did not care a map for example of the united whether you had a deed or a document states and we looked obviously i am that said you own it they came in not an artist but if we took a look at they sat there with a gun and said i my eastern border here is colorado own that property the point i am making is from this once our country made purchases point right here to the atlantic ocean like through the louisiana purchase federal ownership or government own and things like that what happened ership of land is represented about like was taking this out for a moment this with the appalachias here the they were trying to figure out how to everglades the park up here in the get people to leave the relative comnortheast if you were to look from my forts of the east and of the settled border this district the third con communities in the east how do we gressional district and go to the pa get them out into the new frontier cific ocean you are going to find out how do we encourage people to go out that government ownership of land there and set up a home or set up looks like this obviously that is a towns because as a country we need to rough drawing but that is pretty sig possess the lands like the louisiana nificant purchase or we are going to lose them there are a lot of differences between to some other country living in areas where the ownership of so what they decided to do was let us the land is by individuals and living give land everybody in this country it out here where our zoning and planning is an americans dream to own a little commissions are dictated by decisions piece of land to own your own little out of washington d c for example house it is the american dream so they used this incentive go west young man go west to do that they said let us have a homestead you go out into kansas you go out into missouri you go out there you find 160 acres or you find 320 acres you farm it for enough years and you get to keep it it is your land that worked pretty well what we saw were fairly dramatic movements of population into these areas but when they got to the west where it is very arid we do not have the kind of water it does not rain in the west like it does in the east when they got out west the crowd started going around nobody was sticking around in here why because they discovered in kansas for example or missouri or even eastern colorado or down here in some of these states in the midwest states pennsylvania and so on they were discovering that with 160 acres you can support a family you have enough acreage there to grow a farm but they also discovered that when you got to the mountains for example or to the more arid acres sometimes 160 acres would not even feed one cow so the settlers were not staying there at the nations capital they said what do we do about this how do we get settlers out here before we lose this land how do we get them to move in there somebody came up with the idea it takes 160 areas of good fertile ground in missouri for a family that is the equivalent in the mountains of colorado it might take 2 000 acres so let us give them 2 000 acres they thought about it the policymakers back then and they said wait a minute we cant give that away that is too much for one person then the idea was born well let us go ahead and have the government retain the ownership in other words the government will continue to own this land out here but let us let the people use the land that is where the concept of multiple use came from when the gentleman the chairman of the committee on resources stands up and talks about alaska and talks about your oil that is why alaska is primarily owned by the government because of the fact of the differences between states in the west and states in the east and so i think it was important i acknowledge the gentleman and appreciate him coming to speak with us i want to address another point i had the opportunity to come down and listen to some of my respected colleagues prior to my having the opportunity to visit with you it sounded like it was the george w bush bash hour what can we bash george w bush about that seems to be a favorite thing by some of my colleagues here lately what policy can we find of george w bush lets just bash him somebody ought to stand up here and say a few things that george w bush is doing right and a few ideas that i think will work for this country on a bipartisan basis that both sides of the aisle ought to acknowledge let us take an example let us talk about social security for example social security we ought to look a little at the history we know that we had the depression in 1929 in 1935 the president decided and this country and this congress on this floor decided that we should have a national insurance policy a social insurance that is where social security came about but there are a few factors to remember about social security when it was first conceived number one for every person that was retired in 1935 we had 42 workers out there working fortytwo workers for every person retired what has happened over a period of time is the number of people that are working has gone down in proportion to the number of people that are retired today instead of being 42 to one today it is three to one it is three to one that has created a problem for social security number two and this is good news for all of us colleagues this is good news the modern medicine that we have developed and the vaccines and the ability to fight things like chicken pox and polio and things that were horrible diseases of the past and with godspeed we can find a cure for cancer in the future but these diseases have in a large part been conquered the average person in the united states in 1935 could expect to live a male 62 years old a female 65 today that is almost in the 80s we have had a dramatic increase in the life span for our citizens in this country unfortunately no adjustment has ever been made in social security number one because of the number of active workers that have been reduced and two because of the extended life span of these individuals so what is happening is today we have a social security fund which on a cash basis means cash in the bank is in the plus column but when we look on an actuarial basis and what do i mean by that word i mean when we look into the future and say okay here is the money we have here are our future obligations do we have enough money to cover all of these future obligations that is what is called actuarial thinking on an actuarial basis social security is bankrupt and who is the individual that is running for president that has stood up and i think in a bipartisan approach come up with a plan now it is a bold plan gore and the president they have called it a risky plan you have got to take some risk you have got a plan that is in trouble not in trouble for my generation i am 47 not in trouble for my parents my parents are going to be guaranteed any of the colleagues any of your seniors their money is not going to be interrupted really from about 45 on up their money is going to be there but the young people of this country the people that george w bush has talked about the people in their 30s the young workers that are starting out in their 20s those are the people that are going to face the dramatic problem on social security if we do not take a bold move you can call it risky as al gore has called it but the fact is you have got to do something that is what leadership is about if you do not want to lead stand aside we are not going to leave you behind but you are not a leader somebody has to get out there with a bold plan i can tell you that the plan that george w bush has proposed is not exactly in my opinion something that is novel you say what do you mean novel well i think that george w bush and his social security plan they looked around and said go~h how do we test market my proposal how do we test market something for the younger generation that will save social security you know what they found it it has been test marketed it has been out there and used you know what it is working the logical question that one would ask is well where is this test market where are the results who is using the same type of basic plan that george w bush is proposing for all of america where is your test market on that you know when corporations or businesses or people want to try a product they go out and test it first so you prove to us mcinnis where is this test market you know where it is it is right here on the house floor us you know what we are treated differently than other americans every federal employee is treated differently than other americans how we have our own separate retirement plan now we are participants in social security and we do pay into social security but as you know we have another plan every federal employee 3 million of us in this country have been test marketed and that plan is called the thrift savings plan what is the thrift savings plan number one it is voluntary you are not required to participate in it exactly what george w bush is saying with the partial investment of social security dollars number two it gives you choice exactly what george w bush is talking about when he talks about his social security plan number three it guarantees you a payment regardless of the choice that you make exactly what we have in our thrift savings plan and exactly what george bush has proposed in his plan how does the thrift savings plan work as you know we get our check and there is an automatic deduction taken out of our check for social security there is also an automatic deduction taken out for our retirement so as a federal employee and remember this applies to all federal employees not just to the congress but to about three million federal employees so they take out a small amount or an amount out of your check for your retirement you have no choice on that you get no choice as to where it is invested you do not get a choice as to whether it goes into the stock market or whether it goes into bonds you have no choice on it on the other hand the tradeoff is you are guaranteed a payment when you retire but then after that is said and done you get to take up to 10 percent of your pay and you can invest it through the thrift savings plan and the federal government will match the first 5 percent so you get to take 10 percent they match the first 5 percent and you get choice you are not required to do it by the way and what kind of choices do we have our choices are one you can go into savings accounts which are guaranteed by the government just like if you went to a local bank fdic approved you get that but the return is low the lower the risk the lower the return the higher the risk the higher the return the very low risk option zero risk almost and you get a low return or you can go into something like the bond or the stock market you have that choice what is wrong with george w bushs proposal to give choice to the american people what is wrong with our generation the older generation looking to the younger generation like my children my children are grown now what is wrong with my generation saying to this generation hey you ought to have a little choice we ought to give you a choice on some of your investment dollars george w bush has not gone out and said take all the social security dollars and let this young generation decide if they want to put it all in the stock market of course that would be reckless conduct that would be careless there is not a financial mind in the world that would tell you that would be a smart thing to do what george w bush said is give them up to 2 percent let us try it out it works for american government employees why can it not work for the young generation the women in this country that are young and just getting into the workplace the young men and the families if we do not do something do you know what the return is if we stick with the status proposed which seems to be what is proposed by the al gore policy here is what your return is 0 09 percent that is a rotten return that is what you get to expect assuming that we can keep it afloat so a young couple today let us say a young lady named joyce and a young man named john and john and joyce go out into the workplace and their social security if we do not change this thing number one it probably on an actuarial basis will not be there for them and if it is if the stock market continues to boom and we know in case you have not read in the last few weeks it has leveled off but if it continued to boom which it will not do forever then that is about what kind of return you can expect how can we do this come on it is an obligation it is a fiduciary duty on every one of us in this room to stand up for this next generation behind us and the generation behind them and the generation behind them if we are going to hive a social security program let us give them a social security plan that works for the american people let us not make american federal government employees an exclusive set where they have a little different arrangement than the very people who put us here the people that pay our checks are the taxpayers we ought to take that into consideration we should not treat the taxpayers of this country who are not federal employees different than we treat federal employees why not change social security i see positive things instead of standing up here in a very partisan way and bashing george w bush why do we not stand up here and talk about what i think are the good policies and the good recommendations that he has made if he becomes the president i think you are going to see a very positive change for social security those policies will work because they have been test marketed it is not new it did not just fall out of the sky these policies work they have been tested and they have been tested on 3 million people and do you know what the participation rates are in the high 80 or 90 percent of federal employees that want to get into this program because why because it works that is why they want to get into this program let me change subjects because i heard some other bush bashing going on and i think once again somebody has to come tell the other side of the story paul harvey who by the way i had the privilege of meeting paul harvey a couple of weeks ago in pueblo colorado where we honored about 100 medal of honor recipients and paul harvey was kind enough to come out there at his expense to speak to us but paul harvey has a famous saying you have all heard it and now for the rest of the story that is exactly why i am over here this afternoon talking to you you heard one side of the story bush bashing bush bashing on social security bush bashing on taxes bush bashing look do you know what there are a lot of good things in there why not look for some 6f the good colleagues instead of trying to spin it out of control because of the political necessities of an election coming up here in 4 or 5 weeks let us talk about taxes and let us talk about what the republicans frankly with a lot of help from conservative democrats have done with their tax policy number one the republicans again with help from conservative democrats who came across the aisle we sent to the president of this country a death tax elimination now whetheror not you think you are covered by the death tax i think it is a fundamental question it is the same thing by the way with the marriage tax elimination the republicans with help from some conservative democrats sent to the president of the united states a marriage tax elimination to eliminate the tax because of the fact you are married and to eliminate the tax because of your death on both occasions the president vetoed both of them now let us talk about it the basic fundamental question you need to ask about the death tax and the fundamental question you need to ask about the marriage tax is should death or marriage should those be taxable events in our society you know what the majority of us stood up and said no unfortunately the administration disagreed they think that marriage should bea taxable event they think that death is a taxable event not only do they think death is a taxable event i sit on the committee on ways and means i know about finance and taxes the presidents budget the president and vice president the clintongore budget this year not only did not even consider elimination of the death tax they actually proposed an increase of 9 5 billion a 9 5 billion increase in the death tax you should not increase it you should not keep it the death tax does not collect a lot of money let me tell you when you hear and i have heard this over and over again when you hear wvell this only benefits the upper 2 percent of a community wake up it does not just affect 2 percent of the community let me give an example colorado you take a small town in colorado i have a small community in colorado where somebody who by the way lived the american dream started out with nothing worked all his life his entire dream in life was to be successful so he could pass it on to the next generation and spread it in the community he had a construction company by the way to be eligible for the death tax on a construction company if you own free and clear if you own much more than a bulldozer a dump truck and a backhoe then all of a sudden you are facing the death tax that is right a bulldozer backhoe and dump truck and you are facing the death tax this individual passed away from what you would hear from the people who think that the death tax is a fair tax that it is fair to tax somebody on property they have accumulated that they have already paid taxes on simply by the fact that they died what you need to look at is what the impact is on a community what happened when he died they took 70some percent 55 percent of it for the death tax 22 percent on capital gains or 28 percent excuse me on capital gains and they took 70some percent of that estate and moved it out of this small town in colorado and they moved that money to washington d c to be redistributed by a bureaucracy you know what the money in a community ought to stay in a community i do not believe you ought to be able to tax death as a taxable event but it sure would be a lot more liveable if you went to that small community and said look just in spite you had somebody who was successful so we are going to tax them on their death but you get to keep the money in the community remember the death tax where it came from the death tax came as kind of a geteven tool with the carnegies and the fords and the rockefellers that is where that thing came from from people who wanted to declare class warfare who said look this is a great country and we say if you invent the better mouse trap you get to reap the reward as long as you do not reap too many rewards because then we are going to come after you that is exactly what happened in the twenties and so on this is a tax that should never have been created it is a tax that hurts our communities it is a tax that hurts our environment this is a country that ought to pride itself in encouraging its citizens encouraging its families to pass abusiness from one generation to the next generation what builds the strength of a country is family that is what builds our strength and for a government to go out and discourage and actually penalize the transfer of a business or the family farm or the family hardware store from one generation to the next generation is fundamentally flawed it is flawed with the concept of what we have as government now maybe in a communist country or in a socialist country where everybody is not paid on what they are worth they are paid on what they need so no matter what they do it is not what they do for society it is what they need so you equalize all those payments that is what the concept of a death tax or a marriage tax comes from especially a death tax that is not what we want in this country that is not what ought to be happening to our communities by the way you heard me right when i tell you the death tax hurts our environment you say wait a minute how does the death tax hurt our environment you know how it hurts it in my district in colorado a beautiful district i live in the highest place in the nation the highest elevation in the nation if you have been skiing in the mountains in colorado if you have been in the mountains in colorado the essence is you are in my district the people discover the beauty of this what happened is we have family farms and ranches out there and what is happening is people are coming in and the families are having to sell these they want to farm they want to ranch they want to have that piece of land but they have to sell it you know where that land goes it does not continue as a ranching operation it does not continue as a farming operation it continues as a few hundred more condominiums or a few hundred more townhouses or a brand new shopping center that is what is happening to that land out there and a lot of it is due directly to this death tax so do not stand here and bash george w bush because he wants to eliminate the death tax do not stand here and bash george w bush because he says marriage should not be a taxable event what you ought to do is as some of the democrats have done join the republicans in our fight to get rid of the death tax join the republicans as some conservative democrats have done and get rid of the marriage tax instead what happened unfortunately we saw the majority of democrats go with the president and support the presidents veto of getting rid of the marriage tax and support the president on this death tax i am saying to my colleagues work with us in a bipartisan method we can do something for social security for this next generation we can do something about that death tax we can do something about that marriage penalty let me tell my colleagues in a bipartisan direction when we have worked together in the past the democrats helped us pass probably the largest tax break that we have had in 20 years or 30 years although the people do not realize what we have done the republicans about 3 years ago 2 years ago went out and said the americans dream is about owning their own home so we think in most families the ownership of the home is the largest asset they have that is usually the largest asset in a family what we said the republican bill that we got passed with some help from some conservative democrats on a bipartisan working effort the bill we passed says that if you now own a home and you sell that home for a profit i am not talking about equity i am talking about net income you sell it for a profit your first 250 000 per person remember most homes are owned by couples so it is the first 500 000 per couple but the first 250 000 per person goes into your pocket tax free you get to do that every 2 years that is an incentive for people to go out and own homes and that was supported on a bipartisan effort we had conservative democrats who helped the republicans pass that and that gave the american people a tax break they deserved for some reason there has been a misconception down here on this floor we seem to think that the american taxpayers ought to pay and pay and pay and somehow people some of my colleagues spin it out as if we dare talk about it hey maybe they put in too much george w bush says take half of our surplus right away and put it to reduction of the debt that should be our priority reduce that debt but you still have a little that you ought to put into some programs like education and healthcare and you still have a small fraction of that you ought to give back to the taxpayer pat them on the back and say thanks for what you have done thanks to the productive nature of the american people the american taxpayer this government is sitting pretty well this surplus was not created by the wonderful creative thoughts of your government it was created by our constituents the hard workers the 8 00 to 5 00 people or the 8 00 to 8 00 people out there who produce and create capital government does not create capital government transfers capital government takes it from the workers pockets transfers it to washington d c and then hands it out as if they worked for it that is not what the government is about what i am saying is do not be ashamed to talk about a tax cut they ought to be reasonable tax cuts is it unreasonable to cut out the tax of death is it unreasonable to cut out the tax of marriage i was so excited last night in that debate i wanted to be in that debate not as a candidate but just to get up there and say wait a minute mr vice president what is wrong with the policy of cutting out a death tax what is wrong with the policy of eliminating the marriage tax what is wrong with the homeowners tax break that we gave 2 years ago you did not try and spin it out of control then i am telling my colleagues from a bipartisan point of view we owe respect to the taxpayer and there is no reason to back off and be ashamed because we talk about maybe we ought to thank the taxpayer and say we got enough to operate the government the more the taxpayer provides for the government the sloppier the government becomes sometimes it is a good idea to tighten down on the budgets that forces efficiencies that is why i have taken this podium today instead of bashing bush all the time which i heard minute after minute after minute earlier this afternoon why do we not stand up and say hey here are some policies that we can work on in a bipartisan basis here are some positive things that he has proposed there are very few of my colleagues out here who could look me right in the eye and arguably tell me that our plan our thrift savings plan should not apply to the american people and should only apply to federal government employees there are very few of you i think that could really look me in the eye and honestly tell me look scor we ought to have a death tax how many of my colleagues really support a death tax how many of my colleagues really think people ought to be penalized in tax due to the fact that they are married how many of my colleagues really think that this government ought to engage in discouraging families from passing their hardware store or their farm or ranch from one generation to the next generation not a lot of my colleagues but my colleagues ought to be identified to the american people so they know exactly where we stand the taxpayer does deserve some courtesy we obviously need to reduce the death debt we have to take care of programs like education and health care which are fundamental for the survival of the greatness of this country but the best way that we do it is we look at it in a positive sense and i encourage my colleagues to do just exactly that"], [2.7104928449261934e-05, 2.7104928449261934e-05, 0, "i yield myself the balance of my time this legislation is truly landmark legislation i have listened to some of the criticisms from the other side of the legislation and i have been pleased to see the bipartisan character of its support every one of the objections that have been raised to this legislation have been before this house in the past and have been set aside they should not deter us from moving forward and doing the right thing because this legislation will place a new emphasis in this house on distressed communities it will give those distressed communities and their inhabitants the opportunity to participate in our national growth and in our national opportunity we have an opportunity to move opportunities to where the needs are that is something that at a time of rising growth and rising tides we need to make a priority if our society is going to create opportunity for americans and focus not only on liberty but also on equal opportunity in passing this legislation we will give thousands of lowincome americans a stake in the american dream and as we do so we have an opportunity to greenline many of our distressed communities all too often in the past our distressed rural and urban communities have experienced redlining a loss of opportunity for investment today we are creating incentives which would effectively greenline those communities and attract new investment new jobs and new opportunity and create new tools to allow local people to design local institutions to their needs in western pennsylvania we have communities in my district like farrell pennsylvania and some of the neighborhoods even of my hometown of erie who could benefit enormously from these new nonbureaucratic tools we have passed many tax bills in this house we have passed a marriage penalty credit we have passed pension reform we have passed a taxpayer bill of rights too we have passed small business incentives and we voted to eliminate the death tax we have gotten rid of an antiquated phone tax in action in the house and

deprived of their basic rights by their government by the iranian government despite the fact that they are committed to nonviolence tolerance and loyalty to government the bahais continue to suffer deprivations and harassment from the fanatical elements of iranian society ranging from local clergy and their uneducated followers to highly placed government officials eleven bahais continue to languish in iranian prisons arrested tried and sentenced as a result of their personal religious beliefs and peaceful religious activity bahai religious gatherings and administrative institutions were banned in 1983 a 1991 government document calls for the continued obstruction of the economic and social development of the bahai community the iranian constitution recognizes only four rellgions islam christianity judaism and zoroastrianism and official rhetoric continues to name those as the only religions whose members may enjoy full rights bahais continue to be denied government employment denied university employment denied legitimately earned pensions denied admission to iranian universities denied access to the legal system denied access to decent places to bury their dead and a host of other civil liberties that we in our nation have come to take for granted as basic elements of a free and just society the election of president khatami in iran and the subsequent relaxation of the clerical dictatorship have brought hope that the rule of law will eventually prevail in that nation and that full rights will be granted to all of its citizens including the bahais we have seen some improvement in the treatment of individual bahais in the last 2 years bahais have been granted passports for travel abroad more frequently and some have been granted business licenses again a significant concession to the bahais was a recent modification of the rules of registration of marriages that now omits references to religion allowing bahais to register marriages and legitimize their children for the first time in many years those steps are significant and they should be acknowledged as signs of promise for full emancipation to come in the future yet those actions have been taken silently and come far short of granting bahais the recognition under the constitution the iranian constitution that would improve their situation and protect them from fanaticism we look to president khatami to stand behind his promise of iran for all iranians and to take steps to extend the protection of his constitution to the bahais by granting those rights guaranteed by the universal declaration of human rights and the international covenants on human rights we cannot remain silent when a community of 300 000 people continues to suffer the effects of persecution and deprivation

international affairs and the committee on banking and financial services and other committees of this congress the committee on government reform what impact if any the unitedstates has had in the current economic and political turmoil inside of russia and the former soviet states let me say at the outset this is an issue that i have discussed many times on this floor in the past and i do not just come here tonight to criticize this administration although some of my comments will appear to do just that i come to offer some suggestions for perhaps a new way of dealing with russia in fact what i come to offer tonight is a new vision for russia a new way that this country can relate to the people in russia who have been dominated by a centrallycontrolled communist regime for 70 years and for the last 6 years or 7 years actually by a government that was totally focused on boris yeltsin and the people around him i want the same thing for the russian people that the president wants and that is a stable free democracy a free market system allowing the people of russia to enjoy the benefits that we in the west and we in america enjoy i want them to be trading partners of ours i want them to reap the benefits of free markets and i want them to become a partner with us in helping to ensure world stability prom my position as chairman of the national security research committee my job is to oversee 38 billion a year of defense spending for new weapon systems and new technologies and money of those technologies and much of that investment is focused on threats either perceived or real coming from russia and the former states so it is my interest as a subcommittee chairman to try to find ways to work with russia so that perhaps we can create a more stable relationship not have to spend so much of the taxpayers money on building exotic new weapon systems that are designed to kill people let me say at the outset i think we made a fundamental mistake in 1991 the russia that people were so excited to throw off communism they were so happy to finally be able to have the opportunity to enjoy the kind of democracy and free market capitalism that they saw us enjoying in the west and in those first few months we were so excited with the leadership provided by boris yeltsin and all of us were solidly behind him at the time that i think we forgot one very important and basic notion that russias success as a democracy was not dependent upon one man it was not going to depend upon boris yeltsin but rather we should have focused on upon helping russia establish the institutions of a democracy that would last beyond one person if we look at america we can see that quite evident in our history yes we have had great leaders from george washington to abraham lincoln fdr ronald reagan all good pedple but americas success is not based on individual people and the work that they do it is based on the institutions that allow our government to have a system of checks and balances it is based on a constitution it is based upon the institutions mandated in that constitution that allow people to assume positions but that the institution can never be circumvented by those individual people in our rush to help boris yeltsin i am convinced that our focus was wrongheaded we were so preoccupied with reinforcing boris yeltsin the man that we forgot that russia could not and would not succeed and become more stable unless we focused on institutions and strengthening those institutions in fact it is no surprise to me that for 7 years as boris yeltsin called the parliament in russia the lower house the state duma and the upper house the federation council repeatedly called them a bunch of misfits and rogues and crooks and thugs and while there may be one or two in that duma or perhaps more that would fit those categories what we did as a country was reinforce yeltsins notion of what the russian parliament was that it was not an institution to be taken seriously and therefore the president largely through his policies of reinforcing boris yeltsin sent a message to the russian people and to the elected leaders of the state duma that americas policy was based on a strong yeltsin and that we were not in fact concerned with helping to strengthen the institution of the state duma and the federation council and those institutions that would allow russias constitution and the russian government to stabilize itself and now we are paying the price for that yeltsins popularity in the most recent poll in russia is 2 percent in fact one poll had him being disliked by the entire electorate which is something i cannot believe that everyone in russia that would be polled would say that yeltsin was not good for russia as a nation and that in fact he should be replaced but the most recent poll that i see provided by one of our think tanks here in washington showed yeltsins acceptance rate in russia at 2 percent now that leaves us as a country that has been russias closest partner in this new experiment in democracy as a country that has totally reinforced yeltsin at the expense of the support for other institutions inside of russia and therefore with yeltsins popularity plummeting at 2 percent it is no surprise that the russian people and the russian duma and the federation council see america as an equal partner to the problems that boris yeltsin has brought to russia the problems of the threat of billions of dollars of imf money the problem of the misappropriation of dollars that were supposed to go to help stabilize russias economy and help create a middle class the problems of a russia that has not had control of its technology and has allowed proliferation to occur on an ongoing basis so now we find ourselves in a very difficult position that the russia that is in fact no longer supportive of boris yeltsin in fact no longer has trtist for americas interests we do not have to just look at the words that support this just a few short months ago there were thousands of russian young people old people standing outside of our embassy in moscow throwing rocks and bricks at the american embassy something we had never seen even under communism we did not see massive demonstrations against our country but recently in the last several years that is exactly what we have seen in fact i think one of the russian duma members perhaps summed it up best when he was visiting washington in may of this year i stood next to him at a press conference and he was talking about the russian perception of our involvement in kosovo and this is what he said he said you know america for 70 years the soviet communist party spent tens of billions of dollars to convince the russian people that america was an evil nation and that american people were evil and they failed but he said you know in just a few short months and a few short years your administration has done what the soviet communist party could not do it has convinced the russian people that americas intentions are not honorable that in fact you have supported yeltsin every step of the way even when hes been out of line even when he has overseen the misuse of dollars even when friends the oligarchs who started and who run many of the russian banks have in fact siphoned money away from the russian people put it into swiss bank accounts and unitedstates real estate investments leaving the russian government and the russian people to pay those loans back even though that money was misappropriated is it any wonder that our policies in regard to russia have not been successful now there are committees of this body and the other body holding hearings that started in september and will continue through the end of october and november about russia some would characterize these hearings as who lost russia i am one that is convinced that russia is not yet lost but i do think it is certainly appropriate for the american people and its leaders to look at what happened and what went wrong in my humble opinion there is no doubt that this administration has to bear a significant part of the responsibility for russias economic and political turmoil today but we cannot just stop by pointing fingers at this administration because the logical response is well what would you have done differently it is easy to criticize but what different approach would you take and also the criticism would be such that the administration would say well hindsight is always 2020 it is easy to say what we could have done but where were you while these last 7 years unfolded well that is why i rise tonight because over the past 7 years i have not been silent in fact 6 years ago working with the russian members in the state duma i started a caucus to deal with russians on energy because i knew that helping them develop their energy resources was the quickest way to bring in hard currency to help stabilize russias economy and so working with those duma deputies from energyrich regions we got our energy companies together occidental mobil marathon the key companies that wanted to do business in russia to see if we could not encourage joint ventures and in the process encourage the duma to pass production sharing laws which they did twice to allow american companies to invest in russian energy and it was 5 years ago that we began a process of engaging the duma on russias environmental problems to make sure that we were helping russia deal with its nuclear waste issues and the problems of clean air and clean water and maintaining an environment for the russian people to live and to work in and it was the day that the current speaker of the russian duma was elected to that post that i was in moscow almost 6 years ago with a letter from then speaker gingrich inviting the speaker of the russian duma to engage the congress in a formal way an institutional relationship with the congress so that we could begin the process of helping strengthen and helping to empower the parliament in russia so that it could play its rightful role in making sure that russias democracy succeeded for the past 6 years working with my colleague on the other side the gentleman from maryland we have led delegation after delegation to moscow and st petersburg and we have hosted delegation after delegation to washington we have discussed issues that confront us and we have discussed opportunities to join together but we have worked together in an effort to strengthen the duma to make it a more powerful force in the governing of russia it was 5 years ago that i brought over then general alexander lebed who is today the governor of krasnoyarsk i brought him over to testify 5 years ago of what he thought was happening in the yeltsin government 5 years ago and he said before this congress and my committee that the current administration was corrupt and following general lebeds testimony i brought over the leading russian environmental activist alexei yablakov dr yablakov himself a member of the academy of sciences and at two hearings on the public record he said that the leadership in russia was corrupt that it was siphoning off money that should have been going to the russian people and he begged america to come in and help establish proper oversight that was not last year it was not last month those hearings were 3 4 5 and 6 years ago we in the congress have been telling this administration repeatedly that its policies were g6ing in the wrong direction that reinforcing boris yeltsin as a person as opposed to reinforcing institutions of the presidency of the parliament and of the constitution in russia would eventually cause us major problems it was 3 years ago that i brought in stanislav lunev the highest ranking defector from the soviet russian intelligence service to talk about some of the continuing problems that russia was going through and how we needed to be aggressive in dealing with russia to ask candid questions so over the past 5 6 7 years this congress has repeatedly questioned the policies of this administration relative to our embracing boris yeltsin embracing him under any circumstance fearful of embarrassing him and that has been our policy for the last 7 or 8 years actually starting with the last year of president bush and then beginning with the leadership of president clinton we have seen a consistent policy of reinforcing one man instead of the institutions that russia needs to strengthen itself so that it may survive for a long period of time much like america has survived so with those thoughts in mind a year ago i traveled to moscow because i knew at that time that the russian duma was opposed to any more imf funding going into their country now imagine that here the elected russian leaders equivalent to our congress who were about to receive another 4 billion in outside aid from the international monetary fund and here they were standing up all seven major factions saying to the world we do not want anymore imf funding we do not want any more dollars coming into our country now at the same time the unitedstates congress has been saying the same thing in fact for 8 months president clinton could not get the support in the congress to support additional imf funds to replenish the ones that had been committed why would the russian duma members oppose more imf funding for their own homeland the reason is very simple because for the previous 5 and 6 years duma members had seen billions and billions of dollars go into russia that were designed and supposedly earmarked to help russian people and time and time again they saw those dollars simply flow through the system through the oligarchs running the banking system in moscow many of whom were yeltsins friends and back out the other side where were the dollars going to unitedstates bank accounts to unitedstates real estate investments to swiss bank accounts to the russian people in some cases who were former leaders of the communist party and the kgb who had offshore accounts in fact there are reports being investigated today that boris yeltsin himself and his family had secret bank accounts where they have stashed significant amounts of money for his retirement days so it was no surprise that the russian leaders said we do not want any more we do not want any more of your money with those thoughts in mind and realizing that if we did not get additional imf dollars into russia their economy would collapse i traveled to moscow and i took with me eight points because i was convinced that if i could convince the duma to accept a new direction in dealing with russia that perhaps we could bring some discipline and some new direction for the way that russia was moving to my surprise the duma deputies that i met with and worked with representing various factions agreed to all eight points last week i submitted those eight points in the form of legislation i want to review those eight points tonight because i think they represent a new direction for the unitedstates in terms of dealing with russia the joint statement of principles governing western and foreign assistance to russia is simple but i think it is profound in fact i have introduced it and it is out now h r 3027 for those members who would like to become cosponsors the eight principles lay out a new direction in terms of our relationship with russia both monetarily and in terms of dealing with them on issues of transparency the first is a simple one and that is to establish a joint russianunitedstates legislative oversight commission to monitor all western resources going into russia today there is no such effort today we have no capability to monitor inside of russia where the dollars are going the dollars from the international monetary fund the dollars from the world bank and the dollars from the unitedstates taxpayer i might add we put approximately 1 billion a year of unitedstates taxpayer money into russia much of it through the cooperative debt reduction program other money through our militarytomilitary efforts environmental cooperation and cooperation with russia in helping them stabilize their economy so we in fact directly and indirectly put billions of dollars into russia every year there is today no ability for the unitedstates congress and the russian duma to monitor where those dollars end up now the administration would have us believe that they can watch over where the money is going but i would say this not being able to trust the russian regime of boris yeltsin which i think is a uniform given right now i think everyone understands and it has certainly been pronounced in the press as just several weeks ago we saw the first indictments handed down in the new york bank case where there is expected defrauding of up to 4 billion to 5 billion of imf money for the bank of new york that was assisting some of yeltsins friends in moscow we need to have the capability inside of russia one that understands the russian process but is backed up by the integrity of the unitedstates the only way to accomplish that is to get the russian parliament the duma and the federation council to join with the congress in establishing a bilateral commission separate from our two governments separate from bill clinton and separate from boris yeltsin whose only purpose would be to monitor where the monies are going not to determine where they go because we do not want congressional interference in saying that money should go to this agency versus that that is up to the two administrations whether it would be clinton or yeltsin or their successors there needs to be a process where our two elected parliaments representing both political parties in america and representing all of the political factions in russia can monitor where the dollars are ending up in russia the russians love that recommendation because the duma today has no input in terms of monitoring where the money has gone and where it is going today and where it will go in the future the second principle was to focus western resources on programs like housing that will help to develop a russian middle class now over the past 7 or 8 years we have pumped billions of dollars into russia do we see a housing industry developing absolutely not to date russia does not even have an established mortgage program three years ago the gentleman from north carolina"], [3.5072964237770066e-05, 3.5072964237770066e-05, 0, "i rise today

environmental problems the gentleman and i share support for this i understand that he may have some differences on the amendment i think what this amendment does it takes a number of groups that are committed to environmental policy and takes away their opposition from what is a very solid program i think if we can show sensitivity to those environmental concerns which i think the gentleman shares it will not hamper opics operations it will provide that we will not end up in an embarrassing situation where we are doing some environmental damage in some developing country and that both the gentlemans desires and mine will be met we will have an opic that has broader support that does the right things and achieves the economic and policy goals the united states is interested in"],

and achievements of the committee on banking and financial services i want to thank the gentleman from iowa chairman leach the gentleman from nebraska the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from new york and the ranking member the gentleman from new york they have left their mark on this congress in some significant and bipartisan ways and it is a pleasure to serve with each of them i thank them for their cooperation and the cooperation of the staff in bringing this bill to the floor in the spirit in which the committee has proceeded throughout this congress to understand the importance of this bill we need to understand what it would be like to be a family with an income of 26 000 or 27 000 a year living in a modest home in a rural area of the united states struggling to pay the bills struggling to keep up and confronting a mortgage payment each month that reflects a mortgage of 11 or 12 percent many people in those circumstances would take advantage of recent changes in financial conditions and refinance their mortgage they would go out and get a loan and pay off their existing mortgage and they would replace it with one that requires lower monthly payments there are a lot of significant reasons why the citizens that i talk about cannot do that first of all they probably have a very low income as i said and secondly they build up very little equity in their home because the way they build up equity is to either live in a house that is appreciating regularly in value or by making early payments against their mortgage that would pay down the principle more quickly than they would interest neither of those happy developments is happening for many of the people who we are talking about affected by this bill presently the law does not permit the united states department of agriculture to issue a loan guarantee or a direct loan in order to facilitate the refinancing of that mortgage loan this bill changes that it says that the united states department of agriculture can step in and subject to its guidelines and to the other conditions set forth by the ranking member can issue a loan guarantee or where appropriate a direct loan what does that mean to the family that i talked about at the outset of my remarks well it may mean up to about 100 a month in lower mortgage payments 100 a month more for health care or for education or to meet the other demands of the household this is a sensible bipartisan approach to a problem that is affecting a lot of people as we heard previously there are 65 000 borrowers across the country who are paying interest rates in excess of 9 h percent and there are 9 100 of those borrowers paying interest rates in excess of 13 percent this is a modest measure that will help those families in a significant way

majority to allow any amendments to this bill indeed if i had my preference this would not be a motion to recommit there was a consensus measure worked out in a bipartisan fashion by the gentleman from maryland the gentleman from pennsylvania and others but it is not germane to the bill when the committee on rules would not allow that as an amendment this became our only choice for recommittal but i offer it anyway even though in the eyes of many even if it passed it would not make the bill fully acceptable but it would clearly make it less damaging because here is what the bill does in the form in which it was presented it says that even if in the opinion of the physician a failure to use this procedure in these circumstances could result in severe physical harm to the mother he could perform it only at risk of going to prison it shows how extreme the bill is and i stress that because there are many who believe that this is a right a woman should have untrammeled legislatively who think this is too much this amendment that i offer of an impingement and would not support the bill but others would feel differently the fact however is that the majority is so intent i believe unfortunately on an issue that they will not allow even this amendment because i must tell my colleagues that while again this might be to the distress of many an amendment like this would probably change enough votes so that a veto could be overridden if the intention was in fact to minimize this procedure to have it occur only when it was medically necessary indeed the amendment offered by the

why we urge president clinton to veto this thing we would like to get most of the things that are in this tax bill we believe vice president gore is correct when he says we ought to make careful decisions and selections about whose taxes are going to get cut that is what we ought to attempt to do we ought to target those tax cuts but you have to target the tax cuts especially when you are dealing with pensions and health care as much of this does you ought to target it so as to increase the number of people who have pensions all of us here in congress arent going to have any difficulty contributing to get another 5 000 we have plenty of disposable income to come up with the money to be able to increase our contributions the problem is for that minimumwage or slightly over individual in a small business who is struggling to get it done the same on health insurance if you are trying to increase the number of people who have health insurance you have to do more than what is in this tax package my friend from texas senator gramm was talking about the value of the tax deduction the value of the tax deduction is much greater the higher your income i get a 40percent subsidy as a consequence of the level of my income but if my income is 16 000 a year i dont get any deduction if i am paying at the 15percent rate i get a 15percent deduction that is how it works the joint tax committee estimates that 26 million people will get benefits as a consequence of the health care provisions but only 1 6 million of those people are people who currently dont have health insurance republicans in congress i think correctly are saying that what governor bush said in the third debate that is the difference between my opponent and i he wants washington to decide and select who gets a tax cut republicans apparently are saying that the governor is wrong because we are going to select who gets the tax cuts if you are going to have a tax cut right now it seems to me one of the things we ought to try to do is to say this remarkable recovery we are having right now has been fabulous but there are some people who have been left behind lets try to help them acquire pensions in their part of the american dream lets try to help them acquire health insurance in their part of the american dream we dont do that as i said i heard my republican friends assert several times that democrats were on board and support many of the provisions that is true but we added provisions that were stricken out we added provisions that would have made the proposal much more fair i believe you cannot apply a fairness test every single time you are doing things thereare times when life isnt fair but when you are giving tax cuts to american working families it seems to me a test of fairness is appropriate when you are trying to increase the number of people who have pensions in the workforce when you are trying to increase the number of people who have health insurance a test of fairness is appropriate for members of congress to try to apply to the piece of legislation we are considering those are the two objections i have to what is going on right now the first is i think we have lost our way when it comes to fiscal discipline the discipline that enabled us to say to a citizen when a citizen comes and says senator it only costs 100 million over 10 would you offer an amendment and i would always say in the 1990s well i have to have a pay for i have to find an offset not anymore if the paygo provisions of the budget act are repealed as is proposed in this tax bill no longer will that be necessary it used to be i would say look this is going to be tough because it is beyond what we authorized in the budget act and to get 60 votes to waive the budget act is going to be hard not any longer does it appear to be difficult to waive the budget act that discipline that enabled us to get where we are today is at risk in the closing days of the 106th congress i hope that in this election the american people will say loud and clear we recognize the value of that fiscal discipline we benefited from economic growth we benefited from lower mortgage payments we benefited from greater opportunity as a consequence of congress getting its act together all the way through the 1980s and 1990 1993 and in 1997 secondly i have great objection as i look at especially the tax cut proposal but also the bba giveback proposal that we simply havent applied a test of fairness that is why it was a mistake for republicans to have a meeting with only republicans if you want something to be bipartisan you have to let democrats in the room likewise democrats cant hold a meeting and expect it to be bipartisan if we are the only ones in the room and then go out and say gee i dont understand why senator hatch wont sign on board it is something he supported years ago i dont understand why he wont support this it is similar to something he was talking about the answer is he wasnt in the room he didnt have an opportunity to voice his concern he didnt have an opportunity to say what he liked or didnt like what the republicans did is they brought something that stripped out things we had agreed to and they did not apply a test of fairness as a consequence i am pl eased especially connected to the loss of fiscal discipline that in the closing days of the 106th the president has indicated he is going to veto these two pieces of legislation i think the american people will be the beneficiaries of it my hope is on both of them that it will result in bipartisan negotiation and producing something the president can sign it can be done we dont have to run out of here over the weekend we know exactly what to do it would take us about 30 minutes to put together a tax bill and a bba giveback bill that would get 80 votes on this floor we wouldnt have to sit and say i wonder if the president is going to sign it we would know he would sign it if we have 80 votes he is going to sign it the last time i checked that is still enough to override a veto but we didnt do that as a result we are left here on october 27 27 days beyond the time we were supposed to be done and home we are left here still a long way to go before we have an agreement a long way to go before we will be able to say we have closed up shop and we have finished the peoples

places should build reserves for diesel fuel for jet fuel for ethanol for all forms of energy we have the spr this amendment proposes to take 10 million out of spr we cannot just do that arbitrarily it has to be made up some way the money is to operate spr and we cannot cripple it or that reserve will not be available if needed in the period of critical defense needs which is the main objective we had requests to do all kinds of programs similar to this now i would point out that heating oil has a very short shelf life so to maintain a reserve would mean it has to be turned over in a short time something like every 3 months that is a very expensive proposition it means frequent government sales or exchanges it will take a couple million barrels to set up the reserve which will of course create a heating shortfall immediately these things ought to go to the authorizing committee to begin with and hold some hearings i think what we are reflecting here is the fact that we do not have a national energy policy i was here in the 1970s when we had critical shortages everybody said we have got to set up a policy then the shortage went away and there is no policy i think what the gentleman from vermont is addressing is the absence of a national energy strategy i would suggest that he take his case to the administration because we need leadership from them on an overall policy we cannot pick one area of the country it is interesting to note that in the six new england states there is not one refinery because they will not let them build a refinery now it is hard to produce heating oil without a refinery and one of the problems is that their area is impacted by the environmentalists who have made it impossible to build a refinery in new england how many refineries does the gentleman have in new england they are shaking their heads i do not think they have any and they have had some difficulty getting gas pipelines up there too all i am saying is that they ought to have a policy in new england or other parts of the country that need help therefore we need a national energy policy but to try to address one instance is not going to be a longterm solution i

before i ever got here was the idea of working against midnight deals one of the things we talked about the young members of the 104th congress before we ever got here is that we have to stop this the democrats did it for too long and yet here we find ourselves basically getting a 30 billion bill at 11 and we have 2 hours to look at a 30 billion bill that is the antithesis of what we are to be about in process secondly my daddy always used to say dont bid against yourself this is a classic case of bidding against ourselves because normally we say well we are here the senate is over here in terms of spending so therefore we are going to have to appease the senate and we will come up with some number halfway in between but here without the senate ever meeting we have gone and increased legislative branch by 51 million we have increased treasury postal by 1 27 billion and we really are bidding against ourselves so i think this is one of those cases where and i respectfully mean this

come out in the few moments i had to look at this bill for those against gun control why are we increasing atf by 29 4 percent for those that that is an issue of importance for those conservatives against the congressional pay raise why are we including it here again if members want a fig leaf cover in voting against the pay raise then wait and vote against the bill itself but this is a chance to truly defeat it and for those against an increase in members pension here is a chance to get at it the fact of the matter is i have talked to our colleagues on the senate side and they are never
