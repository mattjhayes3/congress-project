million other cases of sexually transmitted diseases occurring each year in the united states if sex education is going to be taught in school it is apparent that the lesson plan should include teaching abstinence this is the practice in my state of california and that is why 180 000 teenagers are learning to resist the message of rap lyrics by choosing education and future success rather than settling for pregnancy and future poverty the doolittle amendment will ensure that all public elementary and secondary school classes on sex education shall continuously stress that abstinence is the only protection that is 100 percent effective against unwanted teenage pregnancy sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immune deficiency syndrome after decades of programs which emphasized contraceptionthe socalled experts can look at their dismal results the percentage of teenagers getting pregnant has nearly doubled in 20 years and illegitimate births have increased more than 400 percent in the last 30 years each year one in nine girls ages 15 to 19 become pregnant we as a nation should not be proud of these numbers we need to make changes we need to find another way the doolittle amendment is clearly a step in the right direction in the last 10 years some schools have been including abstinence in their sex education curriculum and the results have been clearly positive i ask my fellow colleagues if you believe we should reduce the spread of sexual transmitted disease vote in favor of the doolittle amendment if you believe we should reduce the number of

hello mr farmer mr rancher im from washington im here to survey your farm and im here to help you madam chairman i urge my colleagues support of the taylor amendment it is not going to win as the distinguished chairman of the full committee and the distinguished chairman of the environmental subcommittee have pointed out it is not going to win the battle on property rights however it is a very important step in the appropriate direction before we address this issue in other environmental statutes that have a bearing on the environment and one that will assure our constituents that we are really looking out for their rights in each and every possible case now i had hoped that we could approach this amendment and this whole issue not as adversaries but as partners i worked with the distinguished chairman some years ago in working out a compromise in conducting a proper inventory of endangered species and we were concerned with the application of insecticides and fungicides and pesticides and i would hope we could do the same basically what this amendment addresses is this and it is very simple farmers and ranchers have a right to know who is on their land and what type of information is being gathered by a government representative now the gentleman from maryland mr gnkwezsj has indicated in a lengthy colloquy of questions to the author of the amendment that he agrees with the amendment that he has some problems with unique intrusion that on the eastern shore we have a lot of foreign ownership in regard to farm tenants i would suggest to the gentleman from maryland why that might be a unique intrusion simply use the fax and the tenant could fax the requirement to the property owner and we could get it back and sign it because that is a very small portion of the concern that i think we have in regard to property rights in august i went to each of my 66 counties in the big first district of kansas it took me 5 000 miles and 3 weeks and the no 1 concern on peoples minds in the business community and farmers and ranchers was that this business of mandates being passed along by the federal government unfunded mandates that that must stop and a mandate to survey the private property of a farmer rancher which could be a threat to those property values shjald only occur with the express written consent of the property owner that is what this is about why are we upset i have a list of 15 requirements that the farmer already has to go through at the ascs office or scs office the voluntary conservation plan the conservation compliance plan the

they say what on earth do you do passing all these federal regulations and redtap saddling us with more things that have questionable costbenefit ratios and so the very least we can do it seems to me

gag rule permitting just on republican substitute but no separate votes on three critical areas i am therefore urging members to defeat the previous question so that i can offer an amendment to the rule that makes in order just three additional amendments subject to 1hour of debate each first the michelsnowe amendment to strike the btu middle class energy tax and replace it with real spending cuts second an archer amendment to strike the tax increase on seniors social security benefits and third a stenholm substitute amendment for title xvi to provide entitlement caps with a real hammer enforcement mechanism that is all my amendment would do as much as we would like to make in order all of the amendment presented to the rules committee i think it is far better that we keep this previous question vote as simple as possible so that there is no mistake what your vote means to quote from this mornings wall street journal editorial the point is that members shouldnt be able to claim they opposed parts of the tax bill but were helpless to amend it a vote for the closed rule is a vote for the largest tax increase in american history if you told the average constituent in my district that this week we are voting on a reconciliation bill you would probably draw a blank look that is insidethebeltway budgetary jargon but if you tell that same constituent that we are considering the presidents tax billthe largest tax increase in historythere would be a look of instant recognition shock and outrage when the president first unveiled his tax program i thought the president might just get away with the socalled btu tax because it was beyond the comprehension of most of the btu might as well have stood for beyond taxpayer understanding but the public didnt take long to catch on to the btu tax in my district the people know it is going to hit them in the pocketbook at every turnfrom the gas station to the supermarket to state and local taxes to the home today btu is well understood to stand for bleed taxpayers unconscious it is a middle class tax increase plain and simple the same goes for the presidents senior citizen tax increase try as the president may to depict this as a tax on upper income individuals the senlors in my district who make 25 000 a year as individuals or 532 000 a year as couples hardly consider themselves wealthy its another tax on middle clas taxpayers only in this case on those who are retired on fixed incomes the purpose of a reconciliation bill is supposedly to bring our actual spending decisions into line with what we can affordto reconcile our appetites with our incomes the problem is as everyone knows that the government has a voracious appetite that can never be satisfied and so instead of curbing our appetite to match our income we are being asked to increase that income to feed that government appetite for more and more spending and more and more government programs unfortunately the government is not a selfsupporting creature that has any incomeproducing earning capacity it must therefore depend on the incomes of others to satisfy its insatiable appetites and the others it must depend on most heavily are the great mass of middle income workers who are barely getting by now on what they earn yet they are being told by the president that they must sacrifice more for the good of their government it is hard to believe that this is the same president who a few short months ago promised middle class taxpayers a tax out not a tax increase you may recall this little campaign book put out by governor clinton and senator gors entitled putting people first how we can all change america on page 15 of that book there is a paragraph entitled middle class tax fairness in which coauthors clinton and gore promised and i quote we will lower the tax burden on middleclass americans by asking the very wealthy to pay their fair share and it goes on middleclass taxpayers will have a choice between a childrens tax credit or a significant reduction in their income tax rate in the interests of truth in political advertising and labeling i think the president and vice president should publish a revised edition of their campaign book that reconciles their campaign promises with the reality of their record this book should be entitled putting taxes first how we will shortchange america that is just what is happening in this socalled reconciliation bill instead of getting a tax break middle class americans are getting shortchanged well that is not the kind of change my constituents voted for they did not send us here to raise their taxes they sent us here to cut government spending and that is why it is so important for us to change this unfair gag rule and make in order amendments that will do just thattake out the taxes on the middle class and replace them with deeper spending cuts they want us to be able to offer amendments to strike the middleclass energy tax and the middleclass seniors tax and replace them with spending cuts and yet the democrat majority leadership through its wholly owned subsidiary the rules committee has said no to the american people and to these amendments once again they have shut the people out of their own house for the sake of cramming the presidents tax increases down the throats of middleclass taxpayers the time has come for this house to do the right thing and say no to this antidemocratic and antimiddle class rule i urge my colleagues to vote down the previous question so that we can offer a substitute rule that will allow for separate votes to strike the middleclass energy tax and the senior citizens tax and substitute spending cuts for them vote down the previous question and for a rule that will allow us to offer responsible alternatives that will take the tax burden off the backs of the middle class and put the deficit reduction burden back on the congress by mandating spending cuts that is what the american people want us to do this is one of the most critical and important votes you will cast in this session make no mistake about it the people will not be fooled by any attempt to paint this

on rules i would just like to conclude by saying that this republican leadership task force on deliberative democracy in the house is not sour grapes i would like to say if i were speaking to america that the issue is whether or not we are going to take a course take a course of action that is going to lead to 400 billion or 500 billion in new taxes without really substantially reducing the debt and the deficit or are we going to get control of spending in this house and balance the budget and get on with doing what the people of this country want we proposed a 2percent freeze on government spending that would get us to a balanced budget in 7 years the committee on rules would not even allow us to debate that on the floor of the house remember what i said that would have balanced the budget in 7 years without any new taxes and it would have frozen government spending at no more than a 2percent growth and would have cut 848 billion in pork and waste out of government spending that is what the american people want they would not even allow us to debate it on the floor they literally gagged the minority so we could not even debate it because they wanted to ram through president clintons proposals of 402 billion in new taxes and fees 180some billion in new spending the only cuts they were talking about were in the area of defense and over a 5year period instead of balancing the budget or a 7year period we were going to end up with an additional 240some billion a year in deficit as the gentleman from florida so aptly put it instead of the debt and the deficit going down by 1998 we would have a minimum of 6 trillion national debt we believe many of us believe that that national debt by the year 1998 or 2000 is going to be between 8 trillion and 13 trillion if that occurs the interest alone on the national debt will be well above half of all the tax revenues coniing in if that ever occurs we are going to have them printing money to pay off a lot of the debt so we do not have to pay interest on it and we could very well have hyperinflation we could have bread costing 320 a loaf and milk costing 200 a quart because we do not get control of the spending problem around this place that is a direct result of the committee on rules controlled by the democratic majority not allowing us to bring balanced budget amendments to this floor line item veto

american people know the facts as abraham lincoln said then they are going to make the right choices lincoln said let the people know the facts and the country will be saved that is just as true today

cutting benefits you should be fully aware but by extending 20 percent copays to the only two programs in medicare that do not require copayment that is lab tests and home health care we only do that by the way for those above the 150percent level of poverty and by asking highincome beneficiaries over 70 000 a year to pick up a little bit larger share of the subsidized premiums i guarantee you that any serious health care reform package will have copayments in its including the presidents package now let us look a little bit at the presidents package the clinton plan will cut 124 billion out of medicare not 35 billion as in our plan but 20 billion of this are the same cuts that are in the pennykasich plan lab tests and part b premiums both the only thing clinton does not address is home health care all medical care costs wherever they are are fungible that is the savings in one plan can be spent on additional things in another program all up and down the line that is the foundation of the clinton health care reform plan to say that we cannot pull anything out of this is absurd the clinton plan cuts medicare 124 billion medicaid 85 billion raises 90 billion of taxes it

hypocritical and if you believe their numbers after all is said and done they have a cushion of 45 billion built into the total 5year plan that claims deficit reduction of 58 billion so pennykasich does not cut away from any other program or other use of savings it simply identifies part of the savings and proposes deficit reduction and moves them slightly forward in time in the end if the clinton plan is adopted we would still have 58 billion in deficit reduction even with pennykasich pennykasich simply fixes some of it now and moves it forward into the current year to the extent of about 3 billion this my colleagues is the most commonsense serious deficit reduction package i have seen in my 8 years in congress let us not let the country down"], [0.0008562716539017856,

similar situations and congress often must pass emergency disaster assistance bills to pay for crop losses and other damage the federal crop insurance program was designed with the best of intentions but it is not working and we must make some reforms so that the taxpayers do not have to pay for emergency appropriations each time disaster strikes our nation the change made in this bill will improve the delivery and coverage of federal crop insurance programs by offering crop producers premiumfree catastrophic insurance coverage for crops one of the main reasons the current program is

salute him for being the statesman that he is and for moving ahead i also want to congratulate the gentleman from delaware i followed his career as governor and i did not know him very well for his bipartisanship and that of the gentleman from ohio that is what we need there is too much politics in this chamber one of the saddest things that i have experienced over the years i have been here is the lack of comity i have seen in the last 3 or 4 years and the lack of bipartisanship members all know that crime in this country is on fire our cities are shooting galleries with armed thugs and druggies it is time to stop fiddling and it is time to pass a crime bill this crime bill in many respects is much better in my judgment than the one we rejected i worked in conference as thechairman

awful absolutely awful but i swallowed hard and i support it because it is a good bill it is the best we can do look there are a thousand pages to this bill there are over hundreds of provisions if members want to vote against it they can find a provision to vote against it somebody said it is not about interest groups but let us not kid ourselves there are two big interest groups in this country that are involved in this crime bill do the members know who they are they are the nra on the one side and our police and our governors and our mayors and our county officials and our district attorneys on the other side members have a choice today who they are going to stand with are they going to stand with the nra or are they going to stand with those that represent the public interest we have a bipartisan bill there are those that said that we needed a bipartisan bill we worked our will in a bipartisan fashion and we have a bipartisan bill those that want no bill now are the same people that found a reasonin many respects to vote against it last time it is unfortunate there are some that want a bill and that is obvious because they came forward and worked together in a bipartisan fashion everybody that i have heard criticizing the bill criticized the prevention side look i will take a back seat to nobody in this house for being a tough prosecutor i did it for 10 years in the trenches working with youngsters and we axe losing another generation of youngsters because we have not intervened i would say to the members ask any chief of police about crime prevention and he will tell you that is as important as building more jails they are both important we do that in this bill it is a good bill we can save another generation because we are going to do the things we should have done years ago vote for the bill and against the motion to recommit like most everymember i wish that the bill contained some provisions which it does not and i would prefer to drop or modify others overall however the bill offers tremendous potential to truly impact upon the rampant crime which plagues our country and deeply troubles our citizens they want us to be both tough on crime and smart on crime and the bill provides both in a balanced approach of both better enforcement and stronger support for prevention efforts the bill is a good bill overall however as one of the house conferees on the bill i cannot say the same for the process which produced it in the early eighties we set sail on a questionable course of producing farreaching and often inadequately considered comprehensive crime bills every congress in the push to produce this years behemoth particularly in the past few days we seem willing to sacrifice good policy to political expediency if good policy gets in the way of reaching a political solution with the acquiescence if not the encouragement of our leadership a new team of ad hoc conferees was sent in by our republican counterparts some of the changes they suggested or demanded were good some were bad unfortunately policy was not a controlling factor in determining what was accepted and what was rejected in too many instances indeed in the end as the hours wore on policy became meaningless the worst example of such bad policy is the socalled sexual predator provision under a banner proclaiming tough registration requirements for sexual predators we are adding the schumergorton provisions which register almost no sexual predators we were told we had to adopt this proposal because it mirrors a state program which has been highly successful in fact the director of the state program told us that the proposal is a hodgepodge of inconsistent provisions which would cost a fortune to set up and that had it been in effect in his state would have registered only 18 sexual offenders instead of the 7 000 the state currently has registered probably the worst feature of this hodgepodge is that it requires registration of only those sexual offenders who committed their crimes against persons previously unknown to them for example this registration requirement would probably not reach the child molester and murderer who recently murdered 7yearold megan kanka in new jersey since he has lived across the street from megan and might not be considered a stranger within the meaning of the law this is a result of the inexplicably narrow definition of a sexual predator under the schumergorton language fortunately the registration system already in the bill provides for registration and tracking of all sexual offenders so the phony toughness of this proposal does not mean that its flaws allow true sexual predators to escape identification and monitoring it is regretable however that those who want rhetoric at the expense of real registration have joined forces with those who are uneasy about a system which is both tough and effective the result is a registration requirement which is so fundamentally flawed that it is meaningless i also regret that we have rolled back the very narrow provisions in the bill to allow judges to make small adjustments in unduly harsh mandatory minimum sentences the need for such adjustments has been called to our attention by a near unanimous federal judiciary most of them judges appointed by presidents reagan and bush in large part the congressional advocates of allowing some relief for these first time nonviolent defendants who had a minor role in drug crimes calling for inflexible mandatory minimum sentences are members on both sides of the aisle who designed and pushed through these mandatory minimums a decade ago i acknowledge with some regret that i was one of those members it is somewhat ironic that proponents of these adjustments are now being accused of being soft or crime by others who only discovered these issues in the last few weeks or days i chaired the crime subcommittee from 1981 to 1991 theperibd during which these and dozens of other tough crime control laws were passed i am proud of my role in passing those tough laws at the same time i make no claims to infallibility and am willing to make corrections where we went too far or when as in the case of mandatory minimums unintended consequences produce unduly harsh results i am deeply disappointed at the mean spirited reception that these modest relief mechanisms have received i am also seriously concerned about the changes in the rules of evidence that are included within this bill these are the proposed new rules of evidence 413 414 and 415 i do so on several grounds we in the congress many years ago set up an extensive process called the rules enabling act which has served us well for a long time under this particular process changes in the rules of evidence and procedure for federal courts originate not in the congress but in the federal court system in this procedure the governing body of the federal judicial conference of the united states develops and proposes rules changes which must be approved by the supreme court before being submitted to congress the changes go into effect 6 months after submission unless rejected or modified by the congress the federal rules of evidence like all other federal rules affect the daily business of all our courts and also serve as a pattern for many state procedural rules the committees set up by the judicial conference which propose these rule changes are appointed by the chief justice of the supreme court and include federal judges state court justices constitutional scholars and outstanding members of the bar the pervasive and substantial impact of the federal rules demands exacting and meticulous care in drafting amendments this is not evident in the proposal before us the existing rule making process involves a minimum of six levels of scrutiny or stages of formal review this has gone through none of those levels the rule changes in this bill are based on a senate amendment that was offered on the floor of the senate and had maybe 20 minutes of debate it is procedurally and substantively flawed there has been no debate on the potentially enormous impact it would have on civil or criminal cases it is the height of irresponsibility to suggest that we should change our rules of evidence on the basis of no hearings totally abandoning the process we set up and which has served us well these particular new rules would create an exception to rule 404 which excludes admission of a persons character for the purpose of proving action on another occasion substantively the existing rule states that we cannot convict a person for a particular crime based on past conduct of a similar nature in prosecutions of sexual assault or child molestation offenses this type of evidence is particularly inflammatory and thus potentially prejudicial to the fact finding process these proposed new rules would go even further and allow admission of evidence of acts even if the defendant had been acquitted on this evidence in the past any evidence regardless of conviction could be offered under these changes i know that in our actions on crime bills we all have a tendency to try be tough on crime but this is ridiculous frankly what the bill before us would do will raise very serious constitutional questions this is particularly true since in this very conference report we have amended rule 412 of the rules of evidencewhich by the way has been processed pursuant to the rules enabling actwhich would prohibit the admission of evidence of the past history of a victim of a sexual offense the analogous damage which can be caused by an improper inference and could cause unfair harm to a victims testimony in a sexual assault trial prompted the change in rule 412 the change was to ensure that the trial should be fair to the victim and not focus on her past sexual behavior these same concerns should be a factor in considering the changes proposed in rules 413 414 and 415 but are not at the end of my statement i would aik that a letter to chairman brooks from the honorable alicemarie stotler chair of the committee of rules of practice and procedure of the judicial conference in opposition to the proposed rules changes for these reasons be entered into the record frankly the proposed newrules are not only seriously suspect on constitutional grounds but they are extremely bad public policy if the primary evidence in a prosecutions case in chief is evidence of prior actswhich would be possible under the changeswe would be sinking into the star chamber procedures that have long been rejected by civilized societies everywhere this is not a question of whether you are being tough enough on criminals or protecting victims this is a question of protecting our system of justice and fair trials as one of the house conferees on the conference report i would like to explain one change we made in the prison grant portion of the conference report in title ii of the bill the amended conference report deletes language from the original conference report relating to grants for state correctional facilities this amendment removes authority for use of the federal grant funds to fund programs that are outside the normal operational activities of correctional facilities this means for example that an intensive supervision program operated entirely outside a correctional facility and with no custodial element would not be eligible for funding even though intensive supervision is a correctional program the amendment makes no change in the authority to utilize federal funds to operate correctional facilities as a result normal operational activities may receive federal support activities such as drug treatment training and work release remain eligible even though the operational activity may be internally referred to with the correctional facility as a program similarly the amended conference report continues funding eligibility for boot camp facilities and other alternative confinement facilities including operation of such facilities while deleting authority for other alternative programs unrelated to these alternative facilities the amendment is not intended to dictate or circumscribe the components of an operational plan being carried out by a correctional facility whether itbe a conventional facility or a boot camp or other alternative facility the intent is merely to exclude funding for programs which however meritorious they may be are unrelated to the operation of correctional facilities which are eligible for federal funding support it is overall a good conference report it preserves the essential elements of the previous bill tightens the prevention programs in a block grant mechanism and finally provides a strong law enforcement component along with a serious effort to prevent crime i urge you to support the conference report and vote against the motion to recommit"], [0.05378907918930054, 0.5537890791893005, 1, "i thank the gentleman fro yielding this time to me i have been a member of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries since i arrived in congress and have supported many bills to improve the management and protection of our biological resources i support efforts to properly manage and protect wetlands endangered ajid threatened species forest fisheries grass lands prairies and other types of natural habitats however in recent years i have witnessed as a member of the merchant marine committee a trend of increasing federal government control of private property and private resources in the name of environmental protection some of these measures go far beyond what is required to accomplish the laudable goal of biological resource protection as a result many property owners in our country now fear what may occur when our federal government begins counting and cataloging all the plant and animal species that exist on their property and how this information might be used they are concerned that the information might be used to prevent landowners and resource owners from using their own property i want to support a bill to create a national biological survey however if we do not include certain safeguards in the bill there are many of our citizens who are going to be afraid to allow the survey on their property my amendments will provide necessary safeguards that will give those property owners assurance that the survey will conduct its business without violating the civil and constitutional rights of landowners one argument that has been made against my amendments is that they do not belong in this bill but should be addressed in the context of the endangered species debate however the data information and research developed by the survey will not be used just for the purposes of the endangered species act this data will be used for many of our natural resource management programs including wetlands regulation75 percent of which are privately ownedforest management decislonssuch as timber leasingbureau of land management decisionswhich affects grazing and ranchingwildlife refuge management leasing for oil and gas exploration and production fisheries management and other such resource management programs this survey will find itself involved in providing research and data collection to support many types of management decisions and therefore it is important that the survey be given authority and directives broad enough that it can study means by which humans and other biological resources can coexist when we originally adopted the endangered species act we did not provide for consideration of economic impacts in the decisions made under the act as a result we have a law that does not contain the flexibility to provide protections for species while seeking to protect jobs and economic security as we have seen in the pacific northwest and many other areas of the country one of my amendments would simply add language to the national biological survey bill that would require the survey to include research that considers human impacts much of the work of the survey will be done in conjunction with a particular proposed or ongoing management action by the government as i said this could be a wetlands decision a grazing decision a fisheries protection decision or many other types of decisions under my amendment when the survey conducts research to support these management decisions they would also collect information on how these management actions might impact human needs they would also conduct research on alternative management actions that focus on reconciling conflicts and bringing together the goals of protecti ing species and habitat without these major economic dislocations brought on by unwillingness to look at human impacts if this type of requirement is not included within the authorization of this agency they will conduct their research with blinders on unable or unwilling to consider the human impacts of their recommendations and their conclusions because such research is beyond their authorized mission another amendment which i wish to offer would set up a new remedy to compensate landowners when the use of the research conducted by the survey results in the substantial loss of value of their property on two separate occasions secretary of the interior bruce babbitt has stated that the land and water conservation fund should be used to compensate landowners who are deprived of their property due to overreaching government action i quote from mr babbitts testimony on april 1 1993 before the committee on merchant marine and fisheries and in those cases where the economic use of the property has been effectively taken what we ought to do is use the land and water conservation fund to purchase the property on july 15 mr babbitt reiterated that position i agree with mr babbitt for that reason i wish to offer this amendment let me make it clear that my amendment does not define or create a takings statute the amendment does not define a takings and will not set a precedent or affect ongoing litigation over the issue of what is a taking under the fifth amendment it simply sets up a procedure that authorizes the use of the land and water conservation fund where there is a substantial reduction in a propertys value caused by a decision based on nbs data made under the endangered species act or section 404 of the clean water act which regulates wetlands my amendment would allow the secretary some flexibility to offer payment of compensation either in cash or by way of a land exchange our government needs to win back the trust of its people adoption of these amendments will help to bring back that trust"], [0.05444371700286865, 0.5544437170028687, 1, "i would like to at least draw the gentlemans attention to the comments of the distinguished gentleman from new york who serves

process i urge you to support h r 20 we can only have a democracy if we afford those individuals who work in the work force as federal employees to fully participate by being able to not only voice their vote in the voting booth but have the opportunity to also participate in political activities at their homes and at other places across america the purpose of this is not to start any political maneuver with appointees of the government but to give individuals an opportunity to fully exercise their constitutional right i ask the members of this body please support h r 20 because it is in the best interest of america and certainly in the best interests of the american workers at this time speaking of the workers they have a double burden once where we are going to be asking in the very near future these federal employees to pay a tax hike and we also will be asking them to take a freeze in their pay a double burden by the taxpayers on the federal employees of this country i ask you to pass this act because it is in the best interests of the federal employees"]]}
