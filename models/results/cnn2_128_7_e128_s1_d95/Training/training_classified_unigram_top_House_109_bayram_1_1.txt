torture survivors most of whom came to the united states as refugees worldwide it is impossible to count the numbers as wit nesses have repeatedly testified before our committee and before the congress the paralyzing scars from the physical and psychological wounds of torture can remain for years torture impacts not only the individual victim but their families and society as well yesterday the first witnesses testified in the trial of saddam hussein demonstrating heroic courage they described torture on a scale that is almost beyond belief and which is simply too grisly to be repeated here although these events described happened many years ago their testimony painfully illustrates the lasting impact torture has on those who survive it their families and communities there can be no doubt that husseins systematic torture was intended not only to punish specific victims but to coerce an entire population into silence and into subservience as we try to bring democracy to iraq and to other parts around the globe we must try to heal the victims of torture that was used to prevent democracy from taking hold in the past in 1998 congress took a historic step towards repairing the broken lives of torture victims with the passage of the torture victims relief act of 1998 i sponsored that legislation and i was joined by my good friend and colleague who has also been a hero in this battle to help torture victims we also sponsored the torture victims relief reauthorization act of 1999 and the torture victims relief reauthorization act of 2003 as important as these congressional measures have been there continues to be an enormous need for us to reach out to the victims of torture who oftentimes have no other recourse for their suffering therefore i strongly urge my colleagues to join us today in supporting h r 2017 the torture victims relief reauthorization act of 2005 the domestic aspect of this legislation is designed to ensure that particular attention is given to torture victims in regions with significant immigrant and refugee populations the measure authorizes 25 million for fiscal year 2006 and 25 million for fiscal year 2007 to the department of health and human services to assist domestic treatment centers this maintains the current 25 million authorization funding level for fiscal year 2005 for such centers currently 27 programs in 16 states are assisted by the department of health and human services office of refugee resettlement in addition to direct assistance many of these centers are also engaged in training mainstream organizations and personnel in the specialized treatment of torture victims the number of survivors seeking treatment at unitedstates centers funded through the torture victims relief and reauthorization acts has steadily increased throughout the years the client base at just 14 such centers increased from 935 in 1999 to 1 550 in 2000 to 2 579 in 2001 a subsequent survey showed that during 2002 23 torture victim relief actfunded centers treated over 3 600 clients with the additional funding ft is estimated the unitedstates centers would have the capacity and the capability to serve an additional 2 800 survivors per year h r 2017 also authorizes 12 million in 2006 and 13 million in 2007 for foreign treatment centers and programs administered through usaids victims of torture fund this authorization would maintain the current fiscal year 2005 authorization for 2006 and increase it by 1 million for fiscal year 2007 the bill gives particular emphasis to supporting centers and programs abroad in emerging democracies and postconflict environments nongovernmental organizations that receive this funding provide direct services to survivors their families and their communities they also strengthen institutions on the ground and the indigenous capacity of these institutions to deliver services to stqrvivors in addition to providing treatment many of these programs advocate for the elimination of torture itself in these countries lastly the measure maintains current authorization levels of 7 million for fiscal year 2006 for the u n voluntary fund for the victims of torture it would increase this funding to 8 million in fiscal year 2007 in 2001 in just that one year alone the u n fund assisted some 77 000 victims of torture this type of humanitarian assistance provided by organizations which receive grants from the fund consists mainly of psychological medical social legal and economic assistance again i urge my colleagues to support this legislation i attach for printing in change of letters between chairman hyde and chairman barton on the bill h r 2017 the torture victims relief reauthorization act of 2005"],

in her war with iraq now the unitedstates and israel they are already spending hundreds of millions of dollars building a defense system against incoming iranian missiles if irans nuclear and missile programs go further then the united states and israel will have to commit hundreds of millions of more dollars to make sure that our allies in the jewish state are able to resist incoming iranian weapons i will note that a missile fired from iran aimed for example at telaviv would arrive just 11 minutes after lift off putting the middle east on a hair trigger given all of this the united nations reports of violations irans record of terror nuclear and missile developments all reported not by the cia or m16 but by the united nations what should we do some say that we should let iran have nuclear weapons that we cannot stop technology that we should not be able to classify the laws of physics and so iran will get nuclear weapons but if we acquiesce to this then this policy would commit us to a vast and expensive course of building missile defenses to protect our allies while the middle east would descend into a tense hair trigger peace one irrational leader one miscalculation and millions could die in a nuclear jihad it would also put nuclear weapons in the hands of the guardian council the same council that presidents carter and reagan and bush and clinton and bush all certified were the number one supporters of state terror the men and women who funded operations like the gentleman said who would put a suitcase or a car bomb in a western city i think we can do better some might say if this is so bad then let israel remove this threat by military means in fact in 1981 israel destroyed iraqs path to plutonium when it bombed the osiraq reactor but when we look at israel and a potential attack on iran we see a vastly complicated operation of great cost and a chance of failure at best such an operation could set back iran for a few years at worst it would enrage an enemy who would then use all of the means at her disposal to attack the jewish homeland an attack by israel on iran would also destroy what is our greatest longterm asset in iran her young

stepchildren i am taught that charity begins at home america looks weak and reckless when it chooses to secure the borders of other nations feed people of other nations and protect other nations when america is left unprotected unsafe and unsecure mr and mrs william wainscott in dayton texas write vote against amnesty and providing social services which are supported by the taxpayers this has gone too long and too far our government law enforcement officials look the other way while our country is being invaded by people who choose to violate and disregard our system that system being of legal entry and immigration these illegals represent a major burden on taxpayers they not only take away lowpaying jobs they take away good jobs i should know it is extremely difficult for an american citizen to get a job in the construction field because of the number of illegals getting reference in hiring i speak from experience as a welder and a fitter because of preferential hiring practices of construction companies the american has to look elsewhere for his employment tracy blackburn in spring texas writes a los angeles attorney brought into the case last week by the mexican consul generals office in phoenix plans to file another motion claiming maricopa county attorney officials are violating state and federal law because supposedly it is the federal governments job to control illegal immigration well why is the mexican consul general able to use a local lawyer to try toprevent enforcement of american law they are not unitedstates citizens what gives these people these

racism many of my classmates whether they are white black or hispanic feel that the restriction of illegal immigrants is obviously a necessary action further i have received correspondence from richard of houston he says as texans we are on the front lines of this illegal invasion if we fail to act the future of our children the next generation of texans is obviously at risk i urge you to take all possible measures available including support of local border law enforcement agencies with the texas national guard to stop the threat to security and to our economy texans have always stood tall in the face of threats to our state and nation because of the failure of national leadership it is now this generation of texans turn to defend our land i have also received correspondence from patricia in houston she says i am writing to let you know how i feel about the immigration issue we have laws in effect that are not enforced the illegal immigrants are breaking the law they come over here and they do not want to melt into the melting pot of people please vote to shut down our borders and build a wall i will even go down there and volunteer to help build that wall if necessary you might be surprised how many people would volunteer to help build such a wall and how dare people compare themselves to the immigrants that were our ancestors they wanted to be americans they even changed their names to be more american these people are taking texas back one baby at a time and we are just allowing them most americans specifically those on the border states feel that we need to close the border but are afraid of being called a racist it has nothing to do with race it has everything to do with the law finally i received several cases of bricks from an individual down in texas with the cases of bricks that he has sent me this letter i am sending you these bricks in support of an increase in the border security of the united states these bricks should give you a start in

district in the state of texas and as well allow me as a member of the ecumenical community many different faiths to be able to express our sympathy as well it is important to note what many of us believe pope john paul ii stood for an unyielding spine backbone someone who was larger than life who believed in humanity and itssafety and love and as well had the common touch a man who understood suffering having lost his mother at an early age of 8 years old his older brother of scarlet fever just a few years later and his father who was a sergeant in the army in 1941 he understood suffering yet he was the first pope to expand his reach and understand the value of the worlds religious communities coming together and so he paid homage to the victims of the holocaust he was the first pope to visit auschwitz and as well to visit the synagogue of rome in march 2000 pope john paul ii went to the holocaust memorial as well and yes he visited syria pope john paul h was also the first pope to visit a muslim mosque when he traveled to damascus syria later on with the strength of his conscience he said to us war is a defeat for humanity and that wars generally do not resolve the problems for which they are fought and therefore prove ultimately futile so i simply have these words to say simply to thank pope john paul ii for his legacy and his life to appreciate the fact that he was willing to lift those who could not lift themselves and thank him for teaching us about the genocide in sudan and allowing us to lift ourselves to be able to stand against it and to fight with every breath in our body to be able to live his legacy and that is a man of peace and a man who loved humanity i rise today as a cosponsor of the house resolution honoring the life and achievements of his holiness pope john paul ii and expressing profound sorrow on his death truly billions of people around the world both catholic and noncatholic alike mourn the death of pope john paul ii he held one of most influential positions on earth but his life will be remembered as a man of the people a man who never saw any barriers between people i plan to travel with the congressional delegation to pope john pauls funeral at the vatican in rome along with an estimated two million mourners this man has touched the life of so many both with his words and with his actions that people now come together to honor this great man pope john paul was born karol wojtyla on may 18 1920 in wadowice poland his early life was not easy his mother died when he was only eight years old three years later he lost his older brother to scarlet fever his father who was a sergeant in the army died in 1941 by the age of 20 he had lost three of his closest family members but as he would throughout his life he summoned his courage and his remarkable resolve to remain true to his religious upbringing he would grow up in poland during an era of nazi occupation and repression he worked as a common laborer and even as religious expression was being quelled by the nazis he continued his catholic teachings he would become the youngest bishop in modern polish history at the age of 38 as the archbishop of krakow nine years later he was the youngest cardinal guiding the catholic faithful in a country that was officially atheist he was known even then for his stance against communism and the forces of oppression and hate on oct 16 1978 at the age of 58 john paul ii was selected to lead the roman catholic church as the youngest pope of the 20th century his relative youth allowed him to be extremely active and meet with people throughout the world his charisma and grace allowed him to touch the hearts of people and convey a message of peace and collective humanity as pope john paul ii traveled the world to directly speak to the issues that confronted society whereas previous pontiffs often remained distant never straying far from the vatican john paul maintained a busy travel schedule he completed 102 pastoral visits outside of italy and 144 within visiting almost 130 countries during his 26 years as pope he logged more kilometers of travel than all other popes combined his first visit as pope was to his homeland of poland which was still beset by communist rule he advocated for the solidarity movement and he pushed for change but he insisted above all else that any movement in order to be successful must be peaceful it was pope john paul who aptly stated that social justice cannot be attained by violence violence kills what it intends to create his influence and guiding hand brought down the rule of communism in poland and ushered in a new era throughout europe and indeed much of the world i was honored to recently jbave meetings with both former polish president lech walesa and current president aleksander kwasniewski and it seems clear that together with the popes influence poland was able to transform from an oppressive communist country under strict soviet control and with a weak economy to an independent and democratic country with a fast growing freemarket economy the end of communism fell like a series of dominoes in nations throughout the world and truly pope john paul was among the most influential in setting off these series of events pope john paul also used his travel to improve relations between the vatican and people of other faiths he grew up in an area of poland where he lived next to many people of jewish faith during the era of nazi persecution where he saw his jewish neighbors face brutality as pope he wrote and delivered a number of speeches on the subject of the churchs relationship with jews and often paid homage to the victims of the holocaust in many nations he was the first pope to have visited auschwitz concentration camp in poland in 1979 and his visit to the synagogue of rome was the first by a pope in the history of the catholic church in march 2000 pope john paul ii went to the holocaust memorial yad vashem in israel and touched the holiest shrine of the jewish people the western wall in jerusalem promoting christianjewish reconciliation the pope said at that time that jews are our older brothers pope john paul was also the first pope to visit a muslim mosque when he traveled to damascus syria he used his position of influence to bring people of all faiths together and for that we should be grateful at each stop he made as pope he reiterated that we only have one lifetime to live and that we must ensure that we use this time to achieve peace instead of suffering in war it was pope john paul who stated war is a defeat for humanity and that wars generally do not resolve the problems for which they are fought and therefore prove ultimately futile his words certainly ring true for the present as well as the past and future indeed pope john paul ii was a great man for all ages it was he who stated the future starts today not tomorrow his presence and stature will be missed and we are right to mourn this great man however the pope john paul would be the first to tell us that the future is now and we must continue to move forward we must all use his words and the lessons

this bill i think he did a remarkable job and i want to commend him my amendment would simply make a modest adjustment to the bill by restoring funding for two vital rural health programs to their fiscal year 2005 levels specifically my amendment allows for increases to rural outreach grants by 28 511 million and 8 825 million to rural health research this 37 million increase is offset by a reduction to osha as members may know rural programs across the federal budget continue to be proposed for cuts or elimination as cochairman of the congressional rural caucus i feel obligated to rise and share my concern some argue that the medicare bill we passed last year fixed rural health care and that we do not need to continue to fund rural programs but this is comparing apples to oranges the medicare bill increased reimbursements for rural hospitals and doctors while outreach grants that we are dealing with generally do not involve hospitals outreach funds go to a variety of providers that saw no benefit from the medicare prescription drug bill such as public health departnients community health centers rural health clinics mental health providers and other communitybased organizations that provide the finest care to our poorest outreach grants run for 3 years with applicants being eligible for up to 200 000 per year outreach grants emphasize collaboration by key community groups requiring at least three health care providers to come together to apply for the funding the idea of the grants is to provide startup funds to innovative approaches to health problems in rural areas with the appli cants using the 3 years to make the program selfsustaining according to a study by the university of minnesota more than 80 percent of programs established with outreach grants were still operating 5 years after federal funding expired my amendment also restores funding for the 9 million rural health research program this money supports eight rural health research centers around the country and also supports the secretarys national advisory committee on rural health which is composed of national leaders on rural health care and has an important role in shaping administration policy the rural research centers help us understand how cms payments interact with the reality of rural health practice including the wage index issues researched by the university of north carolina and physician payment issues researched in the past by the rural policy research institute in nebraska the rural research line also funds the secretarys national advisory committee on rural health which submits an annual report to the secretary the only ruralspecific report our secretary of health may ever see in a given year this funding line also carries out the function of evaluating federal regulations within the office of rural health policy eliminating this program would effectively cut off the only rural policy shop within hhs if rural health fails there are no winners people travel long distances to more affordable less accessible health care setting in our suburban areas no one wins families are displaced people are long distances from their loved ones and their support team and the system pays considerably more so there is no savings this is the worst possible time to eliminate funding for these programs as the health care world continues to evolve we

member of the house we have 24 25 freshmen on our side of the aisle and over the past 13 months we have grown a little weary with what we see as the amount of misinformation and disinformation that we so oftentimes see brought by the other side so we have developed what we call the official truth squad and so i am here to bring you some messages with some of my colleagues from the official truth squad which is an effort to try to embrace thd american dream to embrace the american vision and to present to the american people and our colleagues the story that congress is working in a positive manner that we are optimistic about the nations future in spite of some things that you hear from some of our friends on the other side of the aisle when i go home and i talk to constituents i oftentimes hear them say what is going on up there why all the negativity why all the pessimism why all the misinformation that we appear to hear all the time and i commiserate with them so this official truth squad is an attempt to try to bring some light to truth to some of the information that we believe the american people ought to have in contrast to some of the things that you have heard even here tonight i am pleased to hear the blue dogs present a proposal or two they talk about being fiscally conservative they talk about being fiscal hawks but my recollection is a little bit to the contrary of that there is a wonderful quote that i like from daniel patrick moynihan a former united states senator from new york democrat and he was such a cogent individual he was one of those individuals who worked for the truth regardless of where it led and he had this wonderful quote he said everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts and i really think that that kind of crystallizes what we have heard in this chamber over the past few minites you have heard the other side talk about deficit spending and how we ought not be spending into the deficit and they are right they are right but when they had an opportunity to decrease spending by nearly 40 billion just a few short weeks ago not a single one of them not one of them voted for it a 39 8 billion decrease in spending and not a single one voted in favor of it you heard them talk about the alternative minimum tax and how it is an unjust tax and it needs to go away and they are right they are right a colleague of mine congressman english has a bill h r 1186 that would repeal the alternative minimum tax not a single democrat on that bill not a single cosponsor from that side of the aisle you hear them talk about the need to balance the budget and not spend so much money and they are right they are absolutely right but when the proposals are put on the table to do away with programs that are wasteful or do away with programs that have significant abuse where are they nowhere to be found so you are entitled to your own opinions but you are not entitled to your own facts and to crystallize that a little more because the disinformation that we heard over and over about budgetary cuts really does a disservice to the debate does a disservice to the discussion does a disservice to the american people because when you look at the numbers when you look at the truth that is not what is going on and this evening you have heard the other side talk about budgetary cuts in the area of defense spending and spend ing on veterans so at home if i were sitting there listening i would say well my goodness they must have addressed the amount of money that was going to the military or decreased the amount of money going to veterans is that not what you would think that is what i would think if i heard that but here we have the defense department appropriation budgetary authority from congress from the year 2000 projected through 2007 in 2000 it was 287 billion in 2001 it was 303 billion that does not sound like a cut to me in 2002 328 billion that is real money that does not sound like a cut to me in 2003 365 billion remember down here in 2000 we were at 287 billion so these are the actual numbers fiscal year 2006 411 billion of budgetary authority for the department of de fense that is not a cut that is responsible spending on the part of the united states congress and i am proud of the support that we have given to our military and i am proud of the support that we continue to give to veterans you have heard this evening that veterans budgets were cut here are the numbers the actual numbers from 1984 through 2005 and i want to draw your attention to what has happened in the last 10 years in 1994 discretionary spending for veterans 17 2 billion 1995 17 6 billion 2005 30 7 billion i do not know what arithmetic they are using i do not know where they went to school but i do know that that is not a cut in anybodys book so when we get this kind of misinformation this kind of disinformation it does not contribute to the public debate it is not honest it is not truthful so the official truth squad is here to try to bring some truth to the situation this is veterans medical care and you heard it talked about this evening how we have these incredible cuts in medical care for veterans here are the numbers 1994 15 6 billibn 2005 29 9 billion that is not a cut it is anappropriate responsible move by congress to take care of those who are protecting our freedoms so remember what mr moynihan said you are welcome to your own opinions but you are not welcome to your own facts so i would like to highlight this evening what is called the politics of division that seems to be practiced by so many here in washington and it is disheartening and it does a disservice to all of us we are going to talk tonight in a positive way about america we are going to talk in a positive way about our future we are going to talk in a positive way about our founding fathers and about our history and about our heritage and jdst to identify the destruction of the politics of division that is so often practiced here i have got a quote from abraham lincoln that i would like to share with you and it is kind of his philosophy on the social fabric he said you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer you cannot encourage the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich you cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn you cannot build character and courage by taking away mans initiative and independence you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could do for themselves the politics of division has no place in the public arena it does a disservice to our nation it does a disservice to the debate frankly it is an embarrassment for the individuals that practice it so i encourage all members of congress republican democrat all of my colleagues to go about our debates and the discussions that we have and the challenges that we face in this nation in a positive and honest and truthful manner then we can get to the right solutions as i mentioned the official truth squad comes almost every evening since we began the first of the year and talks about some positive aspects of america talks about the importance of honesty and truthfulness in the debate and tonight we are going to concentrate on our heritage our american heritage our wonderful american her itage e 2245 i have been joined by a number of colleagues tonight and they are going to share a story or two about maybe the founding fathers some heritage that we have i hope that what
