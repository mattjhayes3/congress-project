research programs and provides for their healthy and responsible growth i would like to compliment the chairman of the energy research and development subcommittee mrs marilyn lloyd and the subcommittees ranking republican member mr sid morrison for the hard work that they have put into this bill i would like to focus my remarks on three very important research programs that are authorized in this bill they are the advanced photon source the integral fast reactor and the superconducting super collider the advanced photon source a large synchrotron radiation machine will be the worlds most powerful source of xray beams and a powerful tool for competitiveness the brilliance and intensity of these beams will permit scientists to study the most intricate details of materials chemicals and biological systems moving pictures of fast chemical and biological reactionseven movies of the living beating human heartwill become possible this research will lead directly to major practical advances in many fields including medicine pharmaceuticals petroleum steel autos coal semiconductors superconductors and chemicals because the competitive benefits of the aps are so clear industry has been more actively involved in the design and planning of the aps than in any other ljoe basic research facility many firms and universities will be putting up their own funds to construct beam lines and hire technical and scientific personnel to operate the facility i am pleased to say that the science committee has recognized the importance of the advanced photon source and has authorized 20 million to accelerate research and construction activities in fiscal year 1989 this would set on the road toward completion of the facility in fiscal year 1994 some 2 years and 26 million ahead of schedule we would also be able to complete the aps within the same timeframe that the europeans and japanese would be completing similar machines thus ensuring that we do not lose our competitive advantage second our competitiveness also requires safe affordable sources of power the integral fast reactor can meet these needs unlike conventional light water reactors the ifr core simply cannot get hot enough to risk a meltdown or release of radiation new metallic uranium fuels pioneered by the ifr program carry heat quickly away from the reactor core the core itself is immersed in a large liquid sodium pool which acts as a huge heat sink that prevents the core from heating up even when all coolant systems are shut off these passive safety systems which do not require any external intervention to be effective have been demonstrated in a series of experiments the ifr is now the centerpiece of the department of energys advanced reactor program and will probably be embodied in future generations of nuclear reactors h r 4505 would authorize 85 5 million for the ifr program in fiscal year 1989 this would permit research to continua at its current levels in addition to providing funds for fuel fabrication for hanfords fast flux test facility and a down payment on the refurbishment of the fuel reprocessing center at the eir11 reactor finally i would like to express my support for the committees recommendations for the superconducting super collider the super collider will be a high tech instrument for exploring the most innermost secrets of matter and nature the funding level provided in this bill would permit the continuation of key research and procurement activities while it may not be everything we sought it is enough to ensure that the program does move forward and that the president will be able to decide whether to proceed with construction or not i believe that this bill represents sound science policy and sound fir policy i

western civilization for 500 years in alliance with poland the lithuanian people contributed to the growth of the ideas and the ideals of western civilization it is a great culture it is an old culture in 1918 as a result of the redrawing of boundaries at the end of the first world war lithuania became an independent country it retained that independence until 1940 when because of the molotovribbentrop pact it was painfully taken away many americans do not realize that the soviets were in partnership with nazi germany in the first invasions of world war ii as we all know through the ensuing world war and eventually onto peacetimefor the rest of the worldlithuania was never again to achieve her rightful independence i think of when it all began on that fateful night of june 14 1941 a night engraved on the memory of im sure many that are here today when soviet troops forced more than 50 000 baltic men women and children kicking and screaming into railroad cattle cars and sent them off to an uncertain fate in far off and inhospitable siberia during the next 10 years as the soviets eliminated more than 000 000 baltic citizens fully 10 percent of the total population of those nations we saw the beginning of the soviets goal to create a lithuania cast in the image of the soviet union critical in achieving this goal was the wipingout of all vestiges of lithuanian independence religion and culture at first as ive already mentioned the soviets used deportations and outright murder to achieve their goal the method later changed to an intense russification campaign churches were closed chriatian education was stifled lithuanians were denied freedom of the press citizens were prohibited from assembling together freely books and papers printed in the west were strictly forbidden in an attempt to break the lithuanian people and ease all vestiges of their culture add to this a huge soviet directed influx of russian emigres and the manipulation of all schools newspapers radio and tv by soviet propagandists and we see the totality of the situation however the lithuanians have vigorously resisted the stifling of their uniqueness and will not crumble to the dominance of the russian majority the nationalization of lithuanian industry the collectivism of its agriculture and the sovietization of its economy have stripped lithuania of its rightful heritage yet the strong voice of lithuanian americansand our last census reported that there are over 800 000 ethnic lithuanians living in the united statesreminds us and encourages us that lithuanian culture will not be trampled under the soviet boot and the lithuanian people are as determined as ever to reestablish an independent lithuania today is an important day because it marks the anniversary of lithuania independence day and throughout lithuania particularly in the cities of vilnius and kaunas the lithuanian people had planned to commemorate their independence to celebrate their independence the lithuanian people intended to take wreaths of flowers and lay them at the feet of monuments to their national heritage their unknown soldiers at churches and at cemeteries the lithuanian people had hoped to in a peaceful not violent way call attention to their rightful heritage an appeal from lithuania signed by 41 clergy and lay leaders in lithuania which reached the west january 30 states in part we appeal to believers worldwide asking them to support us with their fervent prayers that lithuania regain its religious spiritual and national freedom and that it rise from its great moral decline soviet officials had allowed peaceful demonstrations in lithuania latvia and estonia on august 23 1987 the anniversary of the nazisoviet pact which led to the occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union punishing suspected organizers and participants later it was therefore thought there was hope for todays demonstrations however yesterday we learned that 10 000

when the textile apparel industry is making the changes necessary to become competitive madam chairman let me address each of the points i have just made the council of economic advisers estimates that this bill would cost the consumers of america between 25 and 37 billion over 5 years in the form of higher prices particularly hard hit would be the lowincome consumers of america a textile tariff of this nature is a tax and a regressive tax some studies peg the costs as high as 10 billion per year not including the inflation ripple throughout the rest of the economy while sponsors of this bill will try to protect the textile industry how will it affect employment elsewhere the best information i have seen indicates that this bill will result in the loss of some 52 000 retail jobs the consumer costs per job saved is 32 894 next year and at a cost of 41 561 in 1991 the above figures represent the most conservative estimates i have seen of consumer costs per job saved the international business and economic research corp estimates the cost per job at an almost unbelievable 223 000 they also point out that 5 700 more jobs will be lost in the retail sector than would be protected in the manufacturing sector these estimates are static and they cannot fully predict the full cost to america it is no wonder that farmers aerospace employees retail employees and others resist this legislation they know that for every job protected in the textile and apparel industries there will be dozens of jobs put at jeopardy in their industry madam chairman let us look at the beleaguered textile industry and apparel industry that we are hearing so much about since last sessions heated debate on this textile bill i was amazed to learn that 11 textile manufacturers in fortune 500 offered their shareholders a 36 percent total return on investment for the same period apparel manufacturers offered their shareholders 21 percent both are well above the average for all

this legislation would not affect all agencies as many already do not have locational restrictlons my interest in introducing this legislatin came about from my position as the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on public buildings and grounds that subcommittee re lews lease prospectuses submitted by the general services administration for the housing of federal agencies our leasing costs have risen dramatically over the past several years and next year will approach 1 2 billion of course the national capital region is of particular concern due to the high concentration of the federal government in this area last year we paid 375 million to lease roughly 30 million square feet of space in the national capital region alone let me make a few comments as to what h r 2524 would and would not do h r 2524 would simply lift the locational restriction on certain agencies or bureaus which are now required by statute to be located in washington dc and would allow such agencies to be located anywhere in the national capital region in this way all federal agencies or department bureaus would be evaluated on the same basisin effect we are leveling the field to provide for consistent determinations as to the housing and location of federal agencies in the capital area again let me point out that many agencies already do not have such a restrictionsuch as the exportimport bank and the federal deposit insurance corporation the bill also requires that consideration be given to agency needs and mission as well as cost and that federal state and local officials as appropriate are consulted in addition the bill would exempt the principal office of the heads of our major departments such as the department of labor or department of transportation the gsa administrator and the secretary of the department are to determine what components of the department will comprise the principal office no relocation is to take place until 6 months after submission of such report to the congress h p 2524 does not mandate the relocation of any particular agency the intent of this bill is to provide greater flexibility to gsa in negotiating leases and to take advantage of lower leasing costs which may be found in the national capital region outside the district if we do not restrict the location for certain agencies that can function in the national capital region outside the district we would also increase competition by drawing a larger pool of lessors rather than being at the mercy of the big developers downtown as recently as ten years ago leasing costs in the district of columbia northern virginia and maryland were comparable today however suburban rents can be as much as 50 percent lower than rents in the district of columbia rental rates in the district range from 18 to 22 per square foot and fairfax county in virginia where leasing rates may run 20 to 27 per square foot obviously it would not be desirable or feasible to move every agency out of the district and that is not the intent nor would it be the effect of this legislation pach agency should be analyzed on a casebycase basis as to their particular housing needs in a november 24 1987 letter to the public works committee supporting this legislation former gsa administrator terry golden stated gsa is aware that in many instances agencies have legitimate needs requiring a downtown location in other cases however suburban locations are appropriate thus prior to any decision to relocate an agency from washington gsa would carefully consider the mission of that agency and the importance of a continuing federal presence in downtown washington the subcommittee on public building and grounds conducts hearings on each individual lease prospectus submitted by gsa before acting upon any prospectus agencies have appeared before the subcommittee citing this locational restriction in their enabling legislation as one of the primary reasons why they must remain in the district of columbia if this restriction on certain agencies were removed decision could be made on the issues of an agencys operational needs cost and quality of space in fact some agencies have moved to suburban locations and continue to operate effectively the house and senate appropriations committees have also recognized the high leasing costs we are facing in this area appropriations committees reports have included language supportive of relocating agencies to lower cost yet quality suburban locationsagain after considering operational needs let me state that concerns that the federal government would abandon the district with the passage of h r 2524 are unfounded in addition to the fact that the government will undoubtedly continue to lease space in the district of columbia there is currently almost 16 5 million square feet of governmentowned office space in the district of columbiaover 23 million when storage space and special type space is included in addition this congress has passed a public works bill providing for nearly 1 5 million square feet of federal space at the international cultural and trade center on the federal triangle later today we will consider a bill for a 520 000 square foot judiciar office building next to union statics h r 2524 recognizes that the landscape national capital region has changed considerably since many of these restrictions were enacted the location of the seat of government in washington has spurred development in the metropolitan area and blurred the borders we must make every attempt to lower the federal governments 1 2

nicaraguan society we know lae resistance has succeeded in pressuring the sandinistas to make some movement toward fillfilling their commitment to democratize but continued pressure is neces sary the

resistance has organized efforts to educate its fighters and punish offenders the sandinistas on the other hand have shown a systemized pattern of abuse and torture lino hernandez executive director of the nicaraguan permanent commission on human rights personally told me that the commission received 18 complaints against the contras in 1986 and 1 400 against the sandinistas the sandinistas have made limited reforms that can be easily reversed if they succeed in influencing this congress to vote against helping the democratic resistance these reforms have only been made in the face of increased effectiveness of the resistance and with the aim of defeating continted unitedstates aid without the continued pressure of the resistance the sandinistas will be free to continue its

era and on the family of battlers and warriors for humanity in this country for the oppressed for the minorities for the poor who gave no inch who would give no quarter in seeing that public policy reflected the concern for those who truly needed the help of this government sala burton was more than that however she was a wonderful and dear friend constantly asking after my children and my wife what were we going to do for the easter break and where were we going to spend christmas and how were the children doing in school because she was always concerned about how members of congress would survive our daily chores in the career that we had chosen i think she started that clearly as the wife to phillip where many of us always thought that perhaps san francisco had an extra representative because she battled on those fights as strongly as he did but i want to express my very personal grief and sorrow for her passing to her family and to her brotherinlaw john another of the great burtons who fought so hard for the issues that are so important that we debate in this congress we are really going to miss sala burton because she put a little extra glimmer in this body as she talked to all of us not just about the issues but about our personal wellbeing and constantly constantly tried to make sure that we could be in the best state of mind to perform our tasks here our state and northern california and clearly the city of san francisco have suffered a great loss with the passing of sala burton"], [0.10461664199829102, 0.604616641998291, 1, "i rise in strong support of the highway and transit bill before us the committee believes it is imperative to pass h r 2 without amendments for the following reasons many states and cities are running out of highway and transit funds and are delaying or canceling projects they and the construction industry are extremely concerned that they may lose this entire construction season if highway transit legislation is not enacted shortly this is certainly true in illinois the committee believes that this is the best way to enact legislation quickly save the 1987 construction season which is fast upon us and save as many as 700 000 jobs which hang in the balance20 000 jobs in illinois alone the strategy of the committee has been to take essentially the same bill that passed the house last timeby a 10to1 marginback to conference with the senate in that way we hope we can resume the negotiations of the last congress and quickly resolve our differences by building on the progress that has already been made although there were requests for substantive changes by some members before introduction the committee leadership determined that reopening the bill would jeopardize quick passage and the 1987 construction season if the bill is opened to amendments on the floor it would seem necessary that the legislation be taken back through the committee process so that an orderly development of a new bill can be pursued unfortunately such procedures would seriously delay passage of the bill in closing i commend my distinguished chairman the gentleman from new jersey and the distinguished minority member the gentleman from arkansas the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from california and the gentleman from pennsylvania for the outstanding work on this bill"], [0.13631480932235718,

today tomorrow onthis measure i think it is very important and timely that finally we put in place some tough tough trade laws that will make a difference in our trade deficit the 170 billion trade deficit translates to over 5 million jobs around the world and not in america it is time we take action i am proud that both the banking committee and the government operations committee on which i

benefits in both daycare and medicaid we should note that there is not any guarantee that one penny of daycare will go to families in need under the republican substitute and no 2 that the transition benefits under medicaid are no different under the republican substitute than they are today let me go from there to say that almost everyone who comes to congress takes a look at this body and suggests tlt at one time or another that things really do not change much around here if we look at this piece of legislation today we have to conclude that there are times when things can change when things do change when things will change every politician that has run for office i am willing to bet at one time or another has stood up in a town meeting and said do you know what i support i support reforming that welfare program of ours because the program does not work it institutionalizes welfare we have generations of welfare recipients and if i get down there to washington dc i intend to do something about it to change it it is going to be tough for some people here in congress to be confronted with actual change this bill is structural reform real change in our welfare program what we are saying is yes we want to take people from the welfare rolls and put them on the payrolls yes we want that to happen and we believe that most welfare recipients want that to happen my colleagues have heard the numbers that twothirds of the welfare recipients in this country are kids under the age of 16 clearly america is not going to send them to the work rolls but there are a lot of welfare recipients who are trapped in a cycle of poverty from which they cannot escape and they do want a chance to get a good job make a decent living have an opportunity for themselves how does that happen it happens if we have the guts to decide that we will put together a welfarereform package that offers them education training and work that is exactly what we have done we have folks here in congress who say we love this first part of the notion that we want to force people from welfare to jobs we love that but when it comes to the second part the education and training to get to that payroll we are not so sure we like all of that because that is going to cost some money there is some experience to guide us in what it costs because several states have done this before massachusetts has a new and novel program let me tell my colleague what massachusetts tells us massachusetts with a proposal similar to this current welfarereform package has an annual cost of 80 million and introduces an annual savings of 100 million that means what we invest if massachusetts is any guide at all if there is any experience here to learn from what we invest we are going to get back plus 25 percent that is a darn good investment so i say to those in the house who have always campaigned on welfare reform now is your chance this is structural reform this is real reform do you believe people ought to go from the welfare rolls to the payrolls do you believe people ought to have a chance to go from the welfare rolls to the payrolls if yes then vote for the welfarereform bill would you like the federal government to save money if you say yes then i say vote for this welfarereform bill would you like to keep families together would you like to help these welfare recipients who really desperately want to work and want to get off of the welfare rolls if you say yes to that then vote for this welfare reform bill but do not tell us that you want change that you want reform that you want real structural change in our welfare program and then find 100 different excuses and 100 different reasons to oppose it when it finally gets here there was an old man who was interviewed by a radio announcer and the radio announcer said how old are you and the old man said 80 years old the radio announcer said you must have seen a lot of changes in your lifetime and the old man replied yep i have and i have been against every one of them too there are a lot of folks in congress like that they talk about change they talk about change but then they are against it when they are confronted with change this bill i am proud to support this is real structural reform of the welfare system that is good for this country welfare in our country has become a patched and potholed street that leads to a dead end we add a program here and change a program there but its still the same system with no exit its a dead end for the taxpayers who invest billions of dollars in a program that doesnt work and its a dead end for hundreds of thousands of families who want to get off welfare but have no escape the system has failed instead of serving as a temporary stopping off point for ablebodied people on their way to a jobwelfare has become an institution that stays with families for two and three generations i believe that people want the independence and dignity that a decent job provides and the taxpayers of this country want to see results from the multibilliondollar investment they make each year in welfare programs the system weve got now cannot achieve these goals because its designed to provide poor families with just enough money to stay at home pay the rent and buy groceries its time to make a change and create a welfare system that prepares people for work instead of lifelong dependence on the government weve got the tools to make these changes with h r 1720 the welfare reform act first of alland most importantwelfare reform takes stock of just who is a typical welfare family and what the family needs to leave the welfare rolls over twothirds of all people on welfare are children under the age of 16 the remainder are primarily women who are the mothers of these children the women are young very often teenagers undereducated untrained and unable to find a job welfare assures that without any other means of support these women and children in poverty at least have shelter food and clothing in my state of north dakota a typical welfare family is a single woman and her young children they receive a welfare payment each month of 340 for the entire family lets face it no one is getting rich on welfare its obvious that any parent trying to support a family on 340 a month would rather have a job but on 340 a month parents cannot h 1145 6 enroll in vocational training cannot pay a baby sitter and cannot support the children while they look for a job the result a typical welfare family goes nowhere and welfare becomes hereditary h r 1720 replaces the old system with a common sense progam that devotes 65 percent of its resources to education training and job preparation since those who have the hardest time breaking the welfare cycle are women with children h r 1720 provides child care assistance while unemployed parents receive education and training after parents complete their training this bill provides continued child care help for 6 months and health care assistance for up to 24 months to assure the children are provided for while their parents search for jobs and enter the work force this legislation also helps welfare families get hold of their lives in one other very important way most children on welfare live in one parent families the absent parent doesnt support them thats just plain wrong while this bill helps single parents get the education they need to learn a wage it also puts into place a program to help the states find absent parents and require them to pay their child support h r 1720 will cost 1 5 billion over the next 3 years but it can save us billions of dollars down the road if parents support their children welfare costs go down its that simple several states are already experimenting with welfare reform programs that make a strong investment up front for gains later on and while the verdict is not yet in from most of the states that are adopting welfare reform programs some states are already realizing gains in massachusetts where welfare reform took hold several years ago an annual cost of 80 million has produced annual savings of 100 million 40 000 welfare recipients have been placed in fulltime jobs in arkansas a rural state like north dakota a 3 million investment has their welfare reform program breaking even after its first year they expect to save dollars in 3 years time in new jersey a 3year old program has already reduced case loads for social workers and is breaking even if nationwide we could adopt an aggressive program of education and training for welfare families and remove just 3 percent of those families from welfare we could save 400 million a year i believe that over the long term well save billions in federal tax dollars lets take a detour from the dead end road of institutional welfare we can pass h r 1720 and make welfare a temporary step on the way to job independence and better future for thousands and thousands of poor families its a road worth exploring"], [0.15151762962341309, 0.6515176296234131, 1, "i want to agree wholeheartedly with the comments of the gentleman from california i voted for grammrudman

saved this house a lot of money i think the special orders have been tighter they have been more bipartisan and we have not seen the accusations being made against members that is really what we wanted to do it is very costly if we run the cameras all night long and let everybody pretend like they have a forum if they know they are going to be panned then people put more time and purpose in them and they certainly can go forward with them i think the gentleman from california makes a good point if the gentleman would like to bring this to the leadership and say lets do this on tributes i think most of us would be in agreement but i think changing it radically and hiding it behind tributes is a real way to open the treasury i think there has been a great difference in the cost of running these cameras before and after the speakers very fiscally conservative move so i thank the gentleman from california for pointing that out i think we really ought to be very clear about what

actually occurred the dislocation was frightful it was almost impossible to describe the complete chaos and havoc that was wreaked upon the people involved when a major corporation such as united states steel does not give advance notice of a plant closing now we were fortunate in our area because united states steel at the time did give some notice it gave the notification but it was not on the basis and under the auspices of the legislation we are talking about it was helterskelter give or take it some was given properly and some was not i can tell you that in those areas where for
