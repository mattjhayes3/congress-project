destroying the very fabric of this country people in my district no longer can buy homes small business does not have the ability to go out and borrow capital in order to grow individuals are hurt as they are pushed down on the economic ladder instead of having the opportunity to climb up no i think thle american people spoke in november of this last year when they selected president reagan to try to do something with the problems we face as a nation if forno other reason i support this program because of that the president has the overwhclming maildate of the people he has presented a threepoint wvellthoughtout program and i think that we should give him an opportunity to see what hie can do obviously no one can agree with all the particulars but in rny opinion we have a unique opportunity and we should rise to it thle price wve have to pay for continuing on as is is too great astronomical taxes unemployment newly built houses sitting empty doubledigit interest rates inflation the list goes on and on we must turn thle economy around and do something different we are a compassionate nation and it seems to me that the height of our compassion wvill be demonstrated

armed h 1766 c forces to thle point wvhere many military experts believe we are functionally behind the unitedstatess r in military readiness even if we move quickly now to rebuild we will have 4 to 5 years before the increased spending produces substantially increased defense capabilities will the soviets wait and if we do not move now can we rely upon the soviets not to press theii advantage how

deterrencepersuading another that action against us k ill bring him more harm than gain thle jones budget recommends a defense budget that is 7 1 billion in budget authority and 4 4 billion in outlays

lived to be 5 weeks of age his grieving father wrote it seems like this world has no justice anymore they just dont punish the crim inal anymore this accident happened more than 9 months ago but the man who killed jason is still driving a car even though he was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants and driving on the wrong side of the highway and also charged with homicide by a vehicle while both my constitutent and his wife required medical treatment for 6 months the man who could not resist the urge to have just one more who had also been

roads daily drunk driving is the most frequently committed violent crime in the united states today taking the lives of 70 people each day and injuring thousands more most heartbreaking is the loss of innocent young lifeand i immediately think of the tragic loss to that young family of their 5weekold son or of the young man who witnessed the accident which took the life of his 20yearold fiance just 1 week before they were to have been marriedyoung life senselessly snatched away because someone could not resist having one for the road last year i cosponsored legislation sponsored by

as from the nations news media and among the american public generally also i cosigned a letter asking president reagan to establish a presidential commission on drunk driving the creation of which he announced on april 14 1982 however the problems associated with the drunk driving epidemic remain with us drunk driving is the most frequently committed violent crime in the united states today last year alone another 25 000 persons were killed in alcoholrelated crashes more than 650 000 suffered injuries and drunk driving created economic costs surpassing 24 billion while 70 of our citizens are

in which the seed laboratories workload could be assigned elsewhere within the usda the animal and plant health inspection service of remarks august 18 1982 received responsibility for noxious weed testing a function it could efficiently assume with existing personnel at ports of entry the department found and assured us that the awarding of certificates for the export of unitedstates seed could be delegated to the states to be supported with user fees without any changes in statute the remaining function of the laboratoriesknown as pure live seed random samplinghad to be performed at beltsville we were told subsequently the aphis was assigned live random sampling in its laboratory at new brunswick n j the department of agriculture has assured sus that these consolidations and changes will be carried out with absolutely no loss in time or efficiency however its good intentions aside the department will not be able to eliminate entirely the prospect that the requirement for pure live sampling will not result in costly coasttocoast shipment delays it happens also that pure live seed random sampling does not even appear to be necessary at least in the minds of the ltsda and the seed industry each state has its own seed standards and in most cases they are higher than the federal standards in no case are they lower additionally for its own marketing purposes the industry must generally provide quality and germination assurances that exceed even the highest of the state standards the federal requirements set forth in the 1939 seed act are obsolete and redundant the possible problem of shipping great distances combined with the lack of purpose for the federal pure live sampling requirement lead us to conclude that it would be best to simply eliminate the requirement from the statute prior to october 1 if possible that is this bills primary purpose as far as i am concerned in addition however it contains some other provisions to eliminate conflicts between federal and state seed laws and to provide flexibility to the secretary of agriculture in administering the act the act specifies that certain grasses be classified as fine textured or coarse kinds and a list of the two categories is provided in the regulations the development of new improved varieties of grass seed has blurred the distinction between the two lists it has come to a point where it is impossible from a legal standpoint to differentiate between the two kinds it is a very slow and difficult process to change the lists in the regulations as new varieties are developed and even more difficult to classify a new variety of grass into one of the categories the association of american seed control officials made up of state representatives has recommended elimination of the requirement to label according to these distinctions and has made the change in the reci august 18 1982 congr ommended uniform state seed laws several states have adopted this labeling change in their seed laws others are only waiting for the federal seed act to be changed in order to change their laws in an attempt to conform to two different sets of laws a seedsman selling seeds in one of these states could be in violation of either the state or federal law or both a member of the seed industry selling seeds on a national level finds it difficult if not impossible as well as expensive to attempt to label his seeds in a different manner in the 50 states the second immediate need for changes in the fsa pertaining to lawn seed mixtures is to corrept the labeling requirement to allow that only the month and year of the oldest germination test be required since the test must be completed within a 5month period of the date of sale listing only the oldest germination test date would automatically cover those varieties within the mixture which had been tested at a later date there is a great deal of information required on a small package of seed and since this is a control measure and does not afford the consumer additional protection it would save time and money in printing the label and make it easier for the consumer to understand the information that is helpful there is also a need to provide the secretary of agriculture with authority to extend the 5month period between the test date and date of sale when he finds that under ordinary conditions of handling certain kinds of seed will maintain its germination qualities over a longer period of time it may seem late in the year to be introducing a bill however one os my

or unauthorized programs or agencies this substitute rule only makes one minimal change at the end of the rule i which was read it makes in order two amendments printed in yesterdays record and waives all points of order against those amendments the purpose of this substitute is therefore the same as the purpose of the original rule to waive points of order against certain legislative provisions i do not think it will do any good to claim that this rule is nongermane because one of the amendments goes to the jurisdiction of another committee since all of the legislative provisions go to the
