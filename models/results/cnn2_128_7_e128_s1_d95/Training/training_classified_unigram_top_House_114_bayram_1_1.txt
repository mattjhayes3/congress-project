ensure a safe consumer financial marketplace by facilitating the licensing of certain financial services providers congress authorized the creation of the national mortgage licensing system and

increasing efficiencies for industry and enhanced consumer protection currently the greater utility nmls is frustrated by the fbis current statutory incapacity to enhance the platform by allowing additional financial service providers other than mortgage loan originators to be licensed under this system when processing licenses authorized state regulating agencies should have access to the most uptodate criminal background information from the federal bureau of investigation for certain classes of financial providers that is not occurring the fbi should not be hindered from bringing the same efficiency to the criminal background checks of financial services personnel that the nmls brought to the mortgage loan originators by enabling the state license agencies to obtain these background checks this bill will make the licensing process more efficient and potentially help qualified businesses get up and running more quickly by enhancing the authority to process criminal history records for licensing of financial service providers beyond mortgage loan originators this bill ensures that state financial regulators have the necessary tools to exercise effective oversight i want to be clear that this bill only affects financial services businesses which are already required to conduct background checks and which cannot currently use the nmls system by federal law h r

federal surface transportation programs through november 20 2015 this bill allows states to continue to fund transportation projects and it prevents 4 100 unitedstates department of transportation employees from being furloughed h r 3819 funds these programs at the authorized levels for fiscal year 2014 no offsets or transfers of funding to the highway trust fund are necessary for this extension since the trust fund will remain solvent during this period last week the committee on transportation and infrastructure unanimously approved a bipartisan multiyear surface transportation reauthorization bill this extension will enable the house to continue its work on this important legislation h r 3819 also includes critical language extending the deadline for railroads to implement positive train control technology to 2018 we have known for some time that railroads simply cannot meet the congressionally mandated positive train control or ptc deadline of december 31 2015 what has become more apparent is how catastrophic it would be for the nations economy if we dont extend the deadline now without an extension railroads will stop shipping important chemicals critical to manufacturing agriculture clean drinking water and other industrial activities in fact some railroads are already notifying shippers they will stop accepting chemical shipments by december 1 this is creating extreme uncertainty across a variety of groups that rely on rail shipments from farmers who need ammonia for fertilizer to water utilities that need chlorine to purify drinking water some industrial companies have already begun the planning process for shutting down plants because they cannot operate without chemicals delivered by rail we have heard from one chemical company in new hampshire that said its railroad will stop picking up chlorine on november 13 this company is the only supplier of chlorine to the entire sixstate new england region for drinking water and wastewater treatment therefore after november 13 new england could very well be without chlorine to clean its water on a broader scale a ptcrelated rail shutdown would pull 30 billion out of the economy in one quarter alone and lead to 700 000 jobs lost in just one month it is our responsibility to extend this deadline now and avoid such harm to the nations economy this language is based on bipartisan bicameral work over the last several weeks and it would ensure that railroads implement positive train control as quickly as possible i urge all of my colleagues to support h r 3819 i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.002477109432220459, 0.5024771094322205, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume it has been really an interesting morning discussing what we could do what we not do and what we have done and actually the fact and the process of the house doing its job again and the senate democrats not doing theirs it is just very frustrating you talk about the american people i tell you from a republican standpoint this is about administration this is about a time in which we are confronting in which there is honest debate on both sides but when it comes down to the bottom line it has been very true over the course of these first 7 8 weeks here that one party is putting forward an agenda that says that moms and dads and kids matter that the rule of law matters that things are to operate in a certain way and they are operating in the way that we grew up knowing civics from our founders that had a constitution that laid out the path what is interesting right now is that really right now the house republicans for the second time are providing a path to keep the department of homeland security open for business while the judge federal judge has said the administration cannot go forward on their executive amnesty memo which means it is not happening right now so the question really becomesand i dont think this can be stated enough because when people are out there looking to washington they are wanting to know are you thinking about me are you thinking about what is going on are you thinking about what we need to fund in the days that people get up and they know that their country is fighting for them so i just want to make it very clear we said for the second time this is the second time because the first time happened on january 14 the house approved a fullyear funding package for dhs and yes said this is what we do not like and will not fund but this is a part of the process then february 3 senate democrats vote to block consideration february 4 senate democrats again vote to block consideration february 5 guess what senate democrats vote for a third time to block consideration february 23 lets at least make it a home run we will touch all the bases senate democrats refuse for the fourth time to block consideration but then the most amazing part democrats even prevented themselves from offering amendments to strip language they found offensive we are here today because the senate democrats refused to be part of the solution so as i go forward and as i look at this there has to be an understanding of this todayand it was said earlier and i made the point but i am going to make it one more time todaya solution is being put forward there is no one putting forward a bill to shut anything down the bill that is being put forward is to fund for 3 more weeks so i will encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle any democrat who wants to vote no on this funding bill you are voting to shut down the department of homeland security is that what you want to tell the american people with that i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill the material previously referred to by ms slaughter is as follows"]]}
