on a regular basis with repard to the compesinos which make up the ranks of the freedom fighters the contras as i was listening to him depicting them as cowardly lazy ruthless i thought back to my own days during vietnam when our people or my colleagues in vietnam were depicted in the same way by american liberals they were baby killers they were ruthless they did not have the wellbeing of the people of vietnam at heart we know that is an absolute untruth what mr trafcant has stated it is as untrue as the denigration of american fighting men and women in vietnam it was that denigration i think that made coming back into this society so difficult for so many of our people not what others said about us and them but what liberals in the unitedstates congress and other places said about them let me just say a few things about the compesinos who were the contras the freedom fighters it is now admitted by both sides that this is not a bunch of national guardsmen these are 17 and 18year d kids if they were samozas national guardsmen they were national guardsmen when they were 8 years old most of them fight the sandinistas heavily armed by the soviets without pay so they put rucksacks on their back and they travel 100 miles into the country to get into the fighting area without pay to face soviet gunships and to face a military machine that is armed with more dollars by mr qadhafi alone than the united states congress made in its entire set of payments to the freedom fighters on our side to the soviet military machine that has put 2 billion into this conflict mr traficant says why do ohioans care we dont care weve got jobs i have news for you sixty percent of the traffic that goes through the panama canal a few hundred miles away from nicaragua carries goods that are made in america or bound for america in trade many of the goods made by his steel workers and manufacturers in ohio go through the canal at punta huete in nicaragua the soviet union and the cubans are building mig revetments for mig fighters that put them within striking distance of the panama canal through which 65 percent of the traffic that travels is american traffic and traffic that comes from the gentleman from ohios district in many cases so we have a direct interest and that leads me to the final point we are leaving this set of blunders and this lack of will by the liberals in the unitedstates congress with several things happening the contras are headed for slow extinction we know that mr arias is leaving with his peace prize we know that the united states is leaving the scene with soviet military presence firmly established in nicaragua and for the first time there is a naval base on the pacific side of our hemisphere at corinto another naval base at el bluff for the soviet union on the atlantic side and a bomber base and a mig base at punta huete about 100 miles north of managua that is our reward for giving in to the sandinistas"], [0.015187757089734077,

significant problem im sure everyone remembers the garbage and medical waste washups and the closings imposed on many beaches during the last two summers particularly in new jersey and long island these closings placed severe economic hardships on the beach communities and ruined many summer vacations to help us cope with the medical waste crisis i have cosponsored several pieces of legislation that address different aspects of the problem h r 3515 is potentially the most useful because it directs the epa to develop a way to track medical waste from its point of generation to point of incineration or disposal in addition this bill directs epa to submit reports to congress describing what the agency knows about the generation handling treatment storage and disposal of medical waste i am sure this information will prove to be invaluable to us when we try to fashion an appropriate national regulatory response last month during hearings at jones beach long island i got the impression that small clinics and small hospitals and other medical people were stashing their waste in glad bags rather than socalled red bags because of the high expense involved in properly disposing red bag or hospital waste with this legislation it will be less likely that this improper and haphazard method of waste dist 9513 posal will continue in addition to developing useful information this bill should also provide immediate relief to those states that decide to join in the tracking demonstration program by helping epa and the states identify and hold accountable those businesses and people involved with the improper disposal of medical waste there is no question that this country has a serious solid waste disposal problem major media stories such as the wandering garbage barge and beach closings constantly remind us that the problem is getting worsenot better weve got a long way to go in handling the garbage crisis the tracking program set up in h r 3515 will help us develop information to understand the magnitude and characteristics of our medical waste stream that information will give us direction to go forward and improve the nations management of medical waste these steps and many more are required to ensure that we wont experience more garbage minidramas on the evening news i urge my house colleagues to support this legislation in closing i

have allowed la prensa to operl the catholic radio station can operate they are preparing to declare a unilateral ceasefire the question about all of this isk what does itall mean is it a legitimate and sincere beginning to a proeess of democratization or is it yet another tactical ploy by marxistlennists the history of marxistleninist regimes leaves na alternative to serious analysts than to say we view these moves with scepticism with caution with prudencebut also with a tiny bitof hope but hope doesnt make freedom happen rea substantive progress in the real world makes freedom happen we cannot be satisfied with the forms of democratization we must demand the substance and i rr this case the substance of democratization in nicaragu demands that the sandinistas know they still have the democratic resistance to worry about without the democratic resistance the sandinistas would never have come to the bargaining table the democratic resistance and itsability to remain a f orce in this peace process in my judgment is absolutely vital and that is why aid in the cr fs vital not lust for the contrasbut for the last fragile hope of justice freedom and peace in nicaragua consider the following the new nicaraguan constitution written by a sandinistasdominated constituent national assembly specifically mentions the sandinista popular army the armed forces totally under the ideological and political control of theruling sandinistas party how can there be true popular pru ralism in a state in which there is a constitutional provision about an army dominated by one specific political party f am glad to note that the washington post yesterday or the day beforefor the first time that t can recall mentioned that specifically in a na tionally recognized editorial comment of a dominant newspaper ir this coun try and the media have not focused enough attention on that specific subfect can we realistically hope the sandtnistal popular army will lose its ideological character in the brave new world of the agreement is there anyone in this chamber who believs the sandinista party is going to allow the army to be con trolled by another party or to be at the service of the nation regardless of who is elected no other country in central america has an army of this character it is the military arm of the vanguard marxistleninist party it is this ugly little fact that destroys the beautiful theory some might ha e about the sandinis tas good faith the fate of freedom in central america and in nicaragua especially is at a crisis point if we in the congress allow ourselves to be deluded and deceived by the recent moves of the sandinistas 1 think we will regret it as long as we live the aid we provide to the democratie resistance in the cr is not going to change the balance of forces by any stretch of the imagination it is not going to threaten the sandinistas what it will do is to put tba united states of america on record of not abandoning an ally just because cer tai forms of democratization have been temporarily agreed to by a marxistleninist government if we withdraw our hand by refusing these fund it wil be a slap heard round the

colleague for yielding to me in order that i might join him and my other colleagues in discussing this very important issue of education and a new direction on agriculture first let me say that i think probably the first step we should take is to have people understand what agriculture is and what it is that we do i think we begin by taking the fact that agriculture and everything in agriculture is the largest consumer group in the united states of america and perhaps in the world and when we think of the jobs related to agriculture perhaps 20 percent of all the jobs in the united states in one area or another are related to agriculture but the different times and the changes in our society and the direction in which we are going demand that we do more i want to commend for example the 4h and the fpa the future farmers of america we have very close contacts with this group and that is a nicleus of outstanding young men and woman in the united states of america who have done a tremendous amount of good work recently we had group here working with what they call boac building our american communities the youngsters have projects that they work on perhaps one of the exemplary projects i might mention at this time is to identify the direction we should be going because some people ask is there a future in american agriculture well a couple of years ago one of the projects taken on by the youngsters in a small town in oregon was a reforestation project and when i asked the young man who was the sponsor of the project in that faa chapter when will you harvest the seedlings that you are now planting he said oh i dent know 50 60 70 years from now this exemplifies that chapter aid the thinking of that young man because perhaps ffa and thnt young man were thinking way way ahead in the future and had confidence in the future but what we speak of here is a multiplicity of things the schools need to have agriculture as part of the curriculum not just something off in the back room or in the back of the school yard where you have vocational education or a little meeting room for the ffa or the 4h it should be a part of the basic standard curriculum secondly beginning with adults we know it is said that there are people out there who think that milk comes out of a carton that peas come out of a can and that we just go to a supermarket and ring a little bell and then they bring us whatever cut of meat we would like chicken or pork or lamb there are people in our enlightened society like that now so where do we begin to correct this misconception or inaccuracy or failure in the cultural development of our populace we begin in theischool and we begin with the youngsters we ask what are the nutritious foods that we should eat how do we differentiate a cow from a deer a few years back one of my secretaries brought one of our youngsters that i had taken to texas to visit with me so he could see a few things i had a mounted deer head in my office and he looked at it and he said cow that is what his understanding was of anything with horns this is the minimal of what we can do i commend the gentleman for taking this time and for reminding us of the research councils board report understanding agriculture a new direction of america this is where we need to go we need to start with your youngsters in urban and rural neighborhoods everywhere a youngster is so he knows for his own good and benefit something about agriculture so he would know what is the proper nutritional value of the things we eat and then so he would be able to communicate with his peers in the community then that develops to the rest of the community and perhaps to the rest of the nation so that we do not lose our link to agriculture and so we know the vocabulary of agriculture and we know where everything comes from i do not want to take much more of the time of the gentleman but there are two basic things about agriculture we should cover no 1 the physical body the machine not the intellect or the soul how the good lord made us in his image and likeness i am not speaking about that i am speaking only of the machine the machine needs only three things for survival air water and food only the good lord makes are and water and only farmers and ranchers make food that is what it takes for the human physical body to survive then there is the matter of national security my colleague has listened to me many times on this and many of my other colleagues have also but when i was in the navy i never got on board a ship i will cover this very briefly when i came to congress they asked me what they could do for me i said get me on board a ship so i went on a ship on a carrier the biggest one i could get eventually i asked to get on a submarine i said i want to go on a nuclearpowered submarine and i did this is the triad we can defend our country on the ground in the air and on the water and also on a submarine under the water our adversaries know where our troops are they know where our planes are stationed they know where our missiles are but they do not know where our submarines are this is what is protecting the peace and security not only of this nation but of the free world when i asked the young commander of that ship how long can you keep this submarine under water he looked at me and said thats a military secret i said oh come on you can tell me he said well take a guess i am thinking of the core of the reactor the propellant and i guess 7 years is long zero is short and i said 4 years he said

introduction and welcoming me to participate i want to make the point we are not talking about democrat or republican here i think what we have to talk about is getting a job done and a job done for the country i think that the budget committee has had an extraordinary task to carry out nonpartisan and they have had to come and adjust many many areas and what they think is the right thing to do to the country having said that i do not believe that the budget process is over yet we have not voted nor has the senate voted as of this moment therefore if you would listen to this chairmans approach i rise to support this budget both with reluctance and with great distress it is a budget that asks us to accept a future of second best for american leadership in space it is a budget that asks us to dismember our civilian space program it is a budget that asks us to deny energy security for our future and it is a budget that asks us to vote no to a more competitive america in world markets the budget slashand i have to if you will forgive me speak to function 250cuts 1 1 billion below the presidents request and makes americas future in space read like an obituary i am not going to read the rest of my formal statement because i have a couple of questions that i want to ask and i think that this is a good place to do it but i want to get across to the members both democrat and republican what the argument about the space program is about it has nothing to do with our desire to take a widget and a gadget and fly another shuttle in spite of the terrible accidents we have flown them 24 times why should we be flying the shuttle again viz our leadership in space because it is a budgetsaving proposition we have 70 satellites both in the military the intelligence the pure sciences that we cannot fly because we do not have the vehicles to do it the department of defense has told us that there are four critical satellites that are scheduled to be flown come february of next year if we cut this program we are not going to be able to do that and it is going to exacerbate our situation as it relates to the security of this country now those are the facts we are second best in many areas because we cannot get our shuttles and our satellites up there and we cannot cut that money if we have to go and want to fly again if we want to at all we have to retrofit the other three orbiters that remain the other three shuttles otherwise we would be running the risk of one more explosion taking place nobody wants that on their conscience certainly i do not and i know that you do not but i think that it is imperative to get across to the budget committee that the future of amercas security and the future of americas leadership in space and high technology lies in that function of the budget now we speak of providing jobs for people and i applaud that we speak about providing resources for the homeless i applaud that and will vote for that we speak about need for additional health measures i will vote for that because it is the right thing to do but we are not to retreat we are saying to the great state of california be prepared to lay off 60 000 people we are saying to texas lay off another 60 000 people we are saying to florida cut down on your base lay off another 60 000 people because we are retreating from the opportunity of leadership to create new wealth that is what space and technology and competitiveness is about is to put our resources to create a new wealth and new job opportunities to say nothing of keeping our leadership as we are going so i would hope that as the budget committee reflects further and as we reflect in the process through the conference that the understanding of the order of magnitude of this issue will be laid to rest and the people of this country and the members of the house and the senate will understand the issue and do the things that ought to be done i rise to support this budget both with reluctance and

generate new science ideas and new payloads we will vote to cancel the hiring of 600 new graduates to provide new blood to an aging nasa we will vote to indefinitely delay building our space station while the russians continue to expand their already functioning space station these are just examples in the long list of cancellations and delays in nasa programs the bottom line for america is that we are endorsing the militarization of space by default if we vote to cripple the civilian space effort we automatically vote to reserve space exclusively for military purposes this betrays the intent

is to have alternatives to oil our department of energy r d budget funds the programs for developing those alternatives cutting energy r d funds means canceling americas insurance policy this nation sits on onefourth of the worlds supply of coal we need to develop and demonstrate the most economical methods to make liquid fuel from our coal we need to develop and demonstrate inherently safe nuclear reactors we need to continue research in fusion to insure alternative energy for future generations none of these programs can move ahead with continuous and predictable progress if we dont

today to assist the contra forces in nicaragua i sincerely hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support it as well since 1984 i have been working closely with a small group of house members seeking to fashion a truly bipartisan longterm united states policy in central america i am optimistic that a vote today for humanitarian aid will mark an important step in accomplishing that goal i know that for many of you this vote will not be easy i recognize that members on both extremes of the debate from the strongest supporters to the most critical opponents of contra aid are being asked to compromise and to accept a more mdoerate course nonetheless i hope that all members understand that this package offers the only promise of peace i am partially responsible for todays vote last january along with 19 of my colleagues i signed a letter to the president asking that he delay the military aid request that this house ultimately rejected on february 3 obviously however the president ignored our request and he lost as we warned after failing to persuade the president we approached speaker wright to seek a guarantee that a second vote on humanitarian aid would be allowed should the presidents request be rejected as it was when the guarantee was made i opposed the presidents package i said no to a military aid request during a delicate time in the peace process when such aid would likely destroy it so here we are today 1 month later voting again on aid to the contras but this is a different kind of aid and its passage will have a fundamentally different kind of impact on the peace process the package before us appropriates 30 8 million in assistance over the next 4 months 14 56 milton for food clothing and medicine for the contras 14 56 million for medical assistance for children on both sides of the conflict who are victims of the war and 1 44 million for humanitarian aid to the miskito and other indian groups in nicaragua in addition this package transfers authority to deliver the aid from the central intelligence agency to the department of defense all aid would be inspected onsite by the house and senate intelligence committees and the general accounting office if the sandinistas and contras agree to a ceasefire delivery would be transferred to an international voluntary agency such as the red cross finally the package cuts off delivery of previously authorized but undelivered lethal assistance and provides a mechanism controlled by congress for a vote on more aid sometime this summer given these provisions i am satisfied that the proposal offers the balance and compromise needed to nurture and to sustain a bipartisan united states policy in nicaragua and central america it reconciles the two principal but opposing concerns that further aid to the contras will upset the peace process and that more aid is needed to pressure the sandinista government by cutting off existing authorization of military aid limiting any new aid to food clothing and medicine and eliminating the role of the cia in delivery the package addresses the principal concerns of contra opponents it has the support of president arias of costa rica the author of the guatemala accords and guarantees that the peace process will continue in addition the 14 6 million for medical treatment of all children who are victims of the war introduces a new responsible dimension to unitedstates policy on the other hand the package asserts reasonable pressure on the sandinistas to comply with the peace planthe principal concern of contra supporters the aid would be provided before a ceasefire is agreed to thereby deterring the sandinistas from stalling during negotiations also it further encourages the sandinistas to negotiate by shifting delivery of the aid to an international organization such as the red cross should a ceasefire commence finally the provision for a summer vote signals to the sandinistas that we retain the option to change course should progress toward democracy in that country be unsatisfactory before concluding i would like to comment on one other subject that must be part of any sustainable longterm unitedstates policy in the region on february 23 1 cosigned a letter with 66 of my colleagues republicans and democrats alike and contra supporters and opponents as well urging the president to initiate negotiations with the soviet union to cease soviet military aid to the sandinista government to be sure the united states has legitimate security concerns in central america we are all aware that soviet support of the sandinistas has been substantial and continues and it must end the only way to cease such aid is by direct negotiations with the soviet union it is clear that regardless of the level of aid the contras are incapable of preventing the importation into nicaragua of the kind of hardware that would present a threat to our country nor are the contras capable of stemming the supply of arms as alleged by contra supporters from nicaragua to the armed opposition in other central american countries the press reported during the recent summit between the president and secretary gorbachev that the secretary offered to withdraw or reduce aid to nicaragua at this point the rumor has not been confirmed it has also been claimed that the soviets are tiring of their support and in fact refused to increase oil exports to nicaragua last year resulting in a serious gasoline shortage inside that country but whether or not either or both rumors are true the administration should initiate negotiations if we can turn off the pipeline the sandinistas will be further encouraged to negotiate i think that all of us here can and should support this effort i would like to congratulate the members of the task force who drafted the proposal before us today it is a sensible package that reflects political reality not everyone will be satisfied particularly those at the extremes who oversimplify the debate the vote today is not a vote for or against communism as contra suipporters often claim nor is it a vote for or against violence and murder as contra opponents allege and it is not a vote about goals but about means it is a vote on a package that seeks to apply subtle pressure during a delicate stage of diplomacy in order to obtain our goal of

inherent in the dairy price support program when it established the support reduction privision in the farm bill this was designed as a followup to the chaotic dairy buyout program to deny this reduction now is to fly in the face of an agreement that was reached in the 1985 farm bill promises were made in the last congress the dairy industry got the whole herd buyout program when it accepted the prospect of a reduction in the support price level if purchases of surplus products remained high after the buyout the levels of surplus are still unacceptably high congress should not now turnaround and tell the cattle industry and others that a deal made last year is null and void now section 662 is a poorly conceived solution to whatever problem is perceived because of casein imports certainly decisions about agriculture price supports should be made in agriculture legislation not hidden behind the pretense of trade and with the uruguay gatt negotiation coming up shortly the relationship between casein and the ills of the dairy industry can certainly better be addressed at that time but trade is not at the heart of this issue the issue is the anxiety in the dairy industry about being weaned even slightly from their price supports i understand that anxiety but the evidence is clear the supports as constructed are insensitive to market constraints they are damaging to the consumer as well as related industries and they result in massive over supplies of dairy commodities the plan outlined in the farm bill was designed to reduce the dairy surplus in the most sensitive way possible but the problems are real and real solutions are what is needed not delays or evasions it may be a bitter pill for them to swallowbut sometimes whats good for us doesnt always taste so good it would be impossible to construct an argument to say that the 50cent reduction in price supports could do any serious harm to the industry if we dont stick with the farm bill agreement and lower price supports then its possible that another supply adjustment program will be needed that is the worst possible answer to surplus commodity problems the pain of price support cuts to industry pales in comparison to the pain experienced by other industries as a result of the buyout according to the farm bureau the supply and demand imbalance is improving as a result of the buyout

thing over and over again but mr president it is not hopeless we are going to pass legislation that will effectively deal with the trade problem despite the administrations opposition several months ago we passed an excellent trade bill the legislation we are now considering is obviously inferior it is indeed sad that the ban on export of alaskan oil and the plantclosing provision had to be eliminated to gain the administrations backing the two provisions the president specifically singled out as most unacceptable were among the most attractive provisions in the bill we have dropped those provisions to gain the administrations support by doing so we are sacrificing our energy security and delaying enactment of an important protection for american workers while it is unfortunate

consists of 460 privately owned ships and only 376 are in active service the commission on merchant marine and defense has presented to the president a series of reports graphically outlining the sad state of our martime industry among the commissions most frightening conclusions are that the shipyard base cannot meet our defense needs and that we have neither the ships nor the trained seafarers to support even a limited conventional war the general public doesnt worry too much about how their japanese cars get here or what flag the vessels in port are flying unlike the steel automobile and

fair housing throughout the country unfortunately the law has not been effective because it lacks an effective enforcement mechanism if conciliation fails the aggrieved party must file an action in court unlike other civil rights laws the government is not the enforcer in individual cases the victim is the enforcerin federal courtand it doesnt work president reagan agrees that reform is necessary his words are the gap in enforcement is the lack of a forceful backup mechanism which provides an incentive to bring the parties to the conciliation table with serious intent to resolve the dispute then and there this lack of enforcement mechanism has resulted in tragic discrimination in every part of our country hud estimates that 2 million instances of housing discrimination occur each year here in washington and in the virginia and maryland suburbs a 1987 study found that blacks were discriminated against 57 percent of the time similar studies in other parts of the country reveal the same distressing patternsin califorina houston phoenix boston denver chicago we confidently believe that the legislation before you provides the necessary mechanism promptly at low cost and in a sound constitutional form it works like this when someone believes that he or she has been or is about to be subjected to housing discrimination that person files a complaint with hud the hud secretary then investigates the complaint and at this time must engage the parties in conciliation if conciliation fails and the investigation by the secretary finds reasonable cause to believe there has been a discriminatory housing practice the secretary then issues a charge at this point under an amendment that will be offered by mr fish and which i strongly support any party hs the right to elect to have a trial by jury in federal court if no party elects to go to court then within 120 days there is a hearing before an administrative law judge at hud if the auj finds the respondent has

second violation with 5 yeas or up to 50 000 for a subsequent violation within 7 years the committee is confident that this speedy fair and inexpensive procedure will fill the gap in enforcement and ensure that conciliation will resolve these cases the heart of the bill is the new mechanism i have described we want these cases resolved by conciliation between the parties we are convinced that conciliation under present law ineffective will work if the parties understand that proceedings before an ai await them if conciliation fails this was the mechanism provided for in the fair housing bill that passed the house in june 1980 by a vote of 310 to 95 unfortunately the senate was unable to break a filibuster falling short by 6 votes of the 60 needed the committee reported the bill this year by a strong bipartisan vote of 26 to the bill makes no major changes in existing enforcement provisions private litigation in federal courts is still provided the attorney general can prosecute where a pattern or practice of discrimination exists the bill continues current law that provides for cases to be referred to state or local fair housing agencies if the state or local agency is substantially equivalent as to rights and remedies we encourage local or state enforcement the legislation also prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap the landlord must allow the handfcapped tenant at lhe tenants expense to make reasonable necessary modifications to the dwelling new construction of multifamily dwellings must be designed so that common use portions of the dwellings are readily accessible and usable by handicapped persons doors must be wide enough for passage by wheelchairs and the units must contain features that would make them adaptable for use by handicapped persons im talking here about an accessible route through the unit light switches and other controls which are not too high or too low reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars and usable kitchens and bathrooms these requirements will be of minimal cost tud estimates that the cost of providing such features will be less than 1 percent of the cost of a unit new york state estimates a cost between 400 to 480 per unit the national association of home builders estimates a cost of 364 per unit this estimate is based on a 1979 study of the actual costs of providing these features we have tried with this provision to make ordinary housing 6available to handicapped persons neither handicapped persons nor landlords want a small number of specialized landicap units that look like hospital rooms many states have similar or far greater requirements than in this bill the bill also prohibits discrimination against families with children and the need here is compelling approximately 40 percent of american households have children under 18 but a hud survey reflects 25 percent of all rental units do not allow children and 50 percent were subject to restrictive policies that limited the ability of families to live in those units studies in california reveal the staggering statistics that of rental units refusing to admit children were 71 percent in los angeles 70 percent in san jose and 65 percent in san diego the discrimination against children is epidemic and 16 states have some laws prohibiting this dismaying practice we were careful in writing the bill to make clear exception for housing for older persons senior citizens who live in retirement communities will not be forced to live with children last let me reemphasize the necessity for this bill housing affordable for middle and lowincome families is in short supply new units not being built and so the probability of discrimination is acut2 there are few experiences more humiliating more cruel than to be denied housing because of your race handicap or because you have children but the discrimination is out there mr chairman and my colleagues it is pervasive in our

recognition of the significance of womens athletic achievements by drawing attention to women in sports we can recognize women athletes who serve as examples of the avenues available through which women of america may develop physical fitness selfdiscipline initiative confidence and leadership skills national women in sports day while recognizing the outstanding accomplishments of women in sports will also point to the fact that women students still have far fewer opportunities for athletic achievements than men at the same institutions today women repre sent 35 percent of all collegiate athletes however the athletic opportunities for male students at both the college and high school levels still far exceeds those for female students women comprise 52 percent of college enrollments but only one dollar in five of financial aid based on athletic ability is awarded to women while i applaud the progress that has been made over the last 15 years i believe we february 1988 must also acknowledge the large inequities that still exist for women in the area of athletics national women in sports day will be a step toward giving women in sports the recognition and attention

from massachusetts for his work on h1 r 2213 together we have crafted bipartisan consensus legislation that addresses a real problem in this nation we have accomplished it in an effective manner that takes into account the needs of the affected industries and of the public needless to say this is frequently a difficult task the bill before us will accomplish a great deal it will ultimately provide the hearing impaired with the same access to nearly every telephone injoyed by the rest of the public that is and should be an important public policy objective the testimony heard by the telecommunications subcommittee during our hearing on h r 2213 in february suggested that some kinds of telephones should be exempted from the bills reach h r 2213 exempts many kinds of telephone services such as land mobile and cellular radio in which h9aring aid compatibility is not now possible to achieve economically the bill also creates a technology exception through which new telephone services can grow until it is possible to make them compatible with hearing aid technology in a costeffective way h r 2213 also ensures that the development of new telephone services and of new hearing aid technology will be stimulated riot stifled in the emerging information age full undiminished use of all telephones by all of our citizens will be even more important than it is today h r

encourage its memberships support of second harvest through contributions of uri1111084 gently needed food in simple terms poor people are losing access to tons of food that they critically need because of inflexible tax policy the conference agreement before us today remedies this situation by allowing the irs to apply to closely held corporations making donations to food banks eligible for

today and that is that foreign ownership of american banks farmland manufacturing companies and every other type of asset has doubled in the last 5 years the committee on energy and commercehas brought forward a reasonable proposal which requires only significant amounts of foreign investment to be reported here not in complicated form nothing difficult nothing expensive in fact all that has to be reported is the identity and nationality of the foreign investor the date that the interest was acquired the size of it and the purchase price of the interest in the unique case where control of a privately held company is sold to a foreign investor then that company has to begin filing the same thing and no more that our publicly held corporations have to file at the present time and that is

the federal savings and loan insurance corporation recapitalization act the congress and the american people should accept no delay in enacting this important and urgently needed legislation the issue is quite clear the fslic which insures the deposits at more than 3 000 thrift institutions holding over 1 trillion in deposits has sustained steady losses since 1981 when the fund stood at 6 3 billion compared to a defict today there is no choice but to recapitalize the fund the amount of recapitalization is important but whether it be 5 10 15 billion or more it should not stand in the way of this congress moving expeditiously to create the mechanism to raise the funds and to provide the proper protection to consumers deposits at the nations savings and loans the fslic was created more than 50 years ago by the national housing act to insure the deposits held at the nations savings and loans since that time the s l industry has become important to both the enconomy and society as the holder of over a trillion dollars in funds it is an important participant in the financial services marketplace and as the lender of the majority of home mortgage funds it deserves a great deal of credit for making america a nation of homeowners when the fslic was created in 1934 only 35 percent of american families owned their home compared to over 60 percent today the continuing role of savings and loans in our society and among financial institutions needs to be protected and preserved the legislation we are considering today is vitally important to the preservation of a separate and distinct thrift industry from 1981 to 1986 211 s ls were merged with other institutions or liquidated at the same time the number of insolvent thrifts climbed from 16 in 1980 to 445 last year despite the current condition of the fslic consumers should be reassured that the full faith and credit of the unitedstates government stands behind the fslic moreover the losses that have occured from the failure of some s ls is not reflective of the general condition of the industry according to the general accounting office a substantial segment of the industry is both solvent and profitable as of september 1986 about 85 percent of fslic insured s ls were solvent at the same time 80 percent of the industry recorded aggregate profits of 6 9 billion during the first three quarters of 1986 consumers should be aware that the current problems of the fslic should not be generalized to the entire thrift industry the bill before us today will set the s l industry on the straight course to recovery by combining measures to increase the insurance fund provide forbearance to help well manged thrifts over temporary difficulties and require strict oversight of the regulatory process to ensure everyones rights and interests are protected specifically the bill provides for the creation of a financing corporation to serve as the mechanism for raising the funds necessary to replenish the insurance fund additionally the bill provides a forebearance program to relieve the financial burden affecting institutions and borrowers in designated economically depressed areas the committee acted to ensure that an institution can not participate in the forebearance program if its weakened capital position is the result of imprudent operating practices the bill also imposes exit or penalty fees on any institution leaving the insurance fund after the recapitalization plan is implemented this is a reasonable and responsible measure to respond to extraordinary conditions that necessitate our expenditious consideration and approval i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure i also want to commend my colleagues on the banking committee who exercised their responsibilities with respect to this legislation so diligently lets protect our constituents deposits and pass this legislation today"]]}
