important public health issue every april to raise awareness about leading health problems affecting our nation this year the theme of national public health week focuses on what is called the built environment which refers to building healthy communities to protect and enhance our childrens life the built environment is any infrastructure with which children come in contact on a daily basis including homes schools parks roads walkways and businesses enhancements to ihe bilt environment include accb6 so primary health services regular v99 ical activity safe places to play and safe routes to walk or bike to school smokefree communities and homes and toxinfree schools health challenges include the quality of and access to schools and housing economic opportunities social capital air and water and opportunities for physical activity as chair of the congressional asian pacific american caucus i am particularly concerned about how the built environment affects communities of color native communities and linguistically isolated communities members of these communities are more likely to live work and play in environments which have detrimental health effects often vastly disproportionate to their percentage of the population for example asthma is one of the major causes of illness and disability in the united states although asthma is only slightly more prevalent among minority children than among whites it accounts for three times the number of deaths low socioeconomic status exposure to urban environmental contaminants and lack of access to medical care contribute to the increase of deaths in minority communities african americans living in lowincome neighborhoods have particularly high rates of asthma as do native hawaiians living in hawaii america must invest more resources and be more creative in order to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities we need to provide access to health care for the 45 million uninsured more than half of whom are racial and ethnic populations we need to provide linguistically and culturally competent services and we need to stop gutting the health care safety net neighborhoods and communities across the united states are segregated by race and socioeconomic status which exacerbates the underlying social and economic inequities that perpetuate health inequities without significant investment in the built environmen4 for children and underserved communities these health inequities will continue i am pleased to see that the american public health association the leading public health organization in the united states has been able to disseminate the message about the interconnectedness between health and the built environment and hope that this reality is integrated into the public health

conservative democrats that are concerned about the state of affairs in america we are concerned about the debt the deficit the budget and we are committed to trying to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government and our nations budgeting process ever since i was a small child growing up in prescbtt emmet and hope arkansas i always heard it was the democrats that spent the money and yetit was a president named bill clinton from arkansas from my hometown of hope arkansas in fact that gave this nation its first balanced budget in 40 years from 1988 through 2001 america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having its fiscal house in order america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having a balanced budget it is hard now to believe that from 1998 through 2001 this country had a balanced budget because as we all know for the sixth year in a row this nation under this republicanled congress and under this president this administration has given us the largest budget deficit ever ever in our nations history for a sixth year in a row as a matter of fact as you walk the halls of congress it is easy to spot a fiscally conservative democrat because the 37 of us who belong to the blue dog coalition have this poster outside our office in the halls of congress as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 365 525 832 151 and some change that is a big number let us put it in a way that we all can understand it for every man woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can complete 169 and with these two interstates we can bring economic opportunities and jobs to one of the most depressed

for yielding me the customary 30 minutes i yield myself 5 minutes democrats have been saying again and again and again and again the american people want and deserve a clean upordown vote on raising the minimum wage and this rule does not provide for such a vote minimumwage workers want and deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that

until 2 days ago it was totallya biparwill tell you that they have authorized tisan effort as you can see in their an additional 200 on the pel grant substitute they include many of the that will barely have any effect on this things that we have in the underlying graph but more importantly las bill we have a basic difference of opinnight their budget committee did not ion that the gentleman has pointed report out a budget that has that out money in it so it is interesting rhet i ook at it a little differently than oric but it does not have any money he does i feel it is not totally the

it is important for vote for the substitute amendment to all of us to come together to solve this make a downpayment on reversing the problem not simply the federal govnew costs that are imposed on these ernment to pick up whatever the diffamilies and these students who are ference is as schools continue to instruggling to purchase an education crease their fees and tuition the fedthat raid on

they want about i yield such time as he the additional money going to pell may consume to the gentleman fromgrant it is an entitlement program florida the chairman of but the fact of the matter is the money the subcommittee on higher eduthat students are getting is covering a cation to let him furthergo into some lower percentage of the cost that they bf the differences and some of the encounter when they go to schobl things that we have done in the past this is a fundamental determination and some of the things that we do in pick your side folks you can be on the underlying bill for the importance the side of tax cuts for the oil compa of higher educati6n foi our students of fies or you can decide you are going to this country help families and students that are mr keller i bestruggling to get what is now abso lieve the american people are entitled lutely essential to their future partici to some straight talk when it comes to pation in americas economy higher education funding this bill strengthens pell grants it expands perkins student loans and increases access to college for millions of students now mr miller has a substitute that he would like us to vote for but it has three critical flaws the first flaw is the name itself reverse the raid on student aid dont believe the hype not one student in america will receive less financial aid under our bill not one the heart of our bill is pell grants the heart of all financial aid on the federal level now lets look at the history of pell grant funding over the 20 years and see if republicans are in fact making quote a raid on student aid the yellow here shows the time period of 10 years when democrats were in control of congress and the red shows when republicans were in control of congress you see a dramatic increase in the maximum pell grant award does this look like a raid on student aid to you you have got to be kidding me in fact what is really instructive is if you lo6k at the last 3 years when the democrats were in control they had a democrat house and a democrat presi dent bill clinton and they actually cut pell grant funding 3 years in a row it went from 2 400 down to 2 300 the second critical flaw with the miller substitute is this amendment does not retain the 6 000 maximum pell grant award that our legislation has in fact they stay with the same old 5 800 maximum award so this substitute legislation reverse theraid on student aid provides less for pell grants instead of 6 000 5 800 how could that possibly be that we have a democrat substitute that actually calls for less awards of pell grants well dont call it a comeback we have been here for years it happened before their last 3 years in power cut pell grants here w6 have another attempt to do the same thing it has a third flaw it says that we are going to have a 3 4 percent interest rate for 1 year that is going to cost 2 7 billion but it has no offsets whatsoever how do they pay for it they dont tell us well if it is just a gimmick to have a lower rate without any way to pay for it why make it 3 4 percent why not 2 percent why not 1 percent why not interestfree loans it is crazy the truth of the matter is in 2002 republicans and democrats and student groups all got together and decided in a bipartisan manner what would be a fair fixed interest rate they decided on 6 8 percent they voted in favor of this in 2002 the democrats who offer this motion in fact in december of this last year when we supposedly cut all this money it was going to be the interest rates were going to remain at 6 8 percent that is the existing law and in fact in july they would go to 6 8 percent how inuch is the interest rate in our bill 6 8 percent no increase whatsoever and so now they are opposing something that they all thought was a good idea so i would argue that we have a pretty darn good bill that we can be proud of a bill that increases pell grants a bill that expands perkins loans abill that is going to make it possible for young people all across america to go to college i urge my colleagues to vote no on the miller substitute and vote yes on the underlying bill"], [6.99758529663086e-05,

wealthiest among us they want to make permanent the cuts in capital gains taxes they want to reward wealth not work and they want to make permanent the cuts in dividend taxes in order to facilitate that they want to cut these other programs they want to benefit approximately 1 percent of the society those who earn over 300 000 a year and have estates worth more than 6 million but one thing we have got to give them is they are relentless and consistent and they are successful last year the irs says that 99 percent of the people in america saw their real incomes decline everybody who earned less than 300 000 after inflation saw a decline up to 1 3 million they did okay over 1 3 million they did phenomenonally well now the presidents tax commission says that is exactly what the future should be that is trickle down we want more for the wealth not for those who work their proposals are extraordinary they would say that dividends should be free of tax so if one is someone who is lucky enough to be born into a wealthy family they inherit millions of dollars and they invest it in dividendpaying stocks they would never pay a penny in federal taxes because they are a wealth creator they are a job generator they are trickling down on the rest of america is that not nice of them but they would not contribute to the society and then we have stocks well on stocks they want to say 75 percent of the gain should be taxfree again benefiting for the most part the same people but the funny thing they are doing here is they want to talk about wealth creators and entrepreneurs but they stick it to the small business people if one has a small business they build it up and they sell it for a million bucks guess what their tax rate is 33 percent under the presidents new proposal but if they have been speculating in the stock market they would only have to pay at 8 percent if they had been happy enough or lucky enough to inherit money and clip dividend coupons they would have paid 0 percent but no if they built up their small business they are going to pay 33 percent and those suckers who work for a living they will pay on every penny of income somebody who earns 25 000 a year will pay a tax rate at about three times the person who invests in stocks and realizes capital gains this is their vision of the world trickle down economics trickling on the majority of america and last year trickling on 99 percent of the people in america it is working well they say and we should do more of the same and ironically they want to borrow money to perpetuate

for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the

signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it poverty is on the rise in our country 37 million americans are now in poverty i a family of two in povertya single mother with her child is living on 1 069 a month about 14 million americans are living on half of poverty a single mother with her child living at half of poverty is trying to survive on 535 a month that is two people living on 123 37 a week and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in

programs in colombia have long been an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars the data we have from the national drug intelligence center at the department of justice with respect to the success of this

grown in colombia either after spending over 4 billion and spending nearly 6 years have we even cut coca production in half no we have decreased by less than 7 percent the number of hectares of coca

what i believe to be one of the most compelling issues facing this country and it is our energy issue energy is what makes everything run it heats our homes it makes our businesses run it helps us transport ourselves and goods from place to place energy is a part of everything we do now i come from right near titusville pennsylvania where the first oil well was drilled and nothing has changed the world more than when we found petroleum and how it developed our whole industrial revolution in this country and we became the leaders of the world and how we developed our transportation system but today you know we hear a lot about the price of oil because it is published daily and we hear a lot about the price of gasoline at the pump and that is important to us and it has been painful some time back when we hit over 3 for gasoline but folks when gasoline prices were at 3 they had doubled in the 5year period the real issue facing america is the price of natural gas which has increased 700 percent in the same period of time 5 years why is it a crisis well the impact is we heat our homes it could threaten homeownership we heat our schools our hospitals our ymcas our ywcas our churches our colleges our universities our small businesses yes everybody uses natural gas in some way from cooking to baking to heating their homes running something and we have major industries like steel aluminum brass all our metals that melt steel that heat it to bend it or shape it petrochemicals they use natural gas as a heat they use natural gas as an ingredient every chemical that we buy in the grocery store or the hardware store is a derivative of natural gas polymers and plastics we do not have anything that does not have polymers or plastics connected to them again polymers and plastics a major ingredient is natural gas and of course it is used again and again to melt it and to shape it fertilizer our farmers have been devastated this year with huge increases in fertilizer cost nitrogen fertilizer the one most common 70 percent of the cost of fertilizer is natural gas so our farmers have been hit very hard with the energy crisis because they have paid a lot more to run their tractors to cultivate their farms they have paid again to harvest their crops they have paid with natural gas to dry the grains before they put them in storage in the big elevators they have been hit with natural gas every way they turn i why are natural gas prices more harmful than oil prices well when we buy 65 oil as it was a few weeks ago or 58 or 59 or 60 oil as it is today that is the world price and all our competitors far and wide around the world pay that same price but that is not true of natural gas when we paid 14 for several months we are down around 12 now maybe 11 still the highest price in the records that have ever been kept we are alone we are the only country paying that canada is considerably cheaper europe is usually about half of our price our economic competitors japan taiwan and china a third of our price thinking of giving all those manufacturers and processors over there another huge advantage over us economically not only cheap labor but cheap energy how can our employers compete when energy is a large part of their cost the fact is they cannot i was today at a celebration of the expansion of a lime company that put in new kilns and invested 60 million in my district and i asked them what fuel do you use to fuel these kilns to make lime because you heat it to 2 400 degrees and they said we use coal and i said you can be glad you do and they said well we have plants all over the states we have plants in canada and plants in mexico we have natural gas plants and i said well how are they faring and they said well we are not running those todays natural gas prkces we cannot afford to make lime folks the problem we face with the natural gas prices that are going to be high for a long time to come they are going to be devastating to homeownership they are going to be devastating to small business but they are going to force major companies to leave this country because if they want to compete if they want to make products that are saleable you cannot pay three four and five times as much 2145 in south america natural gas is only 1 60 in russia it is only 90 cents and i named all of our other competitors how did this happen well for decades gas was under 2 and oil was around 10 nothing competes none of the renewables none of the new initiatives work with those cheap cheap prices that we had for a long time now about 10 years ago we changed a major policy in this country historically it was against the law to use natural gas to make electricity it was considered not prudent i think we were right then but that was changed and so 10 years ago we took away the limitation of using natural gas to make electricity and today onefourth of our electricity is made with natural gas so huge reserves of natural gas now go into making electricity now i remember at the same time when that was happening i went to a briefing in the senate and a daniel yergin who wrote the book the prize a pulitzer prizewinning book he said if we used a lot of natural gas to make electricity and we did not open up supply in a few years we would develop a real shortage of natural gas in this country that happened because i remember the first year that it reached up over 3 that was from under 2 gas to over 3 that was a major bump in the cost of heating our homes and running our businesses well the next year it was up in the high 4s and that again was a huge percent increase of natural gas costs and we all watched and learned the next year the average price last year the average price for natural gas during the summer months when we fill our storage in the summertime we produce more gas than we can use and we put it in huge caverns many of them in my district in pennsylvania and we store it for winter usage because we do not produce enough in wintertime last summer the average price was 5 30 that was the highest price we ever paid for summer gas it was very alarming to those who watched that this year was even worse we were bouncing along between 7 and 8 all summer and those were waiting for new contracts waiting for the price to come down it just never happened then as we were approaching the fall we got up to around 9 gas and sometimes even close to 10 and then came katrina and the other storms and a shortage of gas coming outof the gulf and we hit 14 50 and that was a record for gas prices in this country and it stayed there for some month or two and now just recently has edged down into the elevens but still it is way above we were talking this summer that probably sometime this winter when the cold canadian air comes down into the states that we could be looking at 10 and 11 gas this winter well we are back at 10 and 11 gas now and we think that is pretty good compared to 14 a few weeks ago but it is a huge shock to our system it is not a price companies can pass on i have companies in my district that when it reached 8 they do not produce any more because they cannot pass that on that cost makes it prohibitive now how did this all happen what could we do to fix it well we have huge reserves in our west and we have huge reserves on our outer continental shelf what is the outer continental shelf that is our shoreline the states control the first 3 miles of the outer continental shelf and then for the next 197 miles 200 miles is controlled by the federal government historically most countries in the world produce oil and natural gas there but about 20some years ago the president of the united states put a moratorium it was supposed to be temporary it was while we had an inventory to see where the best supplies were so we could open up with the least environmental damage so that moratorium carried into the clinton administration and they just extended it to 2012 and our current administration has not dealt with it well that has closed up 80 percent of our shoreline with huge reserves some estimate that it is 400 trillion cubic feet others feel it is far in excess of that because we have never used the most modern seismographic equipment to tell us what is there today if we did that because congress has not allowed us to we have not allowed the outer continental shelf to be measured with the modern technology of today to tell us how much oil and gas is there because if we found out there was a lot we might go after it and that would be a terrible thing to do well i am sorry but there has never been a natural gas well that has ever polluted a shore i am promoting natural gas production and i will explain my legislation a little later here but we have also not had a major spill from oil production in the water since 1969 i do not know how long the industry has to be perfect before we can do it there and be trusted in the gulf when we had the series of storms that hit this year the worst ever a 60foot wall of water rigs were destroyed platforms were destroyed but there were no major spills because the technology that we have today works the wells are locked in at the ocean floor and the gas and oil is held there until we can repair the platforms until we can reconnect those wells and get them back into the system so it is safe technology today well how safe is it how can we be sure well canada is a very environmentally sensitive country they produce right off the coast of maine and right off the coast of washington they actually drill for natural gas in our great lakes every day and sell the gas to us does that make sense i do not think so the united kingdom an environmentally sensitive country they produce a lot of their oil and gas both on their outer continental shelf belgium norway sweden and norway very green countries where do they produce their energy on their outer continental shelf new zealand australia produce there every day our future depends on the price of energy if we are going to have businesses that compete if we are going to be able to afford home ownership if churches are going to be able to heat their churches this winteri have churches in my district that are talking about not using the auditoriums but using their basements and not heating the rest of the church because they will not be able to afford to most of the churches and schools and small businesses in my district had 6 and 7 contracts for natural gas last year they buy outside the controlled system they buy direct fromthe producers and they use the pipeline that the public system has and all of them have had a doubling not a 10 percent increase not a 20 percent increase but a doubling of their gas costs for this year so if a ymca spent 12 000 last a month for natural gas this year it will cost them 24 000 most ymcas most churches most small businesses do not have those kinds of cash reserves to use to heat their buildings now who opposes our production on the ocs well i have to be honest we have a lot of good friends in florida and i love them dearly but the florida delegation and florida state government has been a real obstacle to production on the outer continental shelf they have really been much of the dictation of policy and for i believe all the wrong reasons now the plan we have is the petersonabercrombie plan we want to remove the moratorium on all of our shoreline for natural gas only we will give the states 20 miles of protection instead of 3 so when you get past 12 miles it is all out of sight nobody will know it is there the production lines are all underground coming into the shore and it is the best and most sensitive environmental way to produce natural gas and there is no good argument i have yet to have anyone show me an accident in the history of the production of natural gas offshore of a natural gas well ever polluting a beach ever polluting a shoreline ever causing detrimental damage to fish and aquatic life all the studies have shown that aquatic life and fish life are far more prevalent where platforms and drilling rigs have been because they like the protection from the hot sun they congregate there and the fishermen find that that is the best fishing that has been historic in the gulf when there was talk about not rebuilding some of the platforms the fishermen were saying please leave them there please do not take them out that is where we catch our fish so it is not detrimental to aquatic life it is not detrimental to clean beaches it is not a sight problem because you cannot see it it is but of sight but it is about our home owners it is about our businesses it is about our employers our churches our ys our schools there has never been a natural gas well that has polluted a beach or shoreline someone said in a debate the other day that there was no sense in doing this that it would take 7 to 10 years for production that is not true it would take several years for production now tract 181 in the gulf i think it is a tragedy that it has not been leased it was scheduled to be leased during the clinton administration and here we are 6 years later and tract 181 has never produced now tract 181 is about 200 miles from the florida coast it lies mostly under mississippi and alabama it only gets near to florida along the panhandle of florida and i am told now they will cut the corner off so it is more than 100 miles from florida which really florida should have never had any jurisdiction or should never have been able to stop the use and leasing of tract 181 tract 181 is the best known reserve we have it is millions of acres right beside where we produce in the gulf today and every well that was drilled would automatically be hooked into the system gas or oil and we could help our supply problem now i do not believe we can drill our way out of the oil problem in this country i think we ought to be diverting from the use of oil everywhere we can but natural gas is really the almost perfect fuel there is no pollution to natural gas it burns the cleanest of any fuel even co2 you have one fourth of the co2 that you have with other fuels it is almost the perfect fuel now i do not particularly think we should be using a fourth of our natural gas for electric generation but that is a debate for another day but we have to open up our supply so prices moderate what could that do for us natural gas could be very much a part of our transportation system we have a bus system in my district state college that uses all natural gas for their bus system there are bus systems in california that are all natural gas today those systems are paying a premium historically natural gas was less expensive than gasoline but today it is more expensive now in the cities if you used natural gas and a gasoline engine can be easily converted this is not some expensive technology all our shorthaul delivery trucks all our taxi cabs all of school buses all our construction vehicles they do not have to go long distances could be running on natural gas saving the need to build refineries saving the need to import more oil and in the cities helping them get attainment for the clean air mandates natural gas should be the bridge to our future not the wall that it is today because of prices no one can afford natural gas is almost our clean perfect fuel and we heed to be using it wisely we need to be producing it though in quantities that are affordable it really is a part of almost everything we create from fertilizers to all the chemicals even face creams now i do not think the average woman when she puts on makeup or any of us who use skin softeners think we are using natural gas but we are those are all made from a derivative of natural gas it is just so much a part of our lives it is almost hard to explain an item that we get out of the ground gas with all of these qualities that have such a part of our industries now when these prices increase 700 perc6nt companies who use huge amounts of that just cannot exist as i said earlier the lime companies told me they were not running their plants that are on natural gas they could not afford to sell the lime if they did that so just think of a steel company i spoke this spring at a breakfast of steel makers and i gave them my natural gas speech and a gentleman sitting at my table was quite alarmed he said i cannot believe what you just told me and i said why and he said i used 10 million of natural gas last year to melt steel f1 2200 i never knew i thought there was a little price differential but i never knew there was this huge differential that my steel companies in neighboring countries could buy natural gas so much cheaper and have such an economic advantage on me in making steel folks if we are going to have steelmaking in this country if we are going to make aluminum in this country aid petrochemicals and fertilizer and these are some of the best jobs we have left they are all huge energy consumers they all use huge amounts of natural gas if our seniors who are approaching their years and want to live in their homes they are going to use a lot of natural gas to heat them to heat their water and cook with the current prices of natural gas are going to prevent homeownership we are going to have a lot of people shut off this winter who could not afford to pay their gas bills and they will be terminated we caneven actually have people freeze to death in our cities where people do not know they are there and do not know that they are having the problem so i just find it an argument that i have been making for some time here in congress and i guess i have been so shocked and surprised that we have not been successful yet at opening up the outer continental shelf and opening up the production in the midwest the outer continentalshelf i think this is the most advantageous thing to do because the outer continental shelf lies near the population the bulk of the population in this country is along the shorelines and so when you produce gas along the shorelines you are going to have it near where the people are one of our problems of midwest gas is getting it to the market needs we are told this winter that wisconsin and i4innesota and michigan those areas are going to pay considerably more for natural gas than the northeast because they are supplied out of the gulf more than the northeast is so with the gulf having so much of their gas still shut in from the storms there is going to be a shortage in their pipeline system because these systems are not all connected i want to share with you what the associated industries of florida said and then i am going to call on my friend from new mexico who has just joined ua but while we have had all this opposition from the government of florida we also have the associated industries of florida wrote a letter to our minerals management service saying we appreciate that mms is going to review all of the current ocs areas including the areas that have until now been off limits due to the moratoria which incluae the atlantic pacific and eastern gulf of mexico regions research documents that these areas hold substantial undiscovered but technically recoverable energy resources that will be absolutely critical to americas national security and to the continued growth of our economy and to securing jobs for virtually every sector of our economy they go on to say later in the letter if america doesnt look to expanding exploration and drilling in these ocss then america will unnecessarily pay a high price and incur a heavy burden the unitedstates energy information administration forecasts that by 2025 petroleum demand will increase by 39 percent and natural gas demand will increase by 34 percent higher energy prices have exacted a toll on our economy by slowing our growth from between 5 to 1 percent based on prehurricane prices farmers have paid 6 billion more for energy in the last 2 years natural gas costs for the chemical industry in america have increased by 10 billion since 2003 of 120 chemical plants this is an alarming figure being built around the world with price tags of 1 billion or more only one is being built in the unitedstates as a result associated industries of florida this is 10 000 business people recommends to the mms that expanded lease sales are important to our country to our citizens and to our way of life to not utilize all of our available energy resources when it can be accomplished in an environmentally sensitive way would be a disservice to our country we need to ensure that we have a brighter future by adopting an expansive ocs leasing program i am pleased to be joined by the gentleman from new mexico who understands this issue maybe even better than i and i yield to the gentleman from new mexico"],

in american history specifically fort king is the site where chief osceola fought against the united states in a chapter of american history the second seminole war from 18351842 my home and representative ric kellers ocala florida is home to fort king this fort played a direct role in the founding of florida as a state secretary of the interior gale norton designated fort king a national historic landmark on february 24 2004 to our great delight then in november 2005 fort king entered a draft special resource study and environmental impact statement public comment period this continues and we look forward to moving fort king along in the process of preservation and now i am working towards preserving fort king in perpetuity as a national park my good friend and colleague in the neighboring district the honorable ric keller who also represents ocala has collaborated with me on this effort historic sites are a vital link between current and future generations of americans and those who came before us these landmarks give context to the national experience and help us understand our past so that we can envision our future what happened at fort king it is a very long story about which i will elaborate longer on another occasion the abbreviated story is that on december 28 1835 fort king was the site of an outbreak of hostilities between the united states government and the seminole indians the seminoles were led in this attack by chief osceola this attack began the second seminole war which lasted longer than any other united states armed conflict except for the vietnam war chief osceolas first appearance to the world was at fort king in october 1834 the defiant young war chief rejected the unitedstates orders to leave florida and threatened war unless the seminoles were left alone there was no trust left between the unitedstates army and the seminoles then came the fateful day of december 28 1835 that morning 40 miles to the south along the fort king road the seminoles ambushed and annihilated two companies of unitedstates army regulars in route to fort king that afternoon osceola shot and killed the indian agent wiley thompson outside the walls of fort king the second seminole war had begun during the 7 year guerrilla war that followed every major general and every regiment of the unitedstates army was stationed at or passed through fort king men who would gain fame in the mexican and civil wars and here stood the enlisted men bemrose clarke and hundreds of others who served in the florida war following the initial series of engagements most of which the seminoles won unitedstates forces withdrew from the interior of florida abandoning fort king in may 1836 the seminoles stood victorious and burned the hated fort king to the ground but it would be a short lived victory when the army returned a year later and rebuilt fort king when it finally ended in 1842 most of the seminoles had been killed or captured and relocated to indian territory in oklahoma these native americans constitute the seminole nation of today an unconquered and defiant few withdrew to the vastness of the florida everglades and survived to the present as the seminole tribe of florida in march 1843 fort king was abandoned by the unitedstates army for the last time and transferred to the people of marion county the fort was used as the countys first courthouse and public building in 1846 it was dismantled by the citizens of marion county for its lumber the great pines had done their job fort king and the surrounding area contain artifacts used in the attack and in the life of the seminole indians preserving our past for our children and grandchildren is imperative fort king is a historical gem that should be accessible to all this site is significant not only in floridas history but to the history of the nation i have been working on advancing fort king through national historic landmark status towards

the gentleman from texas chairman barton and the gentleman from michigan ranking member dingell i do rise in opposition to the bill this bill is a missed opportunity to provide a secure energy future for america it is a bill packed with taxpayersubsidized goodies for energy companies it is a bill that will not reduce our dependence on foreign oil i am pleased about one part of the bill it no longer contains the liability waiver to the mtbe industry now perhaps communities with mtbepolluted groundwater will have a fighting chance to get it cleaned up by the people who made the mess i call on the mtbe industry to do the right thing now stop fighting in court and in congress own up to your responsibility by sitting down and working out cleanup plans with these affected communities unfortunately the rest of the bill is mostly bad news at a time of recordhigh energy prices the bill hands out tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies for the oil and gas coal and nuclear power industries already making record profits the bill also cuts states out of lng siting decisions giving power to the federal government which of course always knows what is best in addition the bill does precious little to make america more energy efficient or to reduce our dependence on foreign oil there is no effort to make our cars more energy efficient seventyfive percent of the oil we use every day goes right into our gas tanks this bill acts like it is okay that mileage on our autos has gone down in recent years there is no connection between that and todays record gas prices finally this bill calls for new offshore drilling under the guise of conducting a socalled inventory my friends on the other side will argue that this is just a 6tudy so we know what is out there mms already conducts surveys every 5 years on offshore resources we already know where the offshore oil and gas is in the central and western gulf where drilling is currently allowed and is under way so why the inventory putting it simply this is just a first step in opening up offshore areas now off limits to new drilling this means new drilling off states like florida north carolina and california

our friends on the other side of the aisle seem to want to have their cake and eat it too th6y want to blame the majority for the national debt and the rising costof federal spending but the only solution they seem to offer is more spending or more taxes increased spending or increased taxes how can either of those two solutions be the right prescription for getting our fiscal house in order there is no better example of the challenges we are facing than the need to secure our homeland and as you know in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on september 11 our administration and this congress responded in a bipartisan way to create a centralized agency to coordinate our nations homeland security efforts but creating an entirely new agency particularly following september 11 was no easy task at that time the organization of the department of homeland security marked the largest single agency opening in nearly four decades dating back on the creation of the department of energy it also required the reshuffling of 180 000 employees and the transfer of some 22 federal agencies from one area of government control to another a department of this size and scope certainly needs a sufficient level of funding to carry out its goals and objectives and initially 50 billion was set aside just for this purpose the overall fiscal year 2006 budget for the department of homeland security including noghomeland defense spending totaled 40 3 billion president bush requested in his fiscal year 2007 budget 42 7 billion an increase of 2 4 billion or 5 8 percent overall spending in

this bill to the floor without the support of the house judiciary committee on which i also sit and i want to especially thank subcommittee ranking member mel watt for working with us also a gentleman from north carolina and for agreeing to help us move this bill forward as you know as the gentleman from north carolina has said netting is simply the manner in which debts and credits are calculated between parties and it is a critically important tool to unravel complex financial transactions which have until now been denied to our nations financial institutions this is in spite of broadbased bipar7 tisan support in fact the origin of this legislation is grounded in the collapse of the infamous hedge fund long term capital management after which former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan implored congress to pass the netting provision netting was also supported by the former clinton and the current bush administrations the primary goal of our legislation is to minimize systemic risks in situations when the procedure for resolving a single insolvency could trigger other failures elsewhere in the market h r 5585 protects the rights of market participants to terminate complex financial agreements it also ensures that the federal government like private entity creditors will be able to enforce and net out qualified contracts with financial institutions during insolvency proceedings additionally this bill includes a fee increase provision in order to pay bankruptcy trustees i want to thank my good friend and colleague congressman watt for working us with at his rqquest this bill was modified in two respects and as a result of those modifications more debtors will be eligible for the fee waiver however the fundamental issue before to us today is support for netting provisions in the bankruptcy settlement of major market participants i encourage my colleagues to support this bill and i ask our colleagues in the senate to act on this before the end of the 109th congress this bill would codify commonsense business practices these provisions have a long bipartisan legislative history in congress which continues today it is a privilege to work with mr
