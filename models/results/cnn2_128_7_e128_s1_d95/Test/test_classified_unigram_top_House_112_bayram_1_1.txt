this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within

may or may not receive dr washington is going to ensure that you have a 1 200 increase in health care premiums if youre the average american family thats just what happened after the first year of

recycling and reduce improper coal ash disposal epa wants to ensure that coal ash reuse is preserved while guaranteeing that any disposal is done safely and effectively epas proposed rules received extensive public involvement including thousands of public comments and eight public hearings around the country the coal residuals and reuse management act is designed to deprive epa of the ability

crosssection of veterans obtain or retain meaningful employment foremost among the provisions of the vow act is title i of the original legislation that i was proud to introduce to help put our unemployed veterans back to work title i targets retraining assistance to 100 000 unemployed veterans of past wars by temporarily extending their eligibility for the montgomery gi bill the advantage of this approach is that we are providing a reasonably robust yet affordable benefit without creating a new program other provisions in this bill continue the comprehensive approach by mandating with a few exceptions that separating servicemembers participate in transition assistance program classes yet other provisions facilitate the alignment of state licensing and credentialing standards with the skills servicemembers learned during their military service to our country and strengthening the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act provisions the bill also incorporates a bill authored by the vice chairman of our committee my good friend gus bilirakis from florida to direct the va to collect data to determine the number of credit hours the degrees and the certificates earned by those attending courses under the gi bill most importantly the data collected will help us to learn how well the gi bill benefits are positioning veterans to get jobs in todays economy and

finally i should point out that the mandatory and discretionary costs of the bill before us today are fully covered and are compliant with the budget rules of this house according to cbo mandatory offsets are covered by extending at their present rate funding fees paid by veterans using their home loan guaranty benefit and by limiting pension payments to veterans receiving care in medicaidfunded nursing homes these are both offsets that the committee has used extensively in the past and most importantly in passing a fix to the post9 11 gi bill by a vote of 4240 in this house

wanted to come down here to speak to the authorizers the chairmen out there who are sending this legislation to the floor because what we have in this house is called the cutgo rule which says if you

that it has to be relevant to the underlying legislationor they cant cut any additional funds so what we had to do in the rules committee yesterday was reject amendment after amendment after amendment

a waiver to sell the existing stock of overthecounter epinephrine inhalers only last summer and because the committee was moving legislation at the time did the food and drug administration finally provide at least some sort of response albeit one that was entirely unsatisfactory under the rules known as the montreal protocol certain chemical propellants used in a number of medical and cosmetic devices were to be phased out over a number of years the chlorofluorocarbons cfc used in the epinephrine inhalers here is one of the ones that was one of those propellants one of the manufacturers of these overthecounter inhalers has worked on a replacement inhaler only to meet with stonewalling through the food and drug administration and requests for more studies into the device although the food and drug administration claims they are awaiting an application from the company the company counters that the food and drug administration once again continues to move the goalpost regardless of the fingerpointing mr speakerand there is much of it surrounding this issuethe fact remains that there is no viable alternative for the overthecounter purchase by an asthmatic suffering from an acute emergency attack weve heard that a company is about to market a device and indeed there is a device available without a prescription but its behind the counter in other words if the pharmacy is open but the pharmacist is not there you cannot purchase this device i know this firsthand because it happened to me one evening while we were home on one of the district work periods the new product uses a nebulizer rather than a propellant its a little more complicated in my experience its a little more difficult to use and less effective nevertheless it is available but the cost differential is significant when compared with the old overthecounter cfc propellant epinephrine inhaler the committee and the congress should be on the side of putting more available products into the hands of patients and allowing them to effectively manage their medical issues instead opponents of this legislation hide behind false claims of the safety and efficacy of epinephrine i would point out that ive been an asthmatic my entire life i have utilized rescue inhalers for a long time racemic epinephrine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in an overthecounter asthma inhaler has been around for 60 years there has not been a question of its safety and efficacy if so we know the fda has the power to remove a drug or device that they think is unsafe or not effective they have given their stamp of approval to racemic epinephrine again and again over the last 60 years there continue to be dozens of epinephrinebased treatments for asthmarelated issues that are used by doctors and medical professionals although opponents of this legislation will claim that theyre opposed to the bill because epinephrine is not safe this claim is simply not true there are currently over 1 million units of these inhalers sitting in a warehouse in california not helping patients currently suffering from an asthma attack not available for a rescue treatment for someone who cannot get their breath its unconscionable to allow them to sit and gather dust when they could be used to provide relief to americas asthmatic patients moreover the company is committed to donating any proceeds from the sale to charity to remove any possible profit motive from their request to sell these products this is not about allowing a company to continue to sell their product its about not allowing a regulatory agency to unreasonably restrict the access of americas asthmatics to a useful product i wish more companies would come forward with a viable overthecounter asthma inhaler so that asthmatics could have more and more choices instead of that costly emergency room visit at 2 this bill is about allowing asthmatics to continue to get relief during an asthma attack to continue to have an emergency rescue inhaler available when they deem that they need it not when the administrator of the epa says they need it or not when the administrator of the fda says they need it members of congress spend a lot of time talking about how much they care about the plight of patientsand asthmatics in particularand decrying the high cost of health care even if it is just for a limited time this bill returns a safe

about the peace corps is that you get a lot more out of it than you really give youre serving other people but youre learning youre learning about another culture and at the same time youre learning about your own country and your own experiences because of the points of contrast what a wonderful thing it is that america has now tens of thousands of people who have served in the peace corps who have returned and who now are working in every walk of lifeworking in international organizations working in business organizations knowing different cultures knowing different languagesthereby

remember the quizzical but interested reaction that so many people in somalia or im sure anywhere in the world had who are you why are you doing it explain that to me again the spirit was kind of catching and they would participate in all kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps volunteers are not representatives of the american government they are representatives of the american people that was always emphasized very very strongly to all of us as part of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these diplomatic bunkers that we sometimes see in the world today youre experiencing life in the country in which youre serving one thing just as an example

couldnt be paid for doing this sort of thing but they might have gotten a couple of free meals from the restaurant and that kind of thing what a wonderful sort of natural way of building bridges the

of the cancer drug doxil which was in shortage and at the same time the fda prioritized the review of a new manufacturer of the same drug when the cancer drug went into shortage so what our bill will
