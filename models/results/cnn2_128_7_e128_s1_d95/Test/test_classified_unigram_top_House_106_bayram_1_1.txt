year 2000 to a close by implementing a bipartisan compromise on the remaining appropriations bills district of columbia interior commercejusticestate foreign operations and education labor health and human services only three times in the last two decades has the congress passed all 13 appropriations bills by the fiscal deadline i point out one was recently when the gentleman from wisconsin was chairman it is true that we did not make this deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through programs like goals 2000 the commerce justice state section of the conference report maintains our commitment to enhancing local law enforcement without involving washington bureaucrats we also provide funding for 1 000 new border patrol agents funds for increased criminal and illegal alien detention and the resources necessary to end the severe naturalization backlog at the ins the district of columbia continues to receive the high level of funding provided in each round of this process the conference report paves the way for dramatic improvement in the education of washingtons children the safety of our streets and the management of our nations capital h r 3194 also brokers a responsible compromise on the environment in the interior appropriations section of this conference report republicans rejected attempts to impose the restrictions of the kyoto global warming regime on americans without senate consideration of the treaty nevertheless the bill maintains our high environmental standards and ensures our air and water will be cleaned into the next millennium while i will permit the chairman of the committee on appropriations to describe fully all the contents of the appropriations bill i did want to note the inclusion of the satellite copyright legislation about which many of our constituents have expressed concerns during the past year i am pleased that this bill will provide a new copyright license to satellite television that will allow constituents to receive their local television channels over their satellite service in addition this bill will bring real competition ensure better prices and choices for our constituents protect existing subscribers from having their distant network service shut off and make it easier for consumers to get either a waiver or an eligibility test for distant network service in the event the waiver request is denied this bill is good for our constituents and i am pleased to support it

before the election trashing al gore why were not they bringing this forward last year let me remind my colleagues this story broke october 13 of this year in the new york times prior to october 13 none of us knew that vice president gore had worked out a secret deal in 1995 that madeleine albright referred to in a january 2000 memo this year prior to october 13 none of us knew this well that is only 2 weeks ago 2 weeks ago thank goodness we have a free press two weeks ago the new york times ran a copy of this document that i have now put in the congressional record that our members of congress were not aware of that no member of the intelligence committee no member of the leadership was asked to see by the vice president when he cut the deal in 1995 we were not made aware of this until we read the story in the new york times along with the rest of america on october 13 and then the washington times reported the story after that and other media it has not been picked up by the tv media and that is a legitimate question why has it not been now why is this so outrageous madam speaker why because this technology that has been transferred is used to improve the accuracy of systems against america and our allies is this isolated let me give you two examples i was in moscow in january of 1996 the washington post had just run a front page story with the headline america has caught the russians illegally transferring guidance systems to iraq i was in moscow i went to our embassy and i asked for a meeting with our ambassador who at that time was tom pickering he is now the number three person in the state department i said mr ambassador what was the response of the russians when you asked them about the transfer of the accelerometers and gyroscopes to iraq he said congressman weldon i have not asked the russians yet i said mr ambassador you are our representatives here why would you not ask the russians it was a front page story back home it is a violation of an arms control treaty the missile technology control regime he said that has to come from the white house so i came back to washington and i wrote the president a letter in the end of january 1996 dear mr president you must have read the story in the washington post what are you going to do about it if this occurred it is a serious violation because it gives iraq a capability that they cannot build on their own the president wrote me a response in march of that year dear congressman weldon you are correct if this transfer took place it would be a serious violation of the missile technology control regime and there are required sanctions in that treaty and i assure you if we can prove it we will impose the sanctions but congressman weldon we have no proof that this transfer took place well as i have done in speeches around the country i bring the proof for the american people to see this is a sovietmade gyroscope and a sovietmade accelerometer i cannot tell you where igot these devices but i can say they were clipped off of an ssn19 soviet missile that used to be aimed at an american city we caught the russians transferring these devices not once not twice but at least three times the american government has over 100 sets of these devices today we never imposed the sanctions required by the treaty yet we have the proof we have the evidence now what would iraq use these devices for they would use them to improve the accuracy of the same missile that killed those 28 young americans in 1991 who came home from desert storm in body bags because their country let them down because we could not defend against a low complexity scud missile these devices iraq cannot build they have to buy them and the only place to get them is from russia we caught them it is a violation of an arms control treaty the president told me if we could prove it he would take action we have the evidence and we never took any action in fact the logical question is why would we not take action against russia if we know they were deliberately violating a treaty and the answer is rather simple our policy for the past 8 years toward russia has been based on personal friendships the personal friendship of president clinton with the leader of russia boris yeltsin and the personal friendship between al gore and viktor"], [0.0004490062710829079, 0.0004490062710829079, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman from ohio my good friend and the gentleman from massachusetts for the opportunity to address this house i rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us

represent a congressional district that is not near a large urban center the largest city in my district roanoke has a population of slightly more than 100 000 people however folks in cities as large as roanoke virginia honolulu hawaii and springfield missouri are unlikely to benefit from the most important parts of legislation enacted last fall known as the satellite home viewer act this legislation which i served as a conferee on with many of my colleagues here today was designed to address a problem experienced by thousands of americans who are frustrated that they either could not receive their local network signal or had to receive a poor quality local network signal through a rooftop antenna rather than receive a network signal through their satellite provider the bill addressed this by allowing direct broadcast satellite providers to immediately begin retransmitting local television broadcast signals into the broadcast stations area consumers across the country expressed their support for this legislation and the availability of localintolocal technology i know my office received thousands of letters and calls from constituents concerned about this issue this new law allows satellite providers to become more effective competitors to cable operators who have been able to provide local overtheair broadcast stations to their subscribers for years it will also benefit american consumers in markets where local tv via satellite is made available by offering them full service digital television at an affordable price more importantly these consumers will benefit from local news weather reports information such as natural disasters or community emergencies local sports politics and election information as well as other information that is vital to the integrity of communities across the country local tv via satellite is already available to satellite subscribers in americas 20 largest television markets in these markets directv and echostar the existing satellite platform providers have begun retransmission of affiliates of the abc cbs nbc and fox broadcast networks directv and echostar have also announced their intention to begin retransmission of local tv stations in an additional 20 or 30 television markets over the next 24 months ultimately the two existing satellite platform providers will provide local tv via satellite to households in most if not all of the 50 largest television markets in the united states however there are 211 television markets in the united states and in excess of 100 million unitedstates tv households as this chart illustrates the red dots indicate h2290 co cities that have been served effective january 31 of this year and the yellow dots are announced or probable cities the rest of the country including 161 television markets is not going to be served by the legislation we passed last fall therefore if matters are left solely to the initiative of the existing satellite platform providers more than 50 percent of existing satellite subscribers over 6 million households will continue to be deprived of their local tv stations more than 60 percent of existing commercial television stations over 1 000 will not be available via satellite and more than 30 million unitedstates tv households will remain beyond the reach of local tv via satellite put another way local tv via satellite will not be available in 27 states so while the law enacted last fall has eliminated the legal barriers to delivery of local tv via satellite it alone will not assure delivery of local tv via satellite to the majority of local tv stations and satellite subscribers for that reason i have joined with my colleagues in the house to introduce legislation that will assure that all americans not just those in the most profitable urban markets did receive their local tv signals in a way that provides local information in a competitive environment for consumers this legislation represents a hardfought compromise between versions reported by the house agriculture and house commerce committees i want to express my appreciation to members of both committees for their willingness to work together to reach this agreement the substitute authorizes the administrator of the rural utilities service with the approval of the national telecommunications and information administration to administer loan guarantees not exceeding 1 25 billion for providing local broadcast tv signals in unserved and underserved markets the loan guarantees will be approved by a board consisting of the secretaries of agriculture commerce and treasury the loan guarantee may not exceed 80 percent of a loan and the board may not approve a loan guarantee for a project that is designed to serve primarily one or more of the top 40 markets the substitute also includes restrictions on which lending institutions can qualify for loan guarantees under this compromise the board should give priority consideration first to unserved areas then to underserved areas unserved areas are defined as areas outside grade b where there is no access to local signals from a forprofit multichannel video provider underserved areas are defined as those areas outside grade a where there is no morethan one forprofit multichannel video provider in addition the compromise requires that the value of collateral provided by the applicant must be at least equal to the unpaid balance of the loan amount covered by the loan guarantee the loan guarantee may not be used for the acquisition of spectrum and funds cannot be used by incumbent cable companies in their own franchise territories in addition under the compromise the system providing local signals shall not be required to carry in a market a greater number of local broadcast signals than the number of such signals that is carried by the cable system serving the largest number of subscribers in that market this is different than the version of the legislation that i introduced which applied full mustcarry rules to the program legislation similar to this bill was sponsored by senators gramm and burns and passed the senate on march 30 by a vote of 970 i want to particularly thank senator gramm and senator burns for their help senator burns represents the state of montana a rural area that is vitally impacted by this legislation and hq is to be commended for his leadership in the senate as is senator gramm for his leadership in getting this legislation passed through the united states senate the bill is crucial for americans in rural and smaller markets who rely on their local television stations for news politics weather sports and emergency information local television is often the only lifeline folks have in cases of natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes blizzards earthquakes or flooding the bills language to encourage the delivery of local television signals to these constituents in america will not only benefit consumers it will save lives in closing i want to thank several individuals here most importantly my colleague from my adjoining district in virginia whose leadership both in the conference

the water resources development act more commonly known as wrda is a critically important vehicle for environmental restoration projects this years bill is particularly noteworthy because it includes a plan to restore the nations everglades in florida this restoration effort is the largest most comprehensive restoration program ever attempted not too long ago most folks would have predicted it would be impossible to craft a restoration plan that gets it right and also wins the support of every major stakeholder involved in the everglades but that is exactly what this congress has done it is precisely the model for how we should deal with all of our environmental issues we drop the posturing we quit using the trite catch phrases we bring people together and we actually sit down at the table and rationally discuss the issues and work in good faith for the greater good based on sciencebased principles i am not entirely naive and i understand that the reason it worked with the everglades is that the parties realized that this was too important to let go further amuck but this precisely is my point all environmental issues are important and should deserve the same attention and the same approach we should not sacrifice the environment anywhere for shortterm gain i hope that the folks out there who make a living doing so will learn the lesson of the everglades folks on the other side of the aisle talk a lot about a donothing congress i note that president clinton asserted recently that this has been one of the most productive sessions ever which i think is a real tribute to our speaker the gentleman from illinois frankly a direct disavowal of the statements of the gentleman from missouri minority leader that we are a donothing congress but todays action is yet another in a very very long list of examples that prove the republican congress delivers on americans priorities the challenge this congress faced was to craft the plan that truly improves the hydrology and the hydroperiods and restores the unique natural environment of the everglades along with the other partners involved the state of florida and the interests that are involved in the areas of the everglades the costs of doing nothing were far too great the magnificent everglades have suffered through years of neglect and misunderstanding doing nothing would have ensured disaster disaster incidentally had begun spreading to florida bay and even to the nearby coral reefs which are unique in themselves even so as is often the case the impulse to do something can often lead to unintended consequences so technically we faced an incredible challenge as daunting as the engineering problems are even more so is the challenge of getting various stakeholders who often would not even speak to each other to find common ground that is the snapshot of the immense challenge that we faced at the beginning of this process well here we are with a conference report a final agreement so it bears asking how we have tackled what florida governor jeb bush has now termed perhaps the defining environmental issue of this new century i think it is the defining issue the everglades bill is simply at the top of a very long list of environmental achievement for this congress a lot of folks deserve our thanks for getting us here the state of florida and governor jeb bush have demonstrated an unmistakable commitment to this effort and led at every point in the process the clinton administration also deserves our praise in terms of steering the proposal through congress our two senators deserve an inordinate amount of praise and recognition in the house the entire delegation supported the effort but the house efforts were kept on track by the patience perseverance and

we do have a difference in opinion on how to eradicate drug smuggling and drug abuse the district i represent sits on the mexican border one of the crossings in my district is the busiest border crossing in the entire world so i have personal experience with the border and all the opportunities and challenges associated with border crossings there is no question that we must gain better control of our borders there have been herculean efforts by the immigration and naturalization service the customs service the drug enforcement agency the federal bureau of investigation and many other government agencies including state and local agencies all these agencies are to be commended for their efforts and dedication to controlling our borders and ending the illegal crossing of narcotics and narcotics smugglers and though much remains to be done i have serious and grave reservations about this proposal to literally arm the border yes we need to better control the border but placing armed military personnel on our borders who are trained to fight and win wars by killing people is not the answer the united states military is the best equipped best trained most disciplined and most efficient in the world our military can win any war that the american people choose to fight but the brave men and women serving in our armed forces win those wars by killing people as repulsive and unforgiving as killing is it is the way wars are won with people who are trained to kill other people patrolling our own border i fear for the safety of our own citizensnot from intent but from accident i also want to remind everyone that mexico is a friendly country they have made no attempts at invasion since the alamo accordingly i believe this proposal could do serious damage to a relationship that is fragile at best we must find new and innovative methods for stopping illegal drugs from coming into our country and killing our people but i do not believe arming the mexicanamerican border with the united states military is the best way i call on my colleagues to not limit themselves to old and easy ideas for ending this scourge of deadly drugs let us think beyond

you got diarrhea you drank that junk that pink junk you drank it you drank a whole thing of it to try to get rid of the diarrhea today you buy a little packet about this big with little pills you pop one pill and that is it our country is the country that makes advancements we have got to do something about these outrageous prices that have snuck in here for example i do not know why the democrat from new jersey instead of up here bashing and misleading all of you by saying that the republicans the leadership have planned this cruel hoax on the americans really honestly is there anybody you have ever met in elective office that wants to go out and play a cruel hoax on the constituents they represent is that an exaggeration of course it is an exaggeration but the fact that we come back to is this what do we do to bring the pharmaceutical prices into line without bringing in nationalized health care the democrats are very easy to stand up here in front of you ladies and gentlemen and stand in front of my colleagues and promise you the moon the magic cure greener fields on the other side of the fence all i am saying is before you jump on the other side of the fence take a look at the consequences of the plan that they are proposing where do you think al gore the vice president is going to get his money from this it comes out of that surplus remember this is the first time in 30 years we have had that surplus as i say clearly there is a problem out there we need to address that problem but the gore approach and the democratic congress approach or at least the liberal side of it i have got to say i have got to restrain myself because we have several conservative democrats who do not agree with the liberal approach as just espoused by the gentleman from new jersey but the liberal democratic approach is the hillary clinton approach nationalized health care socialized health care i can tell a lot of you right now 64 percent of the people in america as i understand have some kind of prescription care service you better figure out what the gentleman from new jersey is proposing to do with the service of those of you that have prescription care in moving that to the people that do not have prescription care service there are lots of consequences to what the democrats the liberal democrats are proposing when they offer you something for nothing there is a price to be paid and i think it is incumbent upon the gentleman from new jersey and his colleagues when they stand up here and trash and cut down more conservative democrats or the conservative republicans i think it is incumbent on them to kind of have an openness requirement tell the people what the consequences are of nationalized health care tell people what the consequences are of a canadiantype of system talk about it tell the people what the consequences are of research for better medicines know this is why this congress just does not jump up and sign the blank check offered by the gentleman fromnew jersey we are not going to jump up and sign a blank check at least enough of us on both sides of the aisle are saying wait a minute what are we doing what are the consequences clearly we all agree on the problem despite what the gentleman from new jersey says nobody is patting the pharmaceutical companies on the back and saying be proud of yourself they have not done a good job in some regards with medicine but frankly it appears that there is some gouging going on out there but before my colleagues addressthat problem take a very careful look at what the democrat the liberal democrat approach is because i can assure my colleagues in the long run first of all they promise it will only be 10 percent of the surplus and a much much smaller percent of the budget and nothing will grow and grow and grow and it is the open door for socialized medicine in this country for a national health care and there are a lot of people who in my opinion will suffer under a national health care plan nobody should be forgotten and nobody should be left behind but there are ways to address that without going into a hillary clintontype of health care plan so my discussion here tonight was not intended to be on health care but there is nobody else that stands here to rebut these gentlemen as they speak here unrebutted for 1 hour about the socalled quote cruel hoaxes by the republican leadership those words ought to be stricken from the record they are inaccurate they are misleading the gentleman from new jersey and some of his colleagues they know that the cruel hoax by the leadership i did not say there is a cruel hoax by the democratic leadership come on we have more protocol on this floor we can be more ladies and gentlemen in talking about the problem the people that suffer while this partisan bickering goes on back here are the senior citizens that do not have prescription care or by the way anybody that does not have the ability to care for themselves but do not address it by waving the magic wand and saying look citizens we have got something for nothing we are going to take care of all of your health care needs we are going to take away your personal responsibility and the government is going to assume it remember every time and i cannot say this strong enough every time the government assumes one of your responsibilities every time the government takes a burden of yours and makes it a burden of theirs they take something with it it comes with a price somewhere we are losing a freedom somewhere we are going to lose the ability to have choice in the future so in summary on this health care plan let me say i am discouraged by the comments that were made previous to my speaking here this evening we do not get anywhere and i direct my remarks at the liberal democrats look we are not going to get anywhere with a nationalized health care plan we are not going to get anywhere with socialized medicine why do you not sit down instead of talking about how leadership has this cruel conspiracy going on by throwing a few bucks at insurance companies why do you not put the electionyear rhetoric aside and sit down with us and help us try and figure out what a solution is every day that we use that kind of rhetoric there are people out there who are suffering because my colleagues are not willing to sit down and put their heads together to come up with a solution and there is a solution i am optimistic that we can have a solution we do have a great country and we have made wonderful strides in health care but clearly we have got some problems in that system but we can fix it without having our health care provided by the united states of america which means they are going to oversee what doctors you see they are going to oversee what kind of prescriptions you get they are going to oversee what kind of treatments you get they are going to oversee how often you are going to get to see this doctor or that doctor socialized or national medicine is not the magic answer it appears to be tonight it is very easy to buy into this very easy to buy into this because the democrats the liberal side over here not all democrats i stand corrected the liberal democrats over here they think you are going to get something for nothing and they are saying look it is easy for us to afford it no problem remember you do not get something for nothing let me switch subjects and talk about something much much more pertinent i think really because of the olympics i hope some of you have are having the opportunity to watch it in fact i was over at the office before i came over this evening watching the olympics how exciting that is even if it is taped nbc or whoever does that the reality of it is look what we get to see clear across the ocean in sydney and watch those olympics and i am very proud of those people i want to tell you i heard an advertisement i will not tell you the name of the company the other day but i heard an advertisement about the olympics and it said our young men and women that go over there to compete in the olympics they will come home heroes and i thought to myself you know they will come over celebrities i would like to have their autographs i am proud of them but i think using the word heroes is somewhat of a delusion i think the real word of heroes is used in a different type of setting there are sports celebrities and there are heroes i have a perfect example i am not just up here talking without giving you an example it is happening this week in pueblo colorado first of all on my way over i real quickly grabbed a dictionary and i looked up the word hero hero a mythological or a legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability an illustrious warrior a man admired for his noble qualities one that shows great courage an object of extreme admiration and devotion with courage with that said let me read an editorial from one of the leading newspapers in the state of colorado the pueblo chieftain it is called patriots week what is patriots week about this is a celebration of heroes this week we anticipate more than 110 americans more than 110 americans who have been decorated with the medal of honor which is the highest honor our country can give out 110 bf them will be in pueblo colorado to be honored by a city which was recently designated as one of the four finest communities to live in this country pueblo colorado picked out of hundreds of communities it was picked in the top four this week pueblo is hosting 110 medal of honor winners and they are calling their week patriots week i am going to go through my poster here in a few minutes with you and show you some of the interesting things about what this week is going to consist of first of all let me read the editorial out of the sunday chieftain star and journal my good friend bob rawlings who is the publisher and editor this is patriots week the home of heroes in pueblo colorado on tuesday the national medal of honor society convenes here for its annual convention pueblo is home to four medal of honor recipients the most of any city at least in modern times on thursday largerthanlife bronze sculptures of the four puebloans who won this will be unveiled at the pueblo convention center they are carl sitter william crawford drew dix and jerry murphy mr sitter and mr crawford died this year but not before they got to see their sculptures taking form also included is a display of all medal of honor recipients dating back to the civil war when the nations highest honor was approved by the united states congress a black tie patriot dinner on friday will bring five greats from the world of sports to pueblo golfer arnold palmer gold glove baseball player brooks robinson nba center david the admiral robinson onetime boxing champion gene fullmer and the nhl hockey star pat lafontaine will receive the societys patriot award for the joy and support they have given to our military forces also commentator paul harvey and world war ii cartoonist bill maudlin will receive special awards from the medal of honor society two other veterans organizations are in pueblo this in week in conjunction with the societys convention two days ago the 50th anniversary reunion of the 578th combat engineering battalion began later this year the crew of the peachy a b29 piloted by puebloan bill haver that flew raids over japan will meet for its annual gettogether mr haver named the plane a replica of which is at the aircraft museum at the memorial airport in honor of his sister peachy wilcoxson and i know peachy today is constitution day all of these patriots spot for the ideals embodied in the united states constitution and many of their comrades perished in that effort so let each and every one of us reflect on that remarkable document and rededicate ourselves to the cause of liberty and justice well how exciting in pueblo alone for example i would like to just to kind of for a moment go over who are the four members who are from pueblo colorado as i mentioned in my comments unfortunately two of our members two of our citizens of pueblo passed away earlier this year mr crawford who was in the army you can see right here and mr sitter right here but we still have surviving drew dix the gentleman right here with the red dot and jerry murphy who was in the marines in korea this is the plaza that pueblo colorado has dedicated and put together through contributions from the local community here is a community that came together did not come to the united states congress and ask for money did not expect the government to do it they got together in their community of pueblo colorado to honor all medal of honor recipients but specifically to put something that will be a longlasting recognition of the four medal of honor winners from pueblo colorado that is what that little plaza is going to look like the statues here is one of jerry murphy 82 feet tall that is the completed statute there honoring jerry here so you have an idea there is bill crawford before he passed away as he stands with the statue of him which is also about 81 2 feet high this is going to be an exciting week in pueblo what i thought i would do is share with my colleagues four of the stories of these medal of honor winners i can tell you that i have had the occasion and i consider it amongst the highest privileges of my congressional career if i were to kind of recapture my memories of serving in the united states congress where i felt the most fortunate to meet somebody or the most privileged to be able to shake their hand i would have to put it in the order of i am catholic the pope and mother theresa and right behind them our medal of honor winners in fact i was in a parade in pueblo not very long ago and i had the opportunity in that parade to shake the hands of two medal of honor winners who were watching the parade you feel so much pride because these people are such heroes they really are what heros are the word they do not cause any delusion to the word hero h7715 they embody hero in its fullest envisions let me talk about drew dix i will point out drew here drew right here by the way a special hello to his mother a very sweet person in pueblo colorado let me talk a little about drew drew d dix unitedstates army special forces vietnam citation for conspicuous gallantry in the action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty sergeant dix distinguished himself by exceptional heroism by serving as a unit advisor to heavily armed vietcong battalions attacked the providence capital of chau phu resulting in complete breakdown and fragmentation of defenses of the city sergeant dix with a patrol of vietnamese soldiers was recalled to assist in the defense of the city learning that a nurse was trapped in a house near the center of the city sergeant dix organized a relief force successfully rescued the nurse and returned her safely to the tackle operations ceiter but that is not all being informed that now there were other trapped civilians within the city sergeant dix voluntarily led another force to rescue eight civilian employees located in a building which was under heavy mortar and small arms fire sergeant dix then returned to the center of the city upon approaching a building he was subjected to intense automatic rifle and machine gun fire from an unknown number of vietcong he personally assaulted the building killing six of the vietcong and rescuing two philippinos the following day sergeant dix still onhis own volition assembled a 20man force and though under intense enemy fire cleared the vietcong out of the hotel the theater and other adjacent buildings within the city during this portion of the attack army republic of vietnam soldiers inspired by the heroism and success of sergeant dix rallied and commenced firing upon the viet cong sergeant dix individually captured 20 prisoners including a high ranking viet cong official he then attacked enemy troops who had entered the residence of the deputy providence chief and was successful in rescuing the officials wife and children sergeant dixs personal heroic actions resulted in 14 confirmed viet cong killed in action and possibly 25 more the capture of 20 prisoners 15 weapons and the rescue of 14 united states and free world civilians the heroism of sergeant dix was in the highest tradition and reflects great credit upon the united states army raymond jerry murphy and if you ever go to pueblo colorado you will see murphy boulevard i mean these guys are real heroes their community loves them our country has deep respect for medal of honor winners excuse me not winners they did not win it medal of honor recipients and i stand corrected on that raymond jerry murphy united states marine corps korea citation for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a platoon commander of company a an action against enemy aggressor forces although painfully wounded by fragments froman enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and wellentrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground second lieutenant murphy steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small arms fire skillfully maneuvering his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement undeterred by the increasing intense enemy fire he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded personally carrying many of the stricken marines to safety when reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements second lieutenant murphy employed part of his unit as support and during the ensuing battle personally killed two of the enemy with his own pistol with all of the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces of the hill and although suffering intense pain from his previous wounds he seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared from the trenches after reaching the base of the hill he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing marines locating and carrying the bodies of machine gun crew back down the hill wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small arms artillery and mortar fire he again refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men including all of the casualties had preceded him to the main lines his resolute and inspiring leadership and exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon second lieutenant murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the united states marine corps william crawford our third pueblo citizen united states army world war ii for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of life and above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy in italy 13 september 1943 whencompany i attacked an enemyheld position on hill 424 the third platoon in which private crawford was a squad scout attacked as a base platoon for the company after reaching the crest of the hill the platoon was pinned down by intense enemy machine and small arms fire locating one of these guns which was dug in on a terrace on his immediate front private crawford without orders and on his own initiative moved over the hill under enemy fire to a point within a few yards of the machine gun emplacement and singlehandedly destroyed the machine gun and killed three of the crew with a hand grenade thus enabling his platoon to continue its advance when the platoon after reaching the crest was once more delayed by enemy fire private crawford again in face of intense fire and on his own volition advanced directly to the front midway between two hostile two this time hostile machine gun nests located on a higher terrace and placed in a small ravine moving first to the left with a hand grenade he destroyed one gun emplacement and killed the crew then he worked his way to the right and under continuous fire from the other machine gun emplacement he used one hand grenade and the use of his rifle and he killed one enemy and blew out the machine gun nest and forced the remainder of the enemy to flee seizing the enemy machine gun that was left from the one emplacement he fired on the withdrawing germans and facilitating his companys advance these are remarkable individuals carl sitter united states marine corps korea for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a commanding officer of company g in action against enemy aggressor forces ordered to break through enemy infested territory to reinforce his battalion the morning of 29 november captain sitter continuously exposed himself to enemy fire as he led his company forward and despite 25 percent casualties suffered in the furious action he succeeded in driving the group to its objective assuming the responsibility of attempting to seize and occupy a strategic area occupied by a hostile force of regiment strength deeply entrenched on a snow covered hill commanding the entire valley southeast of town as well as the line of march of friendly troops withdrawing to the south he reorganized his depleted units the following morning and boldly led them up that steep frozen hillside under blistering fire encouraging and redeploying his troops as casualties occurred and directing forward platoons as they continued the drive to the top of the ridge during the night when the vastly outnumbered enemy launched a sudden vicious counterattack setting the hill ablaze with mortar machinegun and automatic weapons fire and taking a heavy toll in troops captain sitter visited each foxhole and gun position coolly deploying and integrating reinforcing units consisting of service personnel unfamiliar with infantry tactics into a coordinated combat team and instilling in every man the will and determination to hold his position at all costs with the enemy penetrating his lines in repeated counterattacks which often required handtohand combat and on one occasion infiltrating to the command post with hand grenades he fought gallantly with his men in repulsing and killing the fanatic attackers in each encounter painfully wounded in the face wounded in the arms and wounded in the chest by bursting grenades he staunchly refused to be evacuated and he continued to fight on until a successful defense of the area was assured with a loss of the enemy by more than 50 percent of their troops dead or wounded or captured his valiant leadership superb tactics and great personal valor throughout 36 hours of bitter combat reflect the highest credit upon captain sitter and the unitedstates naval service these four gentlemen that i just described as heroes who got the medal of honor are from pueblo colorado but i want to remind all of my colleagues there is what we call the medal of honor society and 110 members of that society will be in pueblo colorado this week to be honored by our community and to be honored by our nation for what they have done those four stories i told are but a drop in the bucket of the stories of valor the stories of courageous brave men and women who stepped out above the call of duty because they believed in america they believed in freedom and they were willing to lay their life down for it this weekend i had a wonderful opportunity to spend with my wife and my parents in meeker colorado and we were up at the cemetery an old cemetery we were in the old section of the cemetery and i walked by a grave and it was a young man not much on the gravestone had the gentlemens name had his birth he was 22 years old and all it said on the gravestone was he died for his country as we know we have thousands and thousands and thousands of men and women in this country who have died for their country and we have hundreds of thousands of men and women who have fought bravely for what this country stands for for the freedom of this country for the benefit of all of us we cannot acknowledge everybody with a medal of honor so we know that there are brave and courageous individuals out there who should have received the medal of honor who earned the medal of honor but did not receive it but we do know we still have a group of individuals who did receive the medal of honor and they truly should own lock stock and barrel the title of hero"], [0.0030761659145355225, 0.4969238340854645, 0, "i appreciate the gentleman yielding very much and especially on this very timely topic as we have this discussion tomorrow on get getting rid of the federal death tax this very punitive tax i know the gentleman has been talking about a recent editorial in fact i think in todays wall street journal i am mindful of an editorial that was written in yesterdays washington post in a similar vein that indicates that what we are about to do tomorrow is government by bumper sticker as the editorial says i suspect that we are going to have during the course of this debate that mantra from those who oppose this idea that this is tax breaks for the wealthy and yet speaking of bumper stickers the gentleman has been talking about friends near and dear to him back home in colorado but over the memorial day recess i had the opportunity to travel the highways of missouris 9th congressional district and i got behind this minivan vehicle that was pulling a camper trailer behind it and the bumper sticker on the camper trailer said im spending my kids inheritance and of course this is kind of a whimsical thought and first i had to make sure that was not my family that was traveling down the highway spending their kids inheritance i think it points up really a more serious issue and that is it really in some cases and my colleague pointed out some very reallife examples in some cases it is cheaper to sell off the family business predeath rather than to experience first of all the personal tragedy of the loss of a loved one but then having to deal with the internal revenue service at the moment of death the best bumper sticker slogan that i can think of regarding this issue is as follows the death of a family member should not be a taxable event the point is and i know that the editorials talk about and my colleague has spoken very eloquently and very passionately about the opponents of this repeal say well this is only going to help as you my colleague mentioned the bill gateses or the wealthy class but the wealthiest americans i think what gets lost in all of the debate is how many resources how much money is spent how much time and effort is spent in a way to avoid the death tax there is not a lot of discussion about the amount of again resources committed to estate plans now i have got many friends that are tax lawyers or accountants but speaking of a reallife example back home in columbia missouri which is my home a family the eiffert family howard eiffert started a lumber business along with his wife lucy and they worked very hard during the course of their lifetimes and their two sons brad and greg who now are the principals in that lumber business and it has been successful people around the midmissouri area recognize this lumber company howard is now enjoying retirement and he is becoming more seasoned as a mature american and yet the amount of money that the eiffert family particularly the two principals are spending 35 000 a year on insurance premiums and the sole purpose of purchasing that insurance policy is to have something in place so that when the inevitable mortality occurs that they will have proceeds from which they cail then pay the federal death tax that is 35 000 a year of capital that they could be investing in their business investing in their families putting aside money for a college education whatever letting them have that decision but instead they are making the choice to put 35 grand a year in an insurance policy because they know that as they have done their estate planning that they are going to be socked with the federal death

unfortunate that she wishes to hold up this bill which is so necessary for small businesses in the mistaken attempt of turning this into somehow some gun control bill the fact is her claim that some of these lawsuits or all of these lawsuits would be thrown out of court simply misses the mark as i indicated in my opening statement this bill would do nothing to preclude a claimant from obtaining economic damages which include wages medical expenses and business loss it h468 co would do nothing to preclude a claimant from receiving noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering disfigurement

happy to see that this legislation has some of his work included i rise in strong support of this legislation this package provides much needed relief to small businesses that combined with an increase in the minimum wage is a winwin situation for workers and entrylevel positions who are trying to work their way into the mainstream of our strong economy i have been a longtime supporter of raising the minimum wage and this 1 increase that we have proposed is the equivalent of a 20 percent raise over 3 years that sends a strong positive message to working seniors firsttime workers and those striving to work their way out of the welfare system combined with that minimum wage increase this legislation provides muchneeded tax relief that will assist small businesses and their workers for example it enhances the retirement security of all americans by increasing pension portability allowing workers over 50 to catch up on contributions and increasing the contribution and benefits limits in defined contribution and benefits plans it encourages job creation among small businesses through increasing the expense and writeoff for equipment an important progrowth initiative this legislation also reforms a section of the code that punishes people by artificially lowering the value of their pension through caps it also creates tax incentives to lure investment back into some of our most depressed communities so that they can share in our economic prosperity it expands incentive for the creation of affordable housing notwithstanding all of that we are hearing rhetoric on the
