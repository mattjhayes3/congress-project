hope people can make better decisions about what to do with guns i hope people stop fighting about whether we should do gun control because i worry more people and kids like tyshawn will be killed we

making sure that a prospective gun buyer isnt a terrorist a criminal a domestic abuser or dangerously mentally ill the supreme court made that perfectly clear in district of columbia v heller the court ruled that while americans have the right to keep and bear arms there are no constitutional problems with laws prohibiting felons and the dangerously mentally ill from carrying guns as a responsible gun owner myself i will never give up my guns and i will never ask lawabiding individuals without a history of dangerous mental illness to give up theirs and like other responsible gun owners i understand that if gun violence continues unabated then eventually we will see laws that place substantial and overly burdensome restrictions on our right to own guns to reduce gun violence we dont need to stop lawabiding citizens who use guns for hunting sport shooting and personal protection from obtaining those firearms we need to stop terrorists criminals domestic abusers and those with a history of dangerous mental illness from getting guns our first line of defense when it comes to making sure that guns dont fall into dangerous hands is to conduct a background check and we know that when used background checks work every day background checks stop more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun but sadly a gaping loophole allows those same felons dangerously mentally ill and domestic abusers to bypass a background check in 34 states all they have to do is go online or go to a gun show that is wrong that is dangerous and that loophole needs to be closed that is why it is long past time for the republican leadership to allow a vote on h r 1217 my bipartisan prosecond amendment bill to require a background check for all commercial gun sales the bill bolsters the second amendment rights of lawful gun owners by making sure that the bad guys cant easily bypass background checks when trying to buy a gun just as important

legally buy a firearm we should be able to agree that suspected terrorists shouldnt be able to legally buy a gun or guns of their choosing as a responsible gun owner i am fed up with those who are blindly opposed to background checks hiding behind bumper sticker slogans like guns dont kill people people kill people everyone knows that guns dont kill people which is exactly why responsible gun owners and the overwhelming majority of the american people understand that it is important to run a background check to see if the person buying the gun is a danger to our community this debate isnt a choice between respecting the second amendment or reducing gun violence as a responsible gun owner i am tired of it being framed that way it is about this congress doing both the supreme courts

000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our

lifted a finger to prevent it now this week after intense public criticism and a historic protest by democrats on the house floor republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms after all nearly 2 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country but rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other words the bill is totally inadequate now under pressure from their most extreme members republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor what should be on the floor is bipartisan legislation h r 1076 that would permit the attorney general to block gun sales to suspected terrorists this legislation based on a proposal from the bush justice department would still allow individuals to challenge the government in court to restore their gun ownership rights we dont have to choose between protecting our communities and respecting due process and so we ask our

options for consumers the national flood insurance program is an important tool that empowers and protects homeowners all across america the biggertwaters act of 2012 took an important step in opening up the market and allowing private flood insurance policies to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the program however as we have learned sometimes even the best laid plans can have unintended consequences with a lack of clarity as to which private flood insurance policies are allowed in the program the market has not been able to expand and consumers have been left with just one choice to insure their properties from flood risk the national flood insurance program i recently heard from one of my constituents in martin county florida about how the premium for just 1 year of flood insurance coverage through the nfip ended up being five times the price they expected it to be to make matters worse the maximum coverage was only half of what they paid for the home itself yet they were required to purchase the higher priced plan that did not provide the coverage they needed because there were no other options this highlights the urgent need to allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace to meet homeowners needs and drive down costs but to do that we must allow the states to license and regulate flood insurance policies exactly like homeowners insurance car insurance or health insurance yet almost inexplicably floridas private flood insurance market remains restrained because homeowners are not given the choice to look to private market policies for more flood insurance options the bank will not accept other policies because their regulators havent approved them this bill will solve this problem by allowing state insurance commissioners who have long been considered by congress as the most appropriate regulators of insurance to certify private insurance plans to provide equivalent or better protections for flood insurance other than the nfip plan

american economy both of which passed in the 113th congress with bipartisan support h r 30 the save american workers act is designed to address a critical flaw in the affordable care act which is causing workers to lose hours at their jobs and thus lose wagesthose wages that help put food on their tables those wages that help feed their families pay their utility bills heat their homes during the winter and cool their homes during the summer h r 30 fixes this flaw by changing the newly created labor rule in the affordable care act which defines fulltime work at 30 hours a week and places that definition back where the american public has believed it to be for the last 100 years that is at 40 hours the second bill contained in todays rule is h r 3 the keystone xl pipeline act and that would put an end to what has been a 6year process for approving a pipeline that should have simply been common sense for americas economy a long time ago the rule before us today provides for 1 hour of debate for each of the bills this allows the house to fully debate these crucial issues these bills are targeted pieces of legislation dealing with one single provision in the affordable care act and one single pipeline respectively no one is trying to repeal the affordable care act today for that stay tuned but i have no doubt that members of the minority will claim that this bill is an attempt to repeal the affordable care act but in fact it simply makes changes to a definition and interpretation by the department of labor in the bill as always the minority is also afforded the customary motion to recommit on each of the bills as a result of the affordable care acts requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees provide health insurance coverage to those employees working 30 hours per week employers across the nationfrom schools to universities to municipalities to restaurantsare being forced to cut workers hours or face unsustainable employment costs to their businesses and to their organizations as a result we are seeingand this is what republicans predicted prior to the controversial and contentious passage of the affordable care actbut what we are seeing is the bill has fundamentally changed labor law in this country creating a new standard 30hour workweek as a result workers hours are being cut and productivity in this countrya country that has always prided itself on the work ethic of its citizenswill decrease over time this is what onerous government regulations dosuppress innovation and hamper businesses many members of the democratic party have been outspoken in clamoring for an extension to longterm unemployment benefits which would extend government assistance to all unemployed americans well beyond a years worth of benefits yet there is something that can be done now there is something that can be done today which will have an actual practical effect of putting more money in more peoples pockets we have heard story after story from every state in the union that employers are dropping workers hours from less than 39 hours a week to perhaps less than 29 hours or fewerpotentially 10 work hours a week that workers wont see in their paychecks which could mean hundreds of dollars that men and women wont have to feed their families and pay their bills increasing workers hours increases money that people have to spend the affordable care act fundamentally changed labor law in this country and the repercussions of this may not be felt for years to come this is a dangerous slippery slope what other labor laws will be reinterpreted now to define fulltime employment as 30 hours per week do people intend to impose overtime rules on employers who employ people for over 30 hours per week this is yet another regulation which would only result in businesses cutting more hours what will the national labor relations board reinterpret knowing that the very fabric of labor law is now based on a 30hour workweek instead of the 100year standard of the 40hour workweek prior to the affordable care act employers were already overwhelmingly providing health insurance to their employees working 40 hours per week making the change contained in mr youngs legislation will cause the least amount of disruption to the labor market and that is an important thing the congressional budget office estimates that the affordable care act will reduce the total number of hours worked on net by about 1 5 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024 almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor because of this the congressional budget office projects a decline in the number of workers of about 2 million in 2017 rising to 2 5 million in 2024 as a result of the affordable care act the latest congressional budget office figures show that the affordable care act will increase spending by almost 2 trillion double the estimate from 5 years ago and the joint committee on taxation says that taxpayers will be on the hook for over another 1 trillion over the next decade americans earning as little as 25 000 annually will pay more because of the law even after accounting for the 1 trillion in premium

the most conservative estimates most conservative is more than 25 000 jobs so one penny 25 000 jobs but no we cant go there i proposed we index the existing gas tax to inflation no we cant do that all right didnt want to do that i proposed that we tax the fraction of a barrel of oil that goes into taxable transportation uses not manufacturing not agriculture not any of this other stuff that they

our balanced budget proposal gets to balance within a 10year period of time it does so without raising taxes and it increases growth now the growth is important and our friends mentioned it on the other side of the aisle as if the policies that have been in place over the past 6 years had some magical solution that they increased growth in this country well the fact of the matter is that as we see it in this chartthis is from the congressional budget office the nonpartisan congressional budget office as my friend from maryland says these are the projections of growth that the congressional budget office has had over the last 4 years four years ago 3 0 percent the average as you all well know is about 3 3 percent over the last 40 years growth in this country that is in the economy growing every year 3 3 percent on average and the projection 4 years ago was that it would be 3 percent three years ago it was down to 2 9 percent 2 years ago 2 5 percent this year 2 3 percent this is lost jobs lost opportunity fewer dreams realized all because of the policies coming out of washington d c and our friends on the other side want to double down on those policies our proposal our budget that gets to balancewhich our friends on the other side of the aisle and their budget never does the presidents budget never gets to balance something that folks back home cant do they cant do it in their personal lives they cant do it in their businesses our budget gets to balance and increases growthincreases growthbecause that is what we have got to do we have got to increase growth in this economy so that more dreams can be realized more jobs can be created wages can be increased the way you increase wages is to increase the vitality of the economy not have washington dictate it to people and then this tired old characterization of our proposal to save and strengthen and secure medicare and the way that it is characterized is to voucherize it well this is nonsense and the american people know it what we propose to do is to save medicare not allow it to die on the vine which is what our friends on the other side of the aisle apparently want to do because when you read their policies they dont do anything to address the insolvency of medicare that is coming in a very short period of timenot according to me but according to the medicare trusteesand what that means is that patients seniors wont be able to get provided the services that they have been promised that is not the right thing to do our friends on the other side talk about all the tax loopholes and goodness knows we have been for cutting tax loopholes and closing tax loopholes before closing tax loopholes was cool we just cant get out and get folks to rally to the cause in a positive way from our friends on the other side of the aisle my friend from maryland knows that the way that that is fashioned is in the ways and means committee it is not in the budget committee the budget committee lays out the vision lays out the plan lays out the parameters that are able to be utilized as my friend from maryland knows the ways and means committee is actively working right nowactively working right nowon appropriate tax reform it was the tax reform proposal that was put forward by our side of the aisle last year that demonstrated our willingness and desire to close loopholes and to end special treatments through the tax code we believe everybody ought to be treated equally in the tax code not have washington picking winners and losers which is what our friends on the other side tend to desire then again this distorted notion about healthcare costs and where healthcare costs are going right now healthcare costs are down that is right who are they down for they are down for the federal government who are they not down for the american people that is who they are not down for what we have done with the presidents healthcare program is to shift huge costshuge coststo the american people if you are an individual out there you make 30 000 40 000 50 000 right now and the coverage that you are able to purchase right nowbecause obamacare has a deduction has a deductible in
