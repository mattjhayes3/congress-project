crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague

president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.020668387413024902, 0.9793316125869751, 1,

majority of the house as constituted 56 and 44 is a fair majority now let us turn that around democracy in action let us go to the house rules committee the caucus of the democratic party mandated that the percentage would be 69 percent democrat and 31 percent republican my colleagues know what a steamroller is a steamroller is a piece of equipment that cannot be stopped and runs over

development when i look at the three departments and the agency in question today i see four federal entities each with unique responsibilities and special functions despite their unique status however they are like every other department and agency in the sense that they are vulnerable to fraud waste and mismanagement they need what was created in the 1978 act inspectors general who are responsible for conducting and supervising audits and investigations of agency activities providing leadership in promoting efficiency and effectiveness within the agency detecting and preventing fraud abuse and waste and informing the agency head and congress of problems and needed corrective actions the io concept is a sound workable concept that brings together the audit and investigative resources of an agency under a single official who reports directly to the head of the agency and to the congress that focal point and that kind of independence are lacking today at the departments of defense justice and treasury and at the agency for international development the need for that kind of focal point is unmistakable at the department of defense where some 18 000 auditors investigators and inspectors struggle to pinpoint and eliminate waste and inefficiency their task is made more difficult by the fact thatdespite the gargantuan size of the departmentno single individual has clear unquestioned responsibility or authority for coordinating the work of the 18 000 waste hunters i understand that an administrative decision has been made to create within the department an assistant to the secretary for review and oversight and that this new official will have some of the duties and responsibilities of a statutory inspector general this new official however will be solely under the control and direction of the secretary will not report to the congress and will always be in danger of having his office dismantled administratively just as easily as it was created administratively for those reasons a statutory inspector general with the powers and duties outlined by h r 2098 would in my view be much more preferable and much more effective the departments of

fully in line with the omnibus inspector general act of 1978 h r 2098 will remedy that oversight and will give us an inspector general at aid who reports to the congress as well as to the director of the agency if we are truly to wage a war against fraud and abuse it is essential that each agency and department operate with maximum efficiency and economy it is my firm belief that h r 2098 will

inspect various nuclear power and waste facilities this tour involved 5 days in japan and 5 days in taiwan while the primary purpose of this visit especially in japan was to learn about the status of the commercial use of nuclear power in these foreign countries i also used the occasion to talk with the officials of these governments about other matters of foreign and domestic policy the overwhelming impression i have of these countries is their successful economic growth and the purposeful linkage of that objective with developing independent sources of energy both countries have expanded their economies using the free enterprise system as much as possible and keeping state planning restrictions to a minimum what this means for the stability of their currencies unemployment rates and the continued improvement in the standard of living for the japanese and the free chinese people i will defer to the economists for detailed analyses but there is no doubt that in general both countries are in very good shape economically despite having small land masses and very few natural resources of their own although there are many factors contributing to the success stories of these two allies of the united states as you know my responsibilities on the energy and commerce committee would cause me to look carefully at their energy policies having done so i believe that these senergy policieskeyed tp making japan and taiwan independent of the opec oil cartelconstitute a major reason for the current good health of the japanese and the free chinese the time spent in japan was devoted to examining the countrys nuclear power developments japan presently has 22 nuclear powerplants in operation~ with an installed capacity of 15 000 mwe thereby making it the second largest nuclear power producer in the world nuclear pow~er supplies approximately 13 percent of japans total electriclty and accounts for about 4 percent of its total energy supply by 1990 jarqns goal is to almost triple the percentage of nuclear power in its energy mix as in other countries there jr some opposition to nuclear projects especially from local populations ~ proposed nuclear sites nevertheless i believe there are three fundamental reasons why japan will move forward with its nuclear programs first there is a strong consensus in the government and among the japanese people in favor of nuclear power because of its critical linkage to their domestic economy and international trade second the nuclear industry iswellstaffed and wellfinanced it is better integrated with the other japanese economic sectorsbanks universities and governmentthan any other japanese energy producer the japan atomic industrial forum is made up of a large cross section of japans economic interests going fer beyond reactor manufacturers accordingly one can expect an expanded public relations campaign designed to educate the public to the positive a~pects and beniefits of nuclear power and third nuclear power represents the closest energyindependent source that japan can attain toward this end japan has a vigorous research and development program in all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle beginning with exploration for uranium through waste disposal the principal japanese organization for undertaking these programs is the power reactor nuclear fuel develormant corp pnc pnc is actively engaged in reprocessing spent nuclear fuel at its tokalmura facility which i visited close to a hundred tons of spent fuel have been reprocessed at this faciity moreover at the same site a plutonium fuel fabrication plant is in operation pnc also has responsibility for the design construction and operation of japans joyo fastbreeder research reactor plans are underway for construction of the 300mwe monju fast breeder prototype reactor and a target date for operation has been set for december 1987 the total cost of construction will be approximately 400 billion yen 200 million twenty percent of the total cost80 billionwill be borne by the private sector itaiwan has an equally if not more ambitious nuclear program for the future although due to the difference in industrialization with japan it of course has far fewer nuclear powerplants now in operation nevertheless by the end of this century the goal of the free chinese is to have about half of their electricity emanating from nuclear power their existing powerplauts have been built by general electric and westinghouse however for the first time the taiwan power co is now seriously considering purchasing a system hid by a company other than one from the united states the company in question is a french one in answer to my inquiries about this possible change in what has heretofore been an exclusively buy american policy on nuclear matters i was given the following answer recent uncertainties about the consistency and rellability of unitedstates commercial nuclear power export policies i my visit to taiwan was more general in nature than in japan so that the itinerary included more than just nuclear matters as a result i was able to talk to president chiang chifigkuo premier sunyun suan and several of the cabinet secretaries about developments in their areas of responsibility of interest to the united states along with inspecting one of their nuclear powerplants in the republic of china i had the unique opportunity to spend a day on the island of quemoy where the state of military readiness is indeed something to see i also met with representatives of the american institute in taiwan the american soybean association and the american chamber of commerce to learn more about current conditions in taiwan especially following the unitedstates derecognition decision in 1978 as you know a legislative factfinding trip is more important for what one learns than for what one sees while i saw some new thingssince i had never been to the orient befortamong other things what i learned in japan and taiwan that has particular significance for current unitedstates export and energy policies was twofold first in order to get out from under the thumb of the opec oil cartel both countries are offsetting oil as an energy source with nuclear power and second not only are we losing business for our people because of the inflexible nuclear nonprolif eration act of 1978 but more importantly we are losing control over the sensitive materialplutoniumwhich becomes more accessible with the development of advanced nuclear technologies around the world both japan and taiwan would rather work with united states on constructing nuclear reactors purchasing enriched uranium reprocessing the spent fuel safeguarding the sensitive material and managing the wastes involved but for

many people that did not agree we have to move toward balancing the budget but i think it is clear from talking to constituents from the mail from public opinion polls that certainly people are just as concerned about waste in the defense department as they are in any other program be it food stamps or anything else i think that when it is clear that we have to strengthen our defenses in this country it is even more important to keep the faith with the american people so that they can understand how the money is being spent they can see it is being spent properly and if we do not keep that faith with the american people i think we can be assured that at some point some mistakes will be made along the way if we do not have strong oversight over spending this congress will be very embarrassed money will be wasted and in fact we will lose part of the mandate we have to have to strengthen the conventional forces of this country i was very surprised to see the rollcall to table

fifth such bill in as many years reported out by the permanent select committee on intelligence like its predecessors it was approved unanimously in committee as it was by the committee on armed services this information was echoed by my colleague the gentleman from massachusetts who handled the rule on the majority side and our colleague the gentleman for arizona who handled the rule on the minority side i want to express to them my appreciation for their remarks concerning all the members of this particular committee and the nonpartisan manner in which it has operated as in past years this bill authorizes all the funds for the next fiscal year as well as supplemental funds in the current fiscal year for the intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the unitedstates government the category of intelligence activities includes all the activities of the central intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the national security agency other intelligence components of the department of defense and the departments of the army navy and air force the bureau of intelligence and research of the department of state the intelligence divisions of the federal bureau of investigation intelligence elements of the departments of the treasury and energy and the drug enforcement administration and the intelligence community staff of the director of central intelligence these activitles provide intelligence for the use of the president the cabinet the national security council and the joint chiefs of staff further this bill authorizes intelligencerelated activities of the department of defense which are programs that are integral to the defense force structure but which are similar to national intelligence programs and are often tasked for national intelligence purposes particularly in peacetime the similarity of programs and functions between the national intelligence programs and the intelligencerelated activities of the defense department is the reason that both are considered by the permanent select committee on intelligence and authorized in this bill we have worked to assure that the program areas arecomplementary and mutually supportive but not duplicative the referral of this bill to the committee on armed services has assured that the judgments we have made from an intelligence viewpoint are equally sound from a military perspective we have worked closely with that committee on a continuous basis and achieved a position agreeable to both committees even before referral most intelligence activities are classified and necessarily so in some cases even the very existence of the program or activity is held secret this sensitivity limits the description we can offer here on the floor the schedule of authorizations to accompany the bill and the classifled annex to the report have been available to members a number of members have reviewed these materials the subject material is complex but we have continued to revise these classified reports to improve their clarity the committee continues to recommend that the budget for intelligence not be disclosed the disclosure of a single budget number might not itself be harmiul but some explanation of the content and meaning of the number would be essential but such an explanation would be excessively revealing moreover the committee recognizes that intelligence is inherently secret and any disclosure is the beginning of an erosive process in discussing this point people often refer to the degree of disclosure of our military budgets and systems it is not a good analogy the existence of military systems must be known in order to have deterrent value if deterrence fails military systems are effective in battle because of their numbers the manner in which they are employed and the skill of the personnel using them conversely in the case of intelligence the mere awareness of an intelligence activity can easily reduce or eliminate its effectiveness may endanger lives and may lead to the collection of false information contrived by our adversaries to confuse or mislead us i would like to summarize briefly the organization of i r title i provides for the bulk of our intelligence and intelligencerelated activities as i said earlier funds and program details are in the classified schedule of authorizations and the annex to the report one exception is the authorization for the counterterrorism program of the fbi which is unclassified the bill provides 12 1 million for this function title ii provides necessary authorities for the intelligence community staff whose function is to assist the director of central intelligence with his responsibilities for overall coordination of intelligence and preparation of the budget the staff is made up of representatives of all elements of the intelligence community administratively it is treated as if part of the cia title iii provides authorization of 91 3 million for the central intelligence agency retirement and disability system this is a program established by congress in 1964 to provide for those cia personnel who perform hazardous duties or are in special situations usually abroad which may limit the length of their careers when title iii is read for amendment i will offer a technical amendment that would conform ciards as it is called so as to afford certain ciards retirees the opportunity to exercise options which can be made by their counterparts under the civil service retirement and disability system although current law now permits the president by executive order to conform ciards to prospective changes made to the civil service system the differences in question existed prior to this change in the law hence the need for the amendments title iv authorizes additional intelligence and intelligencerelated expenditures in fiscal year 1982 the details of this supplemental authorivation are found in the classified annex to the committees report title v consists of a provision prohibiting the unauthorized use of the defense intelligence agencys name initials or seal in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such use was authorized and authorizing the attorney general to seek to enjoin such unauthorized use this section is identical to those enacted last year protecting against the unauthorized use of the cia and nsa names initials or seals title vi contains a provision providing to spouses and former spouses of certain cia employees entitlements and rights in relation to retirement and survivors annuities comparable to those provided to spouses of foreign service officers by the foreign service act of 1980 this provision recognizes the enormous equity that cia spouses have in their employee spouses careersboth in terms of the assistance they provide to intelligence operations and their sacrifice of their own professional advancement the committee was thoroughly persuaded that these spouses deserve the same benefits as do foreign service officers spouses nonetheless the bills provisions are more stringent than those of the foreign service act since they require that spouses to qualify must serve overseas with their employee spouses one reason for the bipartisan support which h r 6068 enjoys is that all of the recommendations of the subcommittee on program and budget authorization adopted by the committee have been so painstakingly documented and reasoned in their approach i attribute the great success of this effortand the important and oftneeded guidance it has provided the intelligence communityto the judgment and character of the ranking minority member ken robinson of virginia he has been the rock upon which the work of the subcommittee has been built and he deserves the thanks not only of the congr6ss but of the nation for his great contribution in this area i should also add that the staff who assist the committee in its consideration of the intelligence and intelligencerelated budgets is first class i believe they are the finest the most professional of all who work on the intelligence budget in either the executive or legislative branches i would like to pay tribute and thanks to duane andrews jim bush marty faga annette smiley and patrica garber as in the last fiscal year this bill authorizes less than the administration requested but still permits real growth over last year some specific proposals have been recommended for deferral others for termination while a few have been increased let me close by stating that as in years past the

fish and wildlife populations and outdoor recreational and educational opportunities also diminish or disappear while continued federal acquisition of needed conservation easements is a part of the solution other essentially nonfederal solutions also need to be impleniented h r 4680 was such a proposal it was designed to provide tax relief to those who sell certain lands or easements toqualified agencies and organizations for conservation purposes since its introduction i have received a significant number of very constructive improvement suggestions from a variety of conservation groups and others the discussions followingsenator wallops public lands workshop last summer have also provided additional valuable information accordingly i elected to redraft this legislation somewhat to clarify several definitions and to avoid conflict with existing tax incentives for donations of partial interests in land for conservation purposes the primary purpose and intent of h r 6465 remains the same as h r 4680 that purpose is to exclude from gross income for tax purposes amounts received from certain sales of key natural area lands to qualified organizations including the various states and the united states if the primary use of such land after the sale is for a conservation purpose and that purpose is protected in perpetuity the primary change in this new legislation is to delete the definitions contained in h r 4680 and to adopt the conservation terms previously approved by the congress and enacted into law in the tax treatment extension act of 1980 the tax treatment extension act of 1980 public law 96541 insured the deductibility of the donation of gifts of partial interests in land for conservation purposes at the time that proposal was subject to intensive review the result was a thorough and carefully structured law the tax treatment extension act is only applicable to partial interest donations that are within a carefully defined list of conservation purposes the conservation purposes must be protected in perpetuity and the recipient of the donation must be a qualified notforprofit or governmental organization with the commitment and resources necessary to protect the conservation purpose in essence i have taken the solutions worked out by the congress last session with regard to donations for natural conservation purposes and applied them to sales of conservation areas for a conservation purpose one problem identified with regard to h r 4680 was the negative impact on donations the incentive to donate to a conservation organization for a conservation purpose would be lost if an incentive to sell also applied h r 6465 corrects that situation i have structured this new bill so that it will complement not restrict existing incentives for donations the tax treatment extension act is applicable to the donation of a partial interest that is less than an owners entire interest in a given area h r 6465 covers the opposite situation where an owner wants to sell his entire interest rather than retain limited rigihts or sell a conservation easement for fish and wildlife purposes in this manner an incentive to sell will not generally be applicable to the same interest in land that is covered by the tax treatment extension act an owner has to sell his entire interest or an easement for fish and wildlife conservation purposes to be covered by h r 6465 this could of course overlap with a donation of an owners entire interest but unlike partial interest donations donations of this kind would not insure conservetion protection and therefore geierally serve a different purpose however h r 6465 covers conservation easements sold to qualified organizations for fish and wildlife conservation purposes because of the critical special needs in this area this new legislation also provides federal estate tax relief in certain cases permitting the value of qualified property transferred to a qualified organization to be considered as payment of part or all of the estate taxes due and the postponement of estate taxes due on qualified property being transferred to a qualified organization until the transfer is completed or cancelled in summary h r 6465 excludes gain from the sale or exchange of real property to a qualified organization for conservation purposes the term qualified organization is given the same meaning as provided by the tax treatment extension act similarly the term conservation purpose is defined in reference to that act but limited to three major natural conservation purposes as follows the preservation of land areas for outdoor recreation by or the education of the general public the protection of a relatively natural habitat of fish wildlife or plants or similar ecosystem or the preservation of open space including farmland and forest landwhere such preservation isone for the scenic enjoyment of the general public or two pursuant to a clearly delineated federal state or local governmental conservation policy and will yield a significant public benefit while restrictive these major natural conservation purposes are flexible enough to insure that areas sold to conservation organizations for a conservation purpose can continue to be used and managed as necessary for maintaining the conservation purpose these are not wilderness area categories no lands would be converted to wilderness areas under this legislation traditional conservation management practices and recreation uses such as hunting and fishing would be permitted to be continued however the conservation purpose would have to be protected in perpetuity h r 6465 addresses several other key issues third party transactions would be permitted the sale to a nonqualified organizationsuch as a major corporationwould be covered if the purchaser thereafter contributes such property to a qualified organization within 6 months the legislation would not be applicable to shortterm transactionsthe exclusion would only apply if the gain in question was longterm capital gains rhe legislation would not be applicable to governmental acquisition by actual seizure requisition or condemnation it would be applicable however if the property were merely under the threat of condemnationsuch as if it were within the boundaries of a conservation area or purchased on a willing seller basis this is an important distinction this legislation is primarily designed to encourage private state and local sales to the degree it applies to federal transactions it can only be costeffective if it encourages prompt transactions the cost of this incentive cannot be supported if it is added to the expense of costly condemnation proceedings h r 6465 also has a 10year sunset provision which will insure that sales for a conservation purpose are not delayed the intent is to deal as quickly as possible with present holdings and thus prevent them from being stripped down or subdivided and then sold for a less desirable conservation purpose many years hence this provision is not applicable in cases where the sale is of a taxpayers entire remaining interest which follows the donation of an earlier

making these projections i only wish to point out that when viewed against the standards by which we judged spending only 1 year ago all of the alternatives presented in the 97th congress have represented extremely conservative budgets in proposing these budget shifts the ultimate goal of all our efforts has been to implement the administrations economic recovery program fully but in a way that would distribute the burden fairly and avoid the shockwaves and economic disruption that can occur from sudden elimination of programs that fill legitimate needs in our society i do not feel good about the way the legislative process has been abruptly changed to effect social change i am however pleased that significant alterations have been made to accommodate what i believe were substantial deficiencies in the administrations original budget proposals i am hopeful that as the year goes on more rational responsible reasonable changes can be made to lessen any detrimental impact of these

vote against the railroad demonstrations the gentleman may ask why the reason is because we thought the solution we were offering was a better solution for the gentleman from illinois and the others because there are 18 demonstration projects the total cost of these is over 1 billion the federal government cannot possibly find the resources to finance them as individual items and so we suggested that if the state or local agency wished to go on with their project and wished to use some of their own allocated money either from the primary secondary or urban apportionment we would let them have it at a 95to5 match which is extremely favorable right now the primary secondary and urban systems match is at 75 to 25 so this does make money available if a state thinks that a project is of such high priority it can take that money they are getting for work on the system and use it with a 19toi match i might also say that we have had most of these 18 demonstration projects on the books since 1973 and very little money hs gone out in all this time so the present program is not even working we think ours will because in recent years there has been very little money actually going to these projects we think our solution allowing states to use their apportionments with a 19toi match is a much better inducement to get these railroad demos built than would reauthorization of the separate

phrases used by tass the soviet unions official news agency i think every member of congress should become acquainted with this newspeak of the sovipts at the same time we should be asking ourselves how much time and energy and money are we in the united states spending to send our message to those in other lands compared with the soviet unions funding of its unrelenting program of antiunitedstates propaganda it is my hope that president reagan will make one of his top foreign policy priorities the revitalization and rebuilding of the unitedstates overseas information program i insert in the record tass all the propaganda thats fit to print and dictionary of tasm words and phrases by david k willis of the christian science monitor january 12 1981 tass all the propaganda thats fit to by david k willis moscow the kremlin challenge comes not only in tanks and rockets but also in wordsthe kind that clack endlessly from the small gray teleprinter that stands beside a battered gas stove and a small and ancient refrigerator in the back room of the christian science monitor office here the room was built as a kitchen the office like all others in our building was originally a small apartment the kitchen setting is apt though the little gray machine serves up dish after dish of propaganda prepared by the soviet news agency tass the russian initials for the telegraph agency of the soviet union according to recipes set forth by the kremlin the material is hard to read harder to digest no spontaneity no fun no liveliness but after standing by the machine for 4a years starting and ending the day with its gray view of the world i find myself wishing all americans and their allies had to read it for at least a few days they would find the broadest and crudest of challenges their own world turned on its head all ideals and assumptions reversed all items subordinated to the destructive view that everything good in the world is soviet or prosoviet and everything bad is american or proamerican tass sends its basic service around the world it reads all major overseas wire agences and countles western journals taking advantage of western freedom to play back criticisms of the west and ignore positive developments senior members of the communist party here are not given such heavily censored material some get white tass which is a fuller compendium of associated press united press international reuters and others top people get red tass which appears to be an almost complete version of daily news in short what anyone can read abroad only the top people can see here tass is not a news agency at all except that it does relay soviet speeches and announcements every now and then it inserts a lighter note the walrus population rising the discovery of the bones of mammoths on which man may have beaten out primitive music but even then the basic aim of tass is preserved to boost the soviet system when it comes to the united states no slander is bad enough here is one complete item which indicates its lack of normal western standards of reporting bonn feb 9 tass during exercises in the frg west germany an american tank ran into a fence around a residential house in the city of alzev knocking down a west german policeman the tank drove away from the accident scene the policeman died item ends no other details no explanations nothing except the barest details rewritten from local reports to make the us look as bad as possible have there been accidents involving soviet troops in eastern europe dont read tam to find out the russian service is translated into other languages the english version is awkward since translation must be word for word to ensure political correctness the last man to see the material before it is handed to teleprinter punchers is the political editor who sees that nothing untoward creeps in tass is a nonstop government circular and a relentless propagandist and it uses words familiar to outside readers peace dl tente and so onbut on tass they have very different meanings the world of tass is worth looking at closely it gives insights into the heavy hand of kremlin thought and action the ideology in whose name all actions are taken and justified many people openly disbelieve the ideology by now but its hold on power is still great if we let tass words bounce around the world without knowing what they are and what they want to do we simply make the kremlins job easier so here below is a minidictionary of tass terms it is offered in the tradition of the marquis de custine a wise french nobleman who toured czarist russia for five months in 1839 i do not blame the russians for being what they are he wrote later i blame them for pretending to be what we are dicronaary or

words to make contributions on four occasions in the bill it is to dramatize how loose i believe the language is in this piece of legislation i would like to read the first paragraph of the first section because if anybody is concerned about this piece of legislation increasing the power of the regulators i think their concerns would be confirmed by listening to this the corporation is authorized in its sole discretion and upon such terms and conditions as the board of directors may prescribe to make loans to to make deposits in to purchase the assets or securities of to assume the liabilities of or to make contributions to any insured bank1 think the words to make contributions is language which is much too broad for me of course it does conform to the title of the bill the deposit insurance flexibility act because indeed it will give a great deal1 of flexibility but just the idea that the government the regulators the fdic can give contributions is rather astounding i know that someone will get up and possibly give a new definition to contributions but the old definition was that it was something of a donation something that we gave to our church or something that we gave to the united fund we gave a contribution but i believe it goes along with much of what we do here in washington we do give contributions the tragedy is those contributions that we are always giving away happen to come from the pockets of the american taxpayers either in the form of taxes or more inflation i think it is a reasonable request to tighten this language and to drop the word where it appears on four occasions contributions we do not need to be in the business of giving contributions the significance of this bill coming up at this time i think needs some attention the banking institutions are in trouble i for one would recognise the seriousness of our banking institutions and the need for something to be done i would even concede to the authors of the bill that this bill will help on the very very short run but it is somewhat like giving another drink to the alcoholic who needs something to calm his nerves it will certainly calm the nerves of the banking industry but to have a bill like this which means an unlimited source of funds to ball out banks not only the ones that have failed but the ones who have a tendency to fail yes i think those numbers will grow significantly in the next several years and there will be great need for an infusion of large amounts of cash and new credit but to me that means a large infusion and a lot more inflation s3ome would argue this is not inflationary and it will not cost anything yes it will cost something because i believe a lot of new credit and new dollars will be used to go into failing institutions so we are trying to stop the problem of inflation with creating more inflation to give a drink to the alcoholic calms his nerves but it wiil not help him get on the road back to health we must look at the real problem if too much drinking is the problem for the alcoholic too much money is the problem in the economy and in the monetary system our problem is that we have been on an unrelentless binge of money creation this has occurred especially since 1971 up until 1971 there was a minor check held on the monetary authorities because up until august of 1971 there was a connection of the dollar to gold there was a limitation on how much new money the federal reserve could create even though in a minor way since that time we have seen astounding growths in the money supply and interest rates at 20 to 21 percent so we are living in an age of a depreciated currency it is the currency that is sick it is not the banking institutions the unit of account is the problem not the management of our banking institutions if anything our banking institutions have too much regulation we do not have and never did have but that does not mean that we cannot consider having a free market in the banking institutions as well as in other areas of the economy let them compete as other businesses compete instead of propping them up regulating them and bailing them out when they fail i see that great damage can be done by this bill in the way itis written at the present time the clause that permits the interstate banking is quite a danger and yet in a free market system you do permit interstate banking but it develops in a very normal and natural way the way it will develop with this legislation could prove disastrous to the small institutions and beneficial to the large ones as mergers will occur through government bailout procedures"]]}
