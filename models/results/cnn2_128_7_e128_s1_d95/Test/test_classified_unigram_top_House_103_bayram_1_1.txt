decade of the reaganbush years and their initiatives hardly resulted in greater investment or smaller deficits when ronald reagan moved into the white house the deficit was just over 74 billion and

change of direction surely even given its worst assessment the clinton plan could come nowhere close to the reckless results of the past two republican administrations and what do my republican

party wrought more than 40 republican members voted no on every plan even their own partys instead the republican party embarked on an unprecedented campaign of misinformation falsely alleging the

income taxes need i repeat that families with higher incomes will pay higher taxes as they should during the last decade the wealthy saw their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period middleclass families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middleclass families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directiy to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected deficit by about 500 billion it also invests in families and in small business in el paso alone families living in poverty despite both parents fulltime

gentleman for yielding time to me i find the rhetoric on the kasich amendment interesting my good friend from ohio described this amendment and describes the current reconciliation process and that is all because that is basically what the gentleman described is what is potential for the congress to do each year under reconciliation unfortunately his amendment does things more than simply reaffirm the reconciliation process i would argue that because it is a substitute and wipes out the base bill it does less to require the congress to examine entitlements every year than the base spratt bill because the very essence of the spratt bill is that it does not deal with projections it does deal with reality for the previous year and projections from the current year to require the congress and the president to reexamine entitlements in fact if they are exceeding estimates it is my judgment if we take on face value what the kasich bill does versus the basic underlying bill introduced by our friend the gentleman from south carolina it weakens the requirement on congress to annually review what is happening with entitlements unfortunately the kasich bill does more than simply reaffirm the existing reconciliation bill as described let me speak to some red herrings and to some other complexities it does create we have had a couple of speeches by the republican leaders on social security that is a red herring that is not involved in the base spratt bill because current budget rules say that we cannot deal with social security in reconciliation so that is not an issue but it does do other things it does increase the power of the president very substantially as congress tries to deal with the reconciliation in the budget process maybe i should be for it it does in some fashion increase the power of the committee on the budget in relationship to authorizing committees how does it do that no 1 kasich changes the nature of the budget resolution from being a congressional budget resolution to being a joint resolution subject to presidential veto that fundamentally shifts the power away from congress to the executive as we deal with the budget i would remind members particularly as it relates to discretionary spending the history has been the presidents whether it be republican or democrats have wanted to spend more on discretionary spending than the congress it also complicates how we deal with the specifics if in the reconciliation process we decide to make budget cuts and let me use medicare as an example my good friend from ohio has been a strong advocate of increasing premiums increasing copays and a variety of methods like that for meeting budget targets under his proposal as i understandlit and frankly i have had to have several explanations to begin to think that i understand it because what it clesrly does is add substantial complexity and not much substance to the process if in the reconciliation process the budget resolution assumes certain savings to let us take ways and means and energy and commerce as it relates to medicare programs and we assume certain changes in expenditure levels and certain changes in premium payments those committees could not increase the amount of premiums or copays above the level assumed in the committee on the budget as i understand the resolution that would be the case that flexibility for the committee would disappear it would generally apply to any other proposal for use such as fees if the committee decided to do that beyond the level assumed by the committee on the budget in achieving their savings they would not have that option of doing it so i would suggest to the members that what the kastch amendment does is it takes power from the congress gives it to the president for no good reason it increases substantially the complexity of the budget process limits the ability of authorizing committees to meet the targets set in a budget resolution under reconciliation instructions and when we are through all of this it provides less automatic review of entitlement spending than the proposal by our good friend the gentleman from south carolina"],

millions scrap tires discarded annually in section 1038 congress supported the e panded use of these technologies i agree th congress should not impose mandates in indiscriminate and arbitrary manner mc members of congress would agree with ma preferring that we provided states with inca tives rather than a requirement to ude the technologies however in this case secti 1038 requires use of a low minimum threshc of these products because the existing co tracting system has failed to accept the technologies and has slowed the developme of a national market for these products in june of this

a the federal highway adrinistration may not disapprove funding for any crumb rubber modifier project again section 330 could not modify section 1038 a of istea without violating house rule 21 finally the federal highway administration issued implementation guidelies which allow states to use reclaimed asphalt pavement which they already use in large quantities to meet the section 1038 requirements

of sugar land continuing on out to rosenberg tx this is the proposed super highway from the canadian border to mexico houston is a growing city the surrounding area has exploded in fact in recent years fort bend county which is the county where the highway study would be made has been the fastest growing county in the nation there has been a literal explosion of population to the southwest of houston mr chairpnan the federal highway administration and the texas department of transportation have made incredible efforts to keep up with the demands on the highway system in this area roughly 13 miles of the southwest freeway from the center of houston out to beltway 8 has recently completed years of construction to widen and increase the overall capacity of the highway the highway has been widened in some places to 12 lanes further the state has already started in motion the design and engineering of the next portion of the southwest freeway which takes the improved road out
