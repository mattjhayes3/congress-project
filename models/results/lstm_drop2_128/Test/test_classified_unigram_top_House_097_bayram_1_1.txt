catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g

is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president

president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.12005162239074707, 0.8799483776092529, 1, "h r 4879 now before the house with a committee amendment in the nature of a substitute is a bill that deals with two very significant banking matters on which prompt action is vital in effect the committee amendment for convenience incorporates two separate bills ordered reported by the banking corxmittee on november 5 into a single bill containing two titles title i of the bill contains the text of a bill introduced on november 2 as h r 4879 by my colleague from new york mr schumeri dealing with international banking facilities on december 3 1981 pursuant to regulations of the federal reserve board international banking facilities will be permitted in the united states 113fs may be established by unitedstates depository institutions by edge and agreement corporations and by unitedstates branches and agencies of foreign banks the board issued proposed rules last december and adopted the final rule june 18 1981 with an effective date of in brief an ibf may accept deposits from and extend credit to foreign residents or other ibfs all such funds will be exempt from reserve requirements and from interest rate limlitations of regulation q the purpose of ibfs at unitedstates banking offices is to enhance the international competitive position of banking institutions in the united states consistent with this basic purpose it now becomes necessary to review thle february 18 1981 interpretation of fdic to thle effect that ibf deposits are subject to fdic insurance assessments under the federal deposit insurance act the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision regulation and insurance of thle house banking committee heard testimnony that if unitedstates ibfs are required to pay the fdic premium amounting to onetwelfth of 1 percent of their deposits then they will be comnpetitive y disadvantaged this premium is considered especially important because as the testimony indicated many ibfs may operate on very narrow margins title i of h r 4879 would eliminate the insurance requirement for what in essence are deposits of extremely sophisticated international investors seeking the highest possible yields with the december 3 effective date nearing congress has an opportunity to prevent burdensome regulation and at the same time insure competitive equality between unitedstates and foreign banks by actinig in a manner fully consistent with the letter and spirit of theo federal reserve boards action in permitting the establishment of ibifs title i of the bill also includes an amendment adopted at full committee markup extending fdic deposit insurance coverage to branches of insured banks operating in the trust territory of the pacific islands currently fdics authority to insure deposits includes areas in the pacific such as guam and american samoa but under current law fdic cannot offer insurance in the trust territory fslics authority to insure thrift deposits does include the trust territory therefore title i of the bill would expand fdics authority to cover the trust territory title ii of the bill was introduced by myself mr stanton and mr gonzalez and was considered by the committee as h r 4515 this title deals with existing statutory limitations affecting mortgage purchases both by the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association present charter requirements limit the dollar value of loans which are more than 1 year old when sold to 20 percent of the total value of conventional mortgages in fhlmcs or fnmas portfolios this limitation will soon raise serious problems in connection with new programs under which fhlmc and fitma will use their currently unused capacity to purchase or place older mortgages and it is expected as a result provide improved liquidity to mortgage lending institutions this is november 17 1 981 the highly successful swap program of the federal home loan mortgage corporation this program in the short period it has been in effect has been popular indeed inasmuch as it permits the swapping of older lowyielding mortgage loans for mortgage corporation participation certificates pcs these illiquid mortgages responsible in large part for difficulties being encountered by the thrift industry are converted into highly liquid securities ultimately additional funds are freed up for new mortgage funding i have been advised by fhlmc that with its most recent auction fhlmc has virtually reached its 20 percent ceiling for all practical purposes and that absent this legislation now the program must be shut down until such time as purchases of new mortgages in the corporations other programs made it possible to hold another swap auction it is now clear that the value of new loans will be depressed for 1982 and as a consequence it seems unlikely that the swap program can be offered at anywhere near a level commensurate with the need and demand unless congress approves this legislation another provision of title ii would give the same seller service status to fdic and ncua as that fslic with respect to using fhlmc and f nma programs to aid troubled financial institutions and to dispose of loan portfolios acquired in takeovers this flexibility is fully consistent with action taken by the house on october 28 in passing overwhelmingly h r 4603 the socalled regulators bill the provisions now

myself as chairman of the intergovernmental relations and human resources subcommittee i want to thank the other members and the conferees on the committee for the cooperation they gave us and for sticking with those of us who had been interested in section 1117 in this bill i think this is one of the most important provisions in this bill because it will enable the inspector general to coordinate the auditing and investigative activities of the department of defense and in my opinion in the years to come will save billions and billions of dollars the department of defense authorization bill contains a number of provisions which are of great importance to the future of our national defense program by far the most important of these provisions in my judgment is the one which establishes a statutory office of inspector general at the department of defensesection 1117 as most of you know i have devoted a great deal of time and effort over the last 7 or 8 years in working to establish a system of statutory offices of inspector general in federal departments and agencies there are now 16 statutory inspectors general in civilian departments and agencies there is still a very long way to go but their work is beginning to produce very significant benefits to the taxpayers through improved economy and efficiency and reduction of fraud and abuse in federal programs the present situation is a tremendous improvement over the old system where auditors and investigators couldas a practical matterbe kept from doing their job whenever agency heads and program managers so desired the statutory office of inspector general which this bill will create at the department of defense is more urgently needed than any of the others in contrast to most civiliai agencies where programs are being cut back spending by the department of defense is increasing rapidly over the next 5 years dod is expected to spend more than 12 trillion i have consistently supported defense appropriations unfortunately as all of us know an unacceptably high percentage of the funds made available to the defense department has beenand still is beingexpended in a manner which does little or nothing to strengthen our national defense we cannot expect the nations taxpayers to continue to provide massive funding for the defense departmentat considerable personal sacrificeunless we provide far greater assurance that their money will not be wasted or stolen this bill will help greatly in providing that assurance by establishing a dod inspector general whose independence is protected by statute the department of defense exerted great effort to prevent the establishment of an independent office of inspector general dod openly acknowledged that they wanted the inspector general to be subject to the authority direction and control of the secretary so that he or she could not investigate matters the secretary did not want investigated although the house had twice voted for an independent dod inspector general by overwhelming margins the senate versions of the defense authorization bill called for an inspector general who would be subject to the authority direction and control of the secretary i served as a member of the conference committee on the section of the defense authorization bill relating to the office of inspector general section 1117 in the record i am glad to be able to report thatthanks to the solid support provided by all house confereesthe house position prevailed and we will have an independent office of inspector general we did yield to the senate in providing that the inspector general might be subject to the authority of the secretary in specific instances in which the secretary determined that an inspector general investigation might endanger the national security however in order to prevent national security from being used as a cloak to cover up waste fraud and abuse we provided that the inspector general must report to the appropriate congressional committees if and when this national security provision is invoked and the secretary of defense is required to provide a full explanation of his actions to the house and senate armed services committees and the senate governmental affairs and the house government operations committees i do not believe the president would nominateor the senate confirman inspector general who would knowingly jeopardize the national security that is why the language was unnecessary but we need the office so badly in the defense department that these compromises with the senate conferees were necessary it should rarelyif everbe necessary for a secretary of defense to order an inspector general to stop an investigation on national security grounds

departments will be left without independent statutory inspectors general they just happen to be the two most important law enforcement agenciesthe treasury and justice departments by and large these two agencies have good records for honesty and integrity unfortunately a high degree of integrity while essential does not assure a high degree of effectiveness our law enforcement operations must be managed more effectively and statutory inspectors general are urgently needed to help accomplish this task this will be my last year in congress the house has voted to establish statutory igs at the treasury and justice departments on two separate occasions and housepassed legislation for this purpose is currently pending in the senate i hope these last two inspectors general will become a

munition is absolutely safe existing chemical munitions for which this would be a substitute are extremely dangerous plans call for only one of the agents of the binary munitions to be located for example at pine bluff ark in this particular case ql which is the phosphorus ester and could be commercially produced would be located at pine bluff the other agent is powdered sulfur and would be

we are not to have the unitary systcm shall we disarm unilaterally or shall simply replace the system in my judgment a proposition which will be offered deserves our support which will involve a

exportrelated industries as a result of foreign retaliation thus the domestic content bill leaves many questions unanswered in light of this we must not view this bill as a panacea the deeprooted problems of our ailing automobile industry and indeed of our entire economy will not be solved by merely insulating ourselves from foreign competition we must seek longterm answers to the problems of lagging productivity and quality control that plague our industries if we are to produce american cars that will be competitive in the international marketplace as imperfect as this bill is however it is time that something be done to alleviate the burden that subsidized for eign imports have placed on our economy we must send a clear message to our trading partners and especially to japan of our intent they must be told that the united states will not stand by and watch its automobile industry be weakened by subsidized imports while our products are unable to penetrate foreign trade barriers the inability of the reagan administration to negotiate substantial trade concessions with japan and its unwillingness to address the problems that current trade practices have created for our domestic economy have left the responsibility for action on the shoulders of congress we have heard more than enough talk on this issue it is time now for substantive action this bill must be our way

programs although the exact amount of overpayments caused by recipients not properly reporting income is unknown the qeneral accounting office estimates that in fiscal years 1978 and 1979 five of six

clearly this situation needs to be remedied given the current shortage of funds for public assistance programs we must insure that funds go only to those in need with the least amount of error or payment to those who may have other sources of income in addition my bill will make available to child support enforcement agencies the wage information of delinquent parents even though this will not

united states will make a serious error in its central american policy if it attempts to analyze the recent elections in el salvador in the manner in which we analyze the elections in our own country the voter turnout on sunday clearly exceeded prevoting expectations though it does not at this time appear to be as big as the turnout in 1977 that voter participation is the product of several factors the elections were held largely in cities under the control of mayors appointed by the junta people who have a personal stake with an interest in generating the greatest voter turnout possible failure of the mayors to do so might have been seen as an indication of insufficient commitment to the junta and the military with predictable consequences fear by individual votes of retaliation by the right wing for failing to vote in the election intimidation of voters by the armed forces a desire by the salvadoran people to break the cycle of violence for they are the victims of this civil war their government is responsible for vicious atrocities and repression against the people elections have historically beenused by the right wing and the military to legitimize their position however as degraded as the democratic process has been in that country this election at least offered the salvadoran people a means of expressing their rejection of violence the election however does not mean that el salvador has a democracy the united states cannot regard elections during a civil war by a repressive government as the means by which a people democratically elect a legitimate government it would be the most dangerous kind of wishful thinking on the part of the united states to put behind us or now to excuse the circumstances under which this election was held or to believe that the election has ended them the cornerstone of the reagan administration policy on el salvador has been that the march 28 elections would produce an election victory for the christian democratic party and for president jose napolean duarte the administration sought support in congress and among the american people for continued and increasing military and economic aid to the government of el salvador on the grounds that the aid was necessary to strengthen the moderate civilian elements within the ruling junta the commitment of the christian democratic party to social and economic reform was used to justify a policy of unitedstates intervention and support for a rightwing oppressive military guilty of gross violations of human rights that unitedstates policy suffered from a fatal defect in that president duarte and the christian democratic party did not have control over the military the defense minister gereral garcia controls the military but duarte did not and does not control garcia after my visit to el salvador in february i had serious reservations about holding an election in a country locked in a civil war i believed that it was essential to end the killing and the violence first then through negotiations bring all political parties into the elections process and then to hold elections in an atmosphere of peace time and time again our congressional delegation heard how elections had been used in the past to legitimatize a repressive right wing government in 1972 the military deprived president duarte of his rightful victory in the presidential election i became concerned that even if president duarte won this election the outcome would not alter the fundamental defect in the duarte governmentthe inability of civilian moderate forces to exercise control over the military my fear was that the election would legitimatize the de facto control that gen jose guillermo garcia exercises over the government and the people the election however did not produce the result around which the state department had structured unitedstates policy while the christian democratic party won over 40 percent of the vote the majority of the 60 seats in the legislative assembly will be held by right wing parties the extreme right wing nationalist republican alliance arena founded only last year by roberto daubuisson will be the second largest party with approximately 29 percent of the seats the right wing parties will now attempt to form a coalition government to exclude president duarte and the christian democrats the reagan administration will attempt to insure that some christian democrats are included in any new government the administration may also succeed in persuading the right wing coalition not to make daubuisson leader of a coalition government the administration correctly recognizes that it would be impossible for it to obtain support in congress for a government in which daubuisson is either the leader or highly visible the coalition government will not be any more deserving of military assistance from the united states if daubuisson is not a member of the government we should not delude ourselves into believing that all will go well daubilission is excluded from the government we should not think that our policy in el salvador suddenly went wrong only on sunday because duarte did not receive a majority of the votes our policy was wrong before then and is wrong now because it has emphasized support for the military in el salvador over civilian reformist elements within the government and among the people because the united states has failed to insist that the government of el salvador meet the conditions on aid imposed by congress in the foreign assistance act of 1981 as a result of my visit to el salvador i was convinced of the wisdom of the conditions that we in the congress imposed upon that aid we required among other conditions that the government of el salvador make a goodfaith effort to enter into negotiations with all political factions within el salvador that the government make progress toward ending the abuse of human rights by the military the conditions set in law by congress would constitute a sound basis for unitedstates policy in el salvador the united states cannot lose sight of the longrange implications of our policy in that country we cannot give elections in el salvador the same value that we would give to elections in the united states we cannot pretend that an election in el salvador forms the same basis for legitimate government that an election in the united states does our country enjoys longestablished democratic institutions americans were holding democratic elections in the united states before there was actually a united states such elections have almost never been held in el salvadorperhaps twice in its entire history i urge the house the congress the american people to reaffirm their commitment to human rights as a basis for unitedstates policy in el salvador i would very much like to see the united states persuade whatever government is formed in el salvador to undertake negotiations necessary to end the civil war through a political solution my concern is for the people of el salvador who have been the victims of violence from both the right and the left i am deeply concerned however that a coalition of rightwing parties will attempt to win a military victory that will escalate tremendously the violence within el salvador the real victims of such escalation will not be the forces of the leftwing or the rightwing they will be the inno cent the young the old women and children i do not believe that the united states should be providing arms that will be used to kill those innocent victims that

of meat coming into the country the wholesomeness issue is handled through the house agriculture committee as far as the volume of meat coming into the country let me go back to 1964 we passed here in the congress in that year not with my help but over my opposition an upside down formula saying that the bigger the volume of meat that is slaughtered in this country the more meat could be imported into the country do my colleagues know who supported that the national cattlemens association joined with the packers to pass that law i know because they attacked me in the net election because i had opposed the bill that they supported fifteen years later and two cattle cycles later after a lot of their people had gone broke because of the bad law we were able to change the law that is the volume we just changed that upsidedown formula here about 2 years ago bills governing the volume should be changed in that manner the other issue is the wholesomeness of the prod iuct nobody is more for wholesome products than i am i was the author of the 1967 meat inspection bill in 1967 we finally got a bill on the floor of the house over the opposition of the national cattlemens association and the packers over the opposition of both of them the national cattlemens association opposed the bill because some of their producers would not be able to continue selling some of their sick animals and they went right along with the packers who were not processing meat as most people would want them to do but after it was exposed that meat was being sold coming out of rendering plants and other placesfinally with that exposure the majority supported the 1967 meat inspection act so we passed the 1967 law this 1967 law requires as a matter of law that there be equal inspection in foreign countries compared to what we have in this country after that law passed in mexico for example some 32 plants that had been exporting had to close down while five plants were upgraded to meet the standards required in this country the problem is not with the law it is the enforcement of the law i say it is inadequate but we cannot get at that problem by passing this amendment passing an amendment would mislead some people into believing we had taken care of any problems when in fact it had not what we ought to do is actually have equal inspection over there my colleagues say they do not inspect their animals that is not so at all australia and new zealand for example are required to have inspectors just like e have every animal is inspected they are not inspected by our emp1nyees it is their employees they are required to meet the same standards as ours for example that inspectors cannot be the employees of the packing company they must be hired by and paid for by the government so they do not have a conflict of interest the same requirement as for our inspectors in this country as a matter of law they have the same inspection system that we do but we do not have enough supervisory personnel over there and that is what wve are talking about is supervisory personnel comparable to our supervisory personnel to make sure that they are doing the same inspections we have in this country we even know that in some instances over there in those other countries where they have been warned ahead of time when they come in for a spot check the problem is in getting adequate inspection as required by law if a plant is in violation they can even black list the plant completely and should where necessary i do not recall any of those who support this amendment or any of these organizations coming to the appropriations commnittee and complaining this year when the administration submitted the budget to reduce not to increase but to reduce the number of inspectors and actually to go to a spot inspection system in this country with regard to some of our red meat that is what my colleagues ought to do if they really believe in the wholesomeness of the

administration has deemphasized this issue it is up to congress to take the leadership again and reassert the need for a strong human rights policy which can serve our national interests and promote

war over remnants of the antiwar movement turned their attention to the roots of that conflict and pushed for a tighter control on our involvement with repressive foreign policy governments beginning

protecting our environment is an enormous one and the use of senior employees can help get it done the second problem the senior environmental employment program can help to alleviate is the growing numbers of unemployed senior citizens the population of people over the age of 65 is steadily rising and so is poverty boredom and disillusionment among our nations elderly this program is an excellent opportunity for senior citizens to pursue their interests in environmental protection and make a valuable contribution to this nations future e"]]}
