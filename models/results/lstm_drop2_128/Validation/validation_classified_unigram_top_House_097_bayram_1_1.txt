veterans to howard l mowles a va social worker whose contributions have been of enormous value to the problems currently facing many veterans named in honor of the very distinguished former chairman of the house committee on veterans affairs the award goes to a va employee or group of employees working as a team whose achievements have been of special benefit to veterans with serviceconnected injuries the award was established upon mr teagues retirement from the house in 1978 after 32 years of illustrious service to our nation and most especially to veterans this award is indeed a fitting tribute to a man whose accomplishments in the field of veterans rights and benefits are exceeded by none mr mowles was selected for this years award from many nominations submitted by va facilities around the country the entries ranged from work with alcoholic and psychiatric patients to an innovative health care delivery system for veterans with communicative disorders past teague awards have gone for pioneering work in the field of sex education and counseling of spinal cord injury victims for the design and development of devices for veterans with orthopedic or prosthetic disabilities and for the development of a revolutionary process for voice restoration a staff social worker at the jerry l pettis memorial veterans hospital in loma linda calif mowles was chosen for accomplishments in encouraging recovering alcoholics to help themselves by helping others he was instrumental in establishing three local organizations that capitalize on the selfhelp concept pioneered by alcoholics anonymous he specially selected and trained one group of former patients of the facilitys alcoholic treatment unit to help emergency room personnel deal with intoxicated patients a second group provides afterhours emergency transportation together with supportive counseling a third organization has grown into a stateapproved and licensed resident alcohol recovery facility it began when mowles encouraged and helped four patients who had no appropriate posthospital supportive and alcoholfree living environment to share accommodations and expenses and provide mutual support in the award nomination mr mowles was cited for concern and initiative in identifying areas of unmet need for patients which was only overshadowed by his ability to organize patient and community resources and to provide therapeutic costeffective programs which are mutually beneficial to the va the community and most importantly to our veteran patients i am delighted that mrs olin

benefits have alarmed millions of americans and understandably so i am receiving many let ters from my constituents in the bronx and the message is loud and clear oppose president reagans cuts i share the concerns of my constituents apparently the public outcry against these proposals is so great that the administration is slowly backing away from them certainly the 960 vote in the senate against the cuts and the unanimous vote of the house democratic caucus against them should convince the administration to abandon its intolerable proposals which run counter to president reagans campaign pledges these cuts must not become law i shall do what i can to see that they do not certain groups would be hit especially hard by the cuts there would be a onethird cut for the totally disabled and a 40percent cut for those forced to retire before age 62 these cuts which would save 82 billion over the next 5 years are far greater than is necessary to insure the stability of the social security system president reagan and budget director david stockman are not attempting to protect the social security system their intent is to balance the budgetand on the backs of senior citizens their dependents and the disabled these proposals would break faith with millions and millions of workers who have contributed to the social security system let us not forget that social security represents a compact between a worker his employer and the federal government the reagan proposals if enacted would tear that compact asunder benefits are a rightan earned rightand any attempt to cut these benefits would be a statement that the unitedstates government is not as good as its word the reagan administration has claimed that only one of its proposalsthe delay in the effective date of the costofliving adjustmentwould affect current retirees unfortunately this is not the case the administration has proposed eliminating the minimum 122 social security benefit for 3 million people now receiving it such persons would see their benefits calculated to reflect their actual earnings many of them would not lose money spouses benefits and ssi payments would make up for any loss but there are some 1 5 million people who would see their income reduced tragically these would be our most needy senior citizens in fact tens of thousands of americans above the age of 90 would be hit hard if this proposal became law president reagan would also cut benefits for 800 000 students who are survivors and dependents of workers these students would have their benefits cut 25 percent the first year 50 percent the second year 75 percent the third year and then eliminated in the fourth year this would badly hurt thousands of middle and lowincome students many of whom would be forced to end their educations current recipients would also be hurt by the proposals to delay the tcostofliving adjustment cola from july to october and to base the cola on a costofliving comparison over a full year rather than two calendar quarters as is now done the costofliving adjustment must be protected there are those who argue that the present cola is too high because it is based on the increase in prices rather than on wages i disagree it is perhaps true that the consumer price index on which we base the cola overstates the impact of increases in housing costs but in three other areasfood fuel costs and medical expensesthe cpi does not reflect the special needs of the elderly in these areas the elderly suffer from higher costs more than the average midleaged person the administrations proposal to drastically cut benefits for future early retirees is especially brutal most people who take the age 62 retirement option do so because they are sick or because they were forced out of their jobs now the administration announces that it will cut benefits for early retirees by some 40 percent and that this cut will go into effect in just 7 months this is terribly unfair today workers retiring at 62 receive 80 percent of their full entitlement each year that ratio goes up so that those retiring at 65 receive the full 100 percent entitlement but the administration would reduce that 80 percent entitlement to 55 percent over his expected lifetime the average person would lose 31 percent of their benefits by retiring early this is no social security reform it is a travesty and if enacted would undermine and tend to destroy public faith in the social security system fortunately this proposal has very little chance of passage the administration has also proposed changing the benefit computation formula for all future retirees by 1987 this change would permanently reduce monthly benefits by approximately 10 percent this will result from the reduction in the socalled replacement rate today a retiree receives an average of 42 percent of his or her 30year average earnings president reagan would reduce that replacement rate to 38 percent this will especially hurt low and mediumincome workers who in most cases will have no other income besides social security benefits after retirement the presidents proposal would also cut disability benefits by severely tightening eligibility requirements today disability is determined by looking at a number of variables in addition to medical factors the determination takes into account experience age and training obviously a condition that would disable a 60yearold bricklayer might not disable a secretary or a clerk the reagan proposal would not permit examiners to look at the whole person the only criterion considered would be medical condition the administration would also require applicants for disability insurance to have worked 7 years out of the last 10 and also 1 years out of the last 3 years this will badly hurt those suffering from degenerative diseases who may not have been incapacitated at a single moment in time but over the course of years such people are often employed only intermittently before meeting the definition of totally disabled under the reagan proposal a person suffering from a disease like multiple sclerosis might not be disabled enough to qualify for disability insurance but might suffer enough from the condition to be rendered basically unemployable by the time this person became totally disabled he might be rendered ineligible for benefits because of the test of recent earnings these proposals are as unnecessary as they are unfair the administration argues that these proposals will save the social security system from bankruptcy if forsees an 11 billion deficit in the trust funds by 1986 but the cuts proposed to eliminate this deficit would not save 11 million they would save more than 82 billion by 1986 clearly these cuts are part of an administration strategy to balance the budget while at the same time increasing defense expenditures and cutting taxes at one time it was charged that such a feat could only be accomplished with mirrors we now know that it is possible to achieve these goals without mirrorsby taking billions of dollars out of the social security system i am confident that the congress will not permit this to happen there is a shortterm social security financing problem but it can be resolved by allowing the three social security funds to borrow from each other we can also permit the trust funds to borrow from the treasury particularly during times of high unemployment when contributions to the system dwindle the longrange financing problem if it ever develops must be addressed through partial general revenue funding of social security this was forseen by social securitys original sponsors in the 1930s it may be inevitable and it is certainly preferable to cutting benefits i have always favored this approach after all the wellbeing of our senior citi zens is certainly worthy of funding by the treasury these general revenue dollars are tax dollars which come out of the pockets of each and every one of us here we have an administration which is willing to spend billions and billions on the pentagonwith no conoern for costbut which shrinks in horror at the thought of using our tax revenues to pay social security benefits i trust that the congress will not be bamboozled into enacting these illconsidered and punitive proposals by the administrations talk about averting the bankruptcy of the social security system that system cannot and will not be allowed to go bankrupt the administration must understand that cutting benefits does not solve the problem of social security financing on the contrary cuts in benefits are the very disasters we must work to avoid i will fight these proposals and will do what i can to see that the social security system remains on a sound footing without unfair and regressive cuts a balanced budget is a desirable goal but a budget that is balanced on the backs of senior citizens is a travesty the reagan cuts in social security benefits must be rejected"], [0.09767550230026245, 0.9023244976997375, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i want to associate myself with the gentlemans remarks i oppose the amendment president reagans proposal for massive increases in military spending over the next 5 years threatens the security of the entire world if approved by congress these proposals would destabilize our economy erode our defense alliances and accelerate the arms race the presidents defense budget is founded on the unrealistic assumption that an ever more powerful preemptive military force is the key to p secure defense this policy can only lead us toward war i believe that national security and world peace depend on economic strength nuclear disarmament and conventional arms limitations and cooperative international defense agreements the presidents program would undermine these objectives and thus threaten our real national security our nations armed forces must be fully equipped welltrained and thoroughly prepared and i would support a defense budget which would insure this but the presidents proposal greatly exceeds what is needed to maintain such a force he suggests funding for unreasonably expensive nuclear weapons programs such as the mx missile program for unreliable and unproven equipment such as the xm1 tank and for nuclear weapons that would increase the potential for a nuclear conflict such as the pershing and cruise ii missiles the presidents defense budget wastes badly needed federal revenue on a dangerous policy of military buildup the president hopes to more than double military expenditures from 173 9 billion in 1981 to 374 3 billion in 1986 a jump in defense allotments from 24 7 to 37 6 percent of the total federal budget in fiscal 1982 alone he plans a 15percent increase over 1981 to an estimated total obligational authority of 222 2 billion defense spending will be significantly higher still according to the congressional budget office which found the presidents inflation estimates for the 4 outyears to be low cbo determined that defense will cost 6 4 billion more in fiscal year 1982 that the president projects for 1986 defense spending would shoot up to at least 50 billion above the figure the president projects ceo estimates these unanticipated costs would have to be absorbed by the pentagon forcing cuts in programs the presidents proposals clearly exhibit poor economic planning increased dependence on the military budget will force inflation up rapidly and make it vitually impossible for our civilian economy to recover this impact will couple with the presidents proposed tax cuts to worsen our current economic instability i want to remind my colleagues that a similar policy of steeply increased military outlays together with unwillingness to raise tax rates during the vietnam war is primarily responsible for our current runaway inflation abroad the administration is urging out allies to adopt similar policies of expanded military might the presidents stated intention to embark on massive military stockpiling as well as the state departments growing pressure on allies to undertake simultaneous buildups already is beginning to strain unitedstates relations with several nations this policy is raising the risks involved in all international conflicts which might develop no matter how small the damage to our civilian economy which the presidents proposals would do poses a serious threat to national security by weakening the nations fiscal and economic role in the world under his plan we would be caught in a whirlpool of military spending that would drain our economy of its ability to provide social fiscal and military security if we are to be successful at bringing about an economic recovery we must reprogram some of these increases in defense spending toward human services an other civilian activities in the reagan military budget 75 percent of the planned defense increases above president carters proposals for 1982 are targeted for procurement of new weapons systems this would mean that a total of 68 5 billion will be committed to procurement contracts in fiscal year 1982 but much of that money will not actually be spent until 1984 or later when those contracts take effect this largescale lockup of funds will cause a sudden inflation jump by limiting available funds without producing consumable commodities a strong domestic economy cannot be achieved until the economy is made substantially less reliant on military expenditures military spending is a relatively poor stimulus for creating jobs and adds to inflation rather than helping to control it one billion dollars spent on mass transportation would create approximately 26 000 more jobs than the same amount spent on the mx missile system according to the council on economic priorities about the same advantage exists for money spent to create teaching jobs as compared to using it to generate military production this xegative effect of military outlays is worsened by the fact that many of the jobs generated by milltary spending are shortterm temporary positions that actually interfere with longterm resolution of our current employment problems the demands which largescale milltary spending put on competition for scarce resources such as highly skilled technicians and engineers and its upward impact on inflation will prevent the civilian sector from obtaining the resources it sorely needs for growth an artificial competitive advantage is created for militaryrelated industries in obtaining scarce resources by the dominant role pentagon expenditures play in our economy yet a disproportionately small quantity of commodities returns to our civilian economy military increases come at the cost of vital federal programs that serve basic human needs programs that feed people for example will be cut by almost 5 billion and funds for public service employment would be eliminated to save 4 8 billion the inequity of these budget priorities cannot be overlooked macroeconomic studies support the examnples i have given of how the presidents military budget proposals would undermine efforts to improve the economy the world bank and the unitedstates arms control agency for example compiled data which showed that steppedup military spending tends to weaken national economies the study compared the percent of gnp used for military purposes to the growth in manufacturing productivity in seven industrialized nations for the years 196077 those nations which used relatively large portions of their gnp for defense such as the united states generally had lowgrowth rates japan for example gave the lowest gnp percentage to defense ninetenths of 1 percent and had by far the highest annual growth rate 8 8 percent at the other end of the scale the united states put 7 6 percent of its gnp toward defense and had the second lowest growth rate at only 3 4 percent annually i believe the united states faces continued severe economic stagnation as a result of growing military spending historically the policy of the united states has been to develop cooperative defense strategies with ita allies to insure international and domestic security we currently are involved in some 29 formal agreements the nato alliance most prominent among them the nato alliance provides the democratic world with a significant margin of international security both in number of strategic weapons and in strategic planning capability nato countries outspent warsaw pact nations during the 1970s by 207 billion on military goods and possess 3 200 more strategic nuclear weapons a renewed commitment to natoprovided security by the united states and our european allies would create a cheaper and less dangerous world situation than would a unitedstates initiated worldwide arms buildup arms control measures and disarmanent agreements offer an important longterm approach to mutual security and international peace the salt 11 process brought us close to a reasonable check against further nuclear expansion this agreement should be ratified it is a necessary step toward disarmament although salt ii itself falls far short of real disarmament negotiations for reductions in european theater nuclear forces merit strong unitedstates support west german chancellor helmut schmidt recently proposed a freeze on the deployment of our europeanbased pershing 11 and cruise missiles pending negotiations for mutual reductions among nato and warsaw pact nations these missiles clearly increase the risk of a nuclear attack on europe both soviet and unitedstates officials already have give attention to a comprehensive test ban for nuclear weapons that would open a direct avenue to a nuclear weapons freeze negotiations on such a ban should be continued substantial reductions can be made in the presidents proposals for the military budget in five areas without weakening unitedstates defense funding for programs that increase our nuclear weapons stockpile those which simply generate repetitive weaponry weapons which the administration plans to produce even though testing on them is either incomplete or indicates significant problems the tremendously expensive mx missile system and generally the elimination of widespread waste in defense programs production of the trident submarine americas most expensive nuclear weapon in production at a projected 1982 cost of 1 6 billion is one of the unnecessary weapons in the presidents budget the tomahawk cruise maissile which threatens to undermine future arms control measures could be eliminated at a savings of 391 million for fiscal 1982 as well the european theater nuclear forces which i mentioned earlier are budgeted for 932 million for 1982 these missile systems would create a substantial offensive nuclear threat to the soviet union and further polarize the alreadytense european situation antiballistic missiles which would violate slt 1 could be eliminated and thus save 438 million without reducing unitedstates security there are several cases of repetitive weaponry in the current military budget these include the cx airlift planes which the administration plans to begin development of at~ a cost of 250 million for fiscal year 1982 even though the similar c5 transport is not yet fully operational due to production and operating problems f14 and f15 fighter planes which last year received a higher authorization from congress than the pentagon requested are scheduled to receive an additional 2 4 billion but these planes would provide no significant new cappbilities the extremely costly and controversial xm1 battle tank is prematurely budgeted for production at 2 billion in the reagan 1982 budget the reliability and durability of the xm1 was called into serious question both by a department of defense appointed panel of technical experts and by a gao study both investigations expressed doubt that the tank was ready for production the mx missile system is probably the greatest boondoggle of the military budget estimated for fiscal 1982 at 2 9 billion this controversial weapons system is likely to coast more than 100 billion before it is finished possibly as soon as 1986 military experts many citizens and several members of congress have questioned the feasibility and advisability of the proposed landbasing mode for the mx and no alternatives have yet been seriously explored yet the president is actively pursuing deployment of the mx of equally great concern is the direct threat the mx would create to soviet security forcing escalation of the arms race undermining arms limitation talks and substantially increasing world tensions if the president were truly interested in eliminating waste from the oovernmient no department deserves closer scrutiny than the defense department omb director david stockman recently told a congressional committee that pentagon waste was widespread but the administration has thus far avoidcd making cuts there several investigations documented waste in the pentagon in eight major areas one recent investigation of pentagon waste found that a minimum estimate of the cost of military waste is put at 15 billion a year the sources of waste are in many areas of the military and the problem clearly is pervasive needless purchases of goods already in stock performance of unnecessary operations and poor supervision contribute several billion dollars of waste of materials equipment and fuel one study found a complicated overlapping management system among the four branches of the armed services causes costly repetition of equipment maintenance base supervision and other services generating massive amounts of waste"], [0.09932070970535278,

since the rnid1960s has been the attainmient of equal access to health care that is access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these

mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid

under 65 years of age the tax credit for the elderly is only available to those uinder 65 receiving a pension under a public retirement system as in the eavse for taxpayers 65 or over the miaximum

one group of early retirees be singled out for favorable tax treatmnent increasingly participants in private pension plans are seeking early retirement there is no reason to expect that their needs in retirement will be any different from those of public retirees they should be treated the same by our federal income tax laws second if these public retirees under age 65 do nut earn income they do not have to reduce the base for computing the credit even if their adjusted gross income exceeds the levels applicable to taxpayers age 65 and over this gives public retirees under age 65 ain advantage over taxpayers age 65 and over who do not have earnied income my bill h r 38 eliminates these inequities since it has no age and income level limitations and it does not restrict its

incomes the hardest and many older amevricans live on fixed incomes increases in the cost of housing food medical care and transportation are particularly hard on them i feel strongly that a basic

some concern with this section the gentlewoman raises some very valid questions and concerns dealing with section 414 the committees intention by including this provision in the bill was twofold the first objective was to place some uniformity upon overtime payments for agencies funded in this bill currently different agencies funded in the bill have varying cutoff points above which overtime is not paid the committee felt these levels should be more uniform and believed that the proviision would accomplish that in addition the limitation would result in not insignificant savings although it is hard to determine precisely the amount of overtime which might be paid to gslos and above in 1982 a rough estimate would be approximately 5 million however let me assure the gentlewoman from ohio and this committee that the appropriations committee did not intend to cause serious problems with this general provision it has come to our attention that the interpretation of certain sections of the fair labor standards act would require revision if the provision is adopted in this form section 213 of that act states that within the government service administrative executive and professional employees are exempt from the overtime provision of the fair labor standards act an office of personnel management regulation details which specific classifications and grades are considered nonexempt under the actand thus due overtime pay for additional work the committees provision as reported in the bill would require certain revisions to that regulation in addition certain people have questioned the effect of the overtime provision on health care within the veterans administration health system and upon responses to disasters under the federal emergency management agency the committee certainly does not intend for the overtime provision to impair in any way va health care or fema disaster relief responses the appropriations committee will review these issues very carefully and make appropriate adjustments in conference with the senate i thank the gentlewoman for her concern in this area"], [NaN, NaN, 1, "since the presidents state of the union address i have tried as a member of the budget committee to temper any reaction or criticism of the presidents budget until additional details were revealed my hope was that the president and the administration would understand that there can be no budget resolution this year unless it is balanced and fair this years budget must not only stress the need for budget discipline in all areas but also address the immediate problems of unemployment and recession the state of the union address unfortunately failed to reflect the need for balance and discipline in all areasii1140 stressing additional cuts in domestic programs and not touching areas like defense or a reconsideration of the tax cut in todays washington post there is additional confirmation that the administration is taking the same onesided approach that it took last yearaiming the budget ax at the very same americans already hard hit by last years reductionsthe elderly the needy children and students and the unemployed again the burden of budget cuts will fall entirely on those who are least able to afford it particularly at a time of serious recession enough is enough if it is not clear to the administration yet then let them understand that this congress the american people will not and cannot be so callous as to enact a budget resolution that is so incredibly unfair and unbalanced as one member of the budget committee i will refuseand i believe other members of this congress will refuseto again consider multibilliondollar cuts in health care for the elderly in nutrition for children in education benefits for students in job training for the unemployed without even considering the possibility of reductions in defense increases and modifications in the 750 billion tax cuts yesterdays increase in the prime rate is just one more sign of the inherent weakness of a program that is producing and justifying huge deficits for a narrow set of priorities that do not relate to the real needs of people ln our society it is my firm belief that there must be a balanced and fair approach to the budget resolution this year or there may well be no budget resolution this year"], [NaN, NaN, 1, "gen david c jones is retiring
