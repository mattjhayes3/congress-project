proposed white amendment being added to the judiciary committee amendment both amendments are feared by the department of defense just when has it arisen that the judiciary committee and the armed services committee suddenly have a wisdom greater than the department that they are saddling these impossible programs to be carried out with i would like to read to you from the testimony given on behalf of the unitedstates department of defense on june 3 1981 by the general counsel of the department of defense william h taft iv esq here is what he said the position of the department of defense on the proposed legislation is characterized by two overriding considerations first the mission of the department of defense is military preparedness assistance to law enforcement agencies should be provided only when incidental to the performance of the departments mission what is he trying to tell the subcommittee second the department is sensitive to the historic separation between military and civilian spheres of activity this distinction is embodied in the posse comitatus act 18 unitedstatesc 1385incidentally a criminal statutewhich generally prohibits military participation in civilian law enforcement with limited exceptions what are those exceptions an emergency the governor of a state declores he can no longer maintain law and order an invasion by a foreign enemy the quelling of a domestic insurrection against the government mr taft goes on to say preservation of this distinction is one of the most fundamental precepts of our form of government this is not the american civil liberties union speaking but the department of defense sensitive to its obligations then mr taft goes on to review what happened in the senate which was a tragedy as far as the defense department was concerned and so he again expresses the point iterated previously there is another important consideration before we vote on this matter mr taft notes thatmembers of the armed forces put in long arduous duty hours in furtherance of the training and operation necessary for military preparedness military readiness is further enha~ced by eliminating performance on nornilitary tasks by members of the armed forces in order to provide increased time for military training assignment of military personnel to civilian law enforcement duties would be contrary to the goal of military preparedness because civilian operations are not an adequate substitute for military training this is the department of defense the pentagon is telling us that they cannot conduct these operations effectively because to do so would deter from its military preparedness mr taft concludes by stating thatsuch operations normally cannot replicate the training necessary to meet military contingencies

opposition to the amendment to substitute procurement of the 747 aircraft for the c5b but i also rise to speak against one system of doing defense business here on capitol hill that has done so i uch

for the taxpaying public the major questions before us ought to be what is our military need and what is the best way of balancing defense capabilities with costs to meet that need in my opinion the facts most relevant to these central issues are first almost all parties who have seriously examined the subjectinctluding both congressional armed services committeesconclude that the united states is faced with a severe shortage of military airlift particularly in the field of outsize cargo such as helicopters tanks armored fighting vehicles and artillery second under every likely military scenario the proposed c5b fleet would deliver more combat power than the b747 in the critical first 20 days of an emergency and because of its outsize cargo capabilities the c5b would afford far more flexibility to defense planners in responding to changing circumstances third with regard to cost effectiveness the air force has concluded that the 20year lifecycle expenses of a comparable fleet of c5bs and b747s yields a cost advantage to the latter of less than 1 billion furthermore the c5b fleet was found to be 25 percent more effective which reflects in part the fact that the 747 fleet would in the words of general hecker do nothing to alleviate the current and pressing need for outsize airlift capability fourth finally during the present period of maximum budget austerity the b747 procurement would cost 2 billion more over the next 3 years than would the c5b in summary the c5b would respond more adequately to the actual military requirement for outsize cargo airlift with only a marginal cost penalty in the long run and a sizable cost advantage in the near term none of this is meant to disparage the 747 nor to downplay the contribution that it can make toward meeting our national defense mobility needs in fact the 747 is a very fine aircraft which though designed as a passenger carrier can be adapted to military usage it is this dual civilianmilitary capability

pledges to initiate disarmament discussions freer flow of trade and a recognition of basic human rights for all the peoples of the world it was the human rights declaration that raised the hopes of

that the navy has begun to build the radio station in key west fla even though congress has not yet authorized one penny of the funding necessary for this project the administrations blatant

to the cuban people this administration plans to use it as an instrument to encourage revolt on that island i wish to remind my colleagues that the united states exhorted the hungarian people to revolt against communism in the fall of 1956 yet the united states refuse their urgent requests for military aid when the soviet union invaded hungary and ruthlessly repressed the uprising as a result many hungarians lost their lives believing the united states would support their struggle i am certain the same fate awaits any cuban who may be deceived by radio marti broadcast into believing that the united states would send troops into cuba to support a popular uprising clearly radio martis primary and only purpose is to decrease the propaganda gap which exists between the united states and russia currently the soviets outspend the united states about 7 to 1 in their broadcasting and information efforts around the world surely the congress cannot justify taking school lunches away from children cutting health care programs for the elderly and diminishing services for the handicapped and at the same time authorize moneys for a propaganda contest with the soviets by opposing the

is not only tieing up financial resources of the local organizations but also is tying up the courts furthermore legislative remedy has been sought to in more than one session of congress resulting in debates among members such as that occuring today my colleague the distinguished gentleman from ohio has proposed simply placing a moratorium on ftc activities with respect to stateregulated

welcome this opportunity to use this bill as a vehicle for securing house action on this vital issue in supporting this amendment we are not proposing to exempt doctors from ftc jurisdiction and thus create a privileged class above the law but rather to halt the expansion of ftc powers with respect to stateregulated professionals until congress can determine whether it is in fact within the ftcs jurisdiction to do so opponents of this amendment argue that removal of the ftc will result in a vacuum of power to regulate these professionals but i must argue the contrary the state and local professional societies serve a viable role in monitoring professional practices providing for peer review and in the establishment of standards of quality and performanceand the enforcement of those standards if the luken amendment is not passed the overriding issue will more than likely be whether or not ftc regulations have been violated rather than one of whether or not the patient was wellserved the state boards and local societies have oversight in these cases and the patient will be the ultimate loser if questionable medical care escapes the criticism and corrective action of their peers another amendment has been offered to h r 6995 which proposes to grant ftc the authority to regulate antitrust practices of professionals the assumption here seems to be that one can separate qualityofcare from professional ethics well i dont helieve that you can i dont believe that someone would patronize a doctor with low prices but terrible carepractices nor vice versa this seems to be just one more attempt to usurp the power already granted to the states to regulate and oversee professional practices i do not believe the professional groups want to remove themselves

exceed 125 billion of this total more than 25 billion is delinquent agency efforts to collect these delinquent debts have been appallingly poor agency managers simply do not care about collections and it is this lack of interest that had produced the large volume of receivables management has been so loose that a recent review of debt programs located 10 billion in debts that had not previously been reported it is hard to lose track of 10 billion but the government managed to do it i do not have to tell my colleagues how important this money could be if we had even a small percentage of the delinquent debt we would be able to avoid billions of dollars in spending cuts or to fund a sizeable tax cut the members may be aware that the president announced a major effort to strengthen federal credit management about a month ago at that time the director of the office of management and budget indicated that a package of legislative recommendations would be proposed although that legislative package has yet to be sent to the congress i am pleased that the committee on government operations has been able to take prompt action on debt collection well before the president ever recommended any legislation chairman jack brooks had already introduced his own debt collection bill and this is the bill that we are debating today i would like to commend chairman brooks for his leadership in this area i hope that the administration will be able to follow up on the work we have started and will submit additional legislation soon the major purpose of h r 2811 is to clarify the law relating to credit reporting by federal agencies under a justice department interpretation of the privacy act credit bureaus accepting credit information from an agency would be subject to the privacy act in addition to the fair credit reporting act h r 2811 overturns this interpretation and leaves credit bureaus subject only to the fair credit reporting act the credit industry supports the bill the reporting of delinquent debts to credit bureaus should encourage debtors to pay what they owe the governnient it is hard to say how effective this reporting will be in reducing the amount of delinquencies but it may help if only a tiny fraction of those who owe money are induced to pay collections will be many millions of dollars h r 2811 also specifies the steps that an agency must take prior to reporting of debts these due process procedures assure that individuals are informed of their rights and of the consequences of failure to pay the procedures will be simple for agencies to comply with and will provide adequate protection for individuals information in the possession of credit bureaus is already protected by the fair credit reporting act in addition the bill further amends the privacy act to permit increased sharing of credit information among federal lending agencies the bill also requires that information about agency collection activities be included in the yearly budget message this reporting will enable congress to monitor collections by making information available in a timely fashion to the budget and appropriation committees finally the bill requires agency in spectors general to review annually major debt programs independent reviews will stop agencies from hiding collection failures through creative accounting techniques current agency accounting systems are incapable of supporting needed debt collection functions in offering this bill today i would like to emphasize that legislation will not solve the debt collection problems of the federal government delinquent debts have soared because of a lack of management interest in collections the report of the omb debt collection project documents this point over and over again the report ackhowledges that the first step in assuring effective management of debt is the establishment of accountability at all levels of the process it is difficult if not impossible to legislate management responsibility the shortcomings of legislation are illustrated by the experience with public law 94466 the veterans rehabilitation and education amendments of 1980 gave the veterans administration new authority to collect debts included was the authority to report information on delinquent debtors to credit bureaus this is essentially the same authority that h r 2811 proposes to extend to other agencies at a recent hearing the va admitted that 6 months after this law was enacted no debts had been reported to credit bureaus further the va indicated that the necessary computer capacity would not be available until 1982 this means that the aggressive new collection authority may go unused for 2 or more years after it was granted notwithstanding this experience i still strongly endorse the granting of similar authority to other agencies the administration has promised to strengthen credit management practices and has ordered agency heads to develop and implement aggressive debt collection programs the president has also ordered each agency to designate an official with responsibility and authority for debt collection with this highlevel commitment i hope that adequate resources will be made available to do the job if nothing else the designation of these officials will help to identify those who are at fault for inadequate collections in the future although the administration has announced a major effort on debt colleclion it has established very modest goals at a hearing before the subcommittee on government information and individual rights omb director edwin harper indicated that management efforts and new legislation would only enable the administration to in crease collections of delinquent debts by 1 billion this represents only 4 percent of the total amount of delinquent debt presently outstanding this is a very limited objective for an administration that has been so vocal on eliminating fraud abuse and waste it is nevertheless welcome as a first step and i hope that much larger sums will be collected in future years as offered today h r 2811 includes some technical changes to the bill as reported by the committee on government operations one of the amendments made by the committee permits disclosure of credit information by one federal lending agency to another federal lending agency the purpose of the amendment is to overcome privacy act limitations that preclude agency exchange of information where the purpose of the disclosure is not compatible with the purpose for which information was originally collected where credit history information has been collected for use in one loan program disclosure of that information for use in an unrelated loan program fails to meet the compatibility requirement of the privacy act as reported by the committee disclosure of information by one federal lending agency to another would be permitted under the same conditions as are required for disclosure to a consumer reporting agency since these conditions are unnecessary for euchanges of data within the federal government they have been eliminat ed in the bill offered today these changes have been agreed to by the minority the three conditions that remain in the bill as a prerequisite to agencytoagency disclosure are first a require ment that the disclosure be included in the privacy act notice for the system of records second a require ment that the individual be notifiedthat information may be disclosed to another federal lending agency and third a limitation on the type of information that can be disclosed the first and third of these conditions are identical to conditions required for disclosure to a consufer reporting agency the notice requirement is similar to a requirement for such disclosures and can be satisfied through the privacy act notice already required under subsection e 3 in summary h r 2811 will encourage more effective collection of debts by

project the administrations blatant circumvention of the legislatively defined appropriations process is reason enough to oppose the radio broadcasting to cuba act contrary to radio martis stated purpose to provide accurate information to the cuban people this administration plans to use it as an instrument to encourage revolt on that island i wish to remind my colleagues that the united states exhorted the hungarian people to revolt against communism in the fall of 1956 yet the united states refuse their urgent requests for military aid when the soviet union invaded hungary and ruthlessly repressed the uprising as a result many hungarians lost their lives believing the united states would support their struggle i am certain the same fate awaits any cuban who may be deceived by radio marti broadcast into believing that the united states would send troops into cuba to support a popular uprising clearly radio martis primary and only purpose is to decrease the propaganda gap which exists between the united states and russia currently the soviets outspend the united states about 7 to 1 in their broadcasting and information efforts around the world surely the congress cannot justify taking school lunches away from children cutting health care programs for the elderly and diminishing services for the handicapped and at the same time authorize moneys for a propaganda contest with the soviets by opposing the passage of h r 5427 the house would prevent the allocation of federal funds to a futile and impotent program and thereby reject the ideological whims of president reagan i urge strongly that the measure be defeated"], [NaN, NaN, 1, "the late will rogers once made a statement that i think will be very fitting for us to keep in mind as we get into the debate and eventual passage of the 1981 farm bill he said it aint really peoples ignorance that bothers me so much its them knowing so much that aint so thats the problem now i submit that there are going to be three areas we are going to get into on the farm bill in wvhich a lot of us are going to be talking about things that are just not so one is in the area of the budget that the farmn bill is an expensive bill when we look at the very real fact that the 1972 farm budget was 5 3 billion we should remember that the budget th~at we are passing this year is 4 5 billion now i would defy any other agency of the federal government or any other proponent of a bill that will come before this house to say that they are living within those standards also with regard to the fact that this particular bill is going to be over the 1982 budget it is a fact that after we get through passing the amendments to be offered by the gentleman from iowa we will be within the budget so any argument that we will be outside the budget will not be factual the second group of attacks we will have on the farm bill will come from those cheapfood advocates who have been present in this house since 1952 and who refuse to recognize and acknowledge that the american people are eating better on less percent of their income than the people of any other country in the world if we continue to contend that that is not a fact i will suggest that those days are going to be numbered in which we will"]]}
