alb is a thirdclass plane with a firstclass price tag study after study and report after report shows we are not getting our moneys worth the f alb is siphoning precious dollars away from vital defense systems the money we are wasting on the f alb could be put to much better use the amendment which i am offering is long overdue my amendment would prohibit the use of any authorized funds for the procurement research development testing and evaluation of the f alb it does not delete any funds the money targeted for the p alb would be available for other aircraft programs which meet our real defense needs this amendment addresses a pentagon pipedream of a souped up super technological fighter which is hidden in a hazy world of misplaced priorities and misplaced loyalties to a plane rather than to the defense of these united states these loyalties moreover are to a plane that does not stand the test of its original promise orprojections in 1975 congress approved a lowcost lowperformance alternative for the navy and marine corps this was the f alb today we have a high cost lowperformance edsel hidden in a smokescreen thrown up by dod but even through the smokescreen we can see one thing risingthe exorbitant costs for the f alb it is not as if there arc no alternatives to the p a18 one part of the defense smokescreen consists of stonewalling by the department one year ago congress heard the plaintive voice of dod proclaim that there were no alternatives to fulfill the four roles envisioned for the f alb since then the marine corps has eagerly embraced the av8b the light attack role while the navy has gladly accepted a policy of f14 squadrons for all its big deck aircraft carriers there are two roles remaining for the f ala the navy light attack and the marine corps fighter but once again dod is wailing that there are no alternatives available in the best traditions of stonewalling the navy has even gone so far as to deny that it has conducted studies of f alb alternatives however i have in hand three studies conducted by the navy on alternatives to the p ala studies which indicate that the alternatives are not only feasible but preferable let me quote from these socalled nonexistent navy studies on the light attack mission one study states the f18 represents major degradation in our attack capability as compared to present aircraft with f18s designed payload 4 rockeycs a7 radius of action is twice as far with four times the f18s design load the a6 radius of action is twice as far many targets that might be critical could not be reached with fis for targets that the fi8 could reach its smaller payload would require more attack aircraft exposure to enemy defenses although the fpis is faster in a fighter configuration than either a6 or a7 it is not supersonic nor significantly faster when carrying weapons and if adequate fuel is provided to allow the fl8 to leave the target at supersonic speeds after weapon delivery the f18s usable weapon payload is even further degraded this same report addresses the marine fighter mission and says the remaining prospective f18 mission is the marine corps fighter mission since the p14 is probably more capable than is necessary for the classic marine corps air defense mission the f18 appears an adequate replacement for marine f4s however the tradeoff is between providing the f14 and greater fighter capability versus providing a less capable av8b3 fighter variant that would offer support logistic advantages plus the tactical advantages of an allvstoi marine corps fighter and lightattack force the navy would still like to claim that the f alb is essential to the future effectiveness of the navy and marine corps but their own analysis reveals that the analyses of alternative aircraft procurement strategies recently forwarded by cnm chief of naval material to cno chief of naval operations show that the navy can more fully satisfy its aircraft requirements and more rapidly build up toward 15 air wings if the f18 is cancelled 11 4448 co and a7s or a6s used for the navy attack aircraft the effectiveness analysis shows that it would also result in a more effective force it is difficult to make a case on cost or effectiveness grounds for continuance of the p18 program in further unqualified support of the f ala the f alb program manager admitted at a recent press conference that the f14 was a better fighter than the f ala and that the a6 was a better attack plane the prime rationale for the f alb is not the aircrafts necessity rather the department of defense supports the f ala because of its supposed affordability i submit to my colleagues that nearly anything is affordable at 40 billion our military personnel could have calvin klein designer uniforms at that price but i doubt if it would enhance our defense capabilities are we to allow the navy and the department of defense to continue their spendthrift ways on the f ala and bankrupt other more essential naval programs the problems with this plane are many it has a limited radius half that of the a7 the acceleration threshold had to be reduced to meet the planes true capabilities it has not yet completed the mandated two lifetime fatigue test nor have the alloys added to the engine as a result of a crash been tested however these problems significant in any other plane pale in comparison to the continued cost escalation of the f a18 this aircraft was originally purchased because it was supposed to give us the quantity of aircraft the navy needs it was supposed to be a low cost daylightonly aircraft the f a18 got its first taste of megabucks with the addition of radar missiles in 1974 since then the addiction of the navy to goldplating has taken hold of the f ala aircraft however the navy is now showing selfrestraint recent costcutting measures for the f ala include the substitution of aluminum for silver in the detonating cords to explode the canopy i am glad but surprised that only aluminum will suffice with a near 40 billion price tag i would have thought that the cords should have been made of gold to match the plane with spending of this sort is it any wonder that the program has grown in cost so that despite an increase in the quantity of the dod purchase the unit cost has doubled in 5 years the navy claims that the cost growth is strictly due to inflation however this claim simply does not stand the test of careful analysis recently most members received information comparing program costs of the f ala to those of its contemporary the f16 this information demonstrated that the f a18s costs have increased nearly three times as much as the f18s the f alb and the fl6 had contract awards 4 months apart in 1975"],

devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"], [0.00024455785751342773, 0.9997554421424866,

our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure and may someday this country be blessed with another leader as bold as caring as great and as determined as he was

talking about almost doubling it in the year 1986 to shock the members in a different way in the decade of the 1970s this country and many of us served in the house during the seventies we spent 1 trillion on the military function in the first 5 years of the 1980s we are anticipating spending between 1 3 to 1 5 trillion with cost overruns and what have you it is conceivable in the first 5 years of the 1980s our military budget expenditure could exceed 2 trillion if we project that out to the year 1990 it is clear by most con~servative figures that this country will be spending between 2v2 trillion and maybe 2 7 trillion or 2 8 trillion so in a 10year period we are talking about more than doubling close to tripling the military budget now the qu tion that the average citizen in this country ought to be asking is how do you finance this large substantial sustained increase~ in the military budget members of the committee there are really only three ways you can do it either you go to the american people and you say that the nature of the world is so frighten ing so dangerous so unstable that we must now askthie american people for new taxes in order to finance this incredible burden but not one politician in this body the other body or down at the other end of pennsylvania avenue is actually advocating levying new taxes to finance this increase so let us throw that out as an option the second alternative is to engage in substantial budg6t deficit spending but this administration has trapped itself in the rhetoric of the balanced budget it cannot insult my intellect nor the intellect of the american people by suggesting that a democratlc party budget deficit is inflationary and a republican party deficit is not inflationary we know that is absurd so to engage in deficit sepending is a travesty they have t6 show by the next election that they had moved toward a balanced budget or they have lost credibility so they cannot engage in deficit spending for any substantial period of time to finance this incredible increase in this military budget to 367 lbillion by fiscal year 1986 so what is the third alternative the third alternative is to reach into the nonmilitary side of the budget and engage in substantial cuts in order to finance this incredible increase in the military budget and that is the assertion that i make on the floor this afternoon this administration suggested a budget authority cut of 48 4 billion on the nonmilitary side and led the american people to believe that we are reducing federal expenditures a couple of weeks later you make a budget schedule that increases the military budget by 53 3 billion that has to be a wash the argument that i assert aggressively is that these budget cuts are not designed to fight inflation our own congressional budget office indicated that cutting 2 5 billion from the budget would only reduce the inflation rate by between 0 1 and 0 2 of 1 percent so what is this all about it is about financing an increase in the military budget which becomes the least politically risky and the safest way to do it because levying taxes has political implications engaging in continued budget deficits has political implications but ripping off the poor ripping off workingclass people ripping off senior citizens ripping off the children and middleincome citizens of america is becoming the safest way to engage in financing military budgets the american people need to desperately understand that is what this is all about so the question then becomes is there a rationale for the expenditures and for this incredible amount of money i do not believe so and later in this debate we will be making a significant argument that challenges the assumptions of those who perceive the prob lems of the world as being military problems that can be solved in a military fashion there are those of us in this body who frankly and legitimately believe that the problem of the 1980s bring new imperatives call for new policies there are 160 nations in the world many of them eager for freedom and to simplylook through the narrow confines of the parochial prism of united statessoviet ideological relations is an absurdity we have to begin to look at the economic social and political realities of human mnisery in the world and that does not dictate this incredible expenditure of the military budget to rip off millions of human beings who have a right in a free and open democratic society to believe that their government would not abandon them should not be the people upon whose back we build an incredible military machine there have been a number of economists who have pointed out that there are really only two ramifications for going down this road either we bankrupt this

which accompanied the committee report on the resolution in which i was joined by the gentleman from illinois those viewvs are as followvs sepaate and dissenting virws of hon geonge e danielson and hon henny j hydez i do not agree with the action of thc judiciary committee in reporting the bill flouse joint resolution 220 favorably to the house of representatives i regret that it is necessary to stand in opposition to legislation which is emotionally and politically charged and which appeals to the humanitarian instincts and principles which we all share this opposition can easily be misunderstood or misconstrue to reflect a lack of appreciation for the heroic acts of a fine person under the most difficult of circumstances my opposition is based on other most fundamental considerations i perceive and i cherish american citizenship as the highest honor that our country can confer upon a person who is a citizen of another land the granting of that citizenship is the admission and welcoming of thati person into our national family it mnust not be lightly bestowed and the granting of it certainly should never be used as an acknowledgement of appreciation for in doing so we would be diminishing and demeaning the citizenship of those of us who have bfeen born to this land and to the millions before us who have supported the principles we stand for and have fought and died to fireserve for our country our founding fathers considered citizenship important enough to provide in our constitution that no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at tlie time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of presidvrnt as members of the congress we all have had cases brought to our attention of persons who have come here as immigrants aind sought to become naturalized citizens but who because of some past transgression or technicality have been unable to qualify and many of us have used our efforts through private legislation and otherwise to assist those people who have done everything within their power to become american citizens as i have reviewed this legislation i have experienced a feeling of pride in mr wallenbergs fine work he was a swedish citizen all of my ancestors were swedish and i suppose that that ethnic kinship should evoke in me some special feeling of affinity with him it does but not enough to dhminish by one whit the importance of anerican citizenship as i perceive it and i am not alone in perceiving ani rican citizenship as something not to be treated lightly that feeling has been shared by millions of americans our capitol building of which we are so proud was decorated in large part by a naturalized american citizen an italian immigrant named constantino brumidi those who know and love the capitol know and cherish the memory of brumidi brumidi spent most of his life painting the senate wing of the capitol the capitol dome and some other areas the most cherished thing in his life was his american citizenship one of his paintings is the feature of the members private dining room and is signed c brumidi artist citizen of the unitedstates lbrumidi regarded his american citizenship with the greatest of pride and with him i agree our history is replete with instances of fine people who did a great deal for our country yet to them we have not extended american citizenship the marquis de lafayette helped us achieve our independence 200 years ago in his case as in that of our founding fathers he pledged to america his life his fortune and his sacred honor yet we did not grant him american citizenship and then there was casimir pulaski who was also prominent in the american revolution did we extend him american citizenship how about those who have been awarded the congressional medal of honor the highest tangible award that our country can give which is awarded only for bravery above and heyond the call of duty i have been informed that not all of the more than 3 400 who received this medal were american citizens have we conveyed american citizenship upon them i experienced a feeling of pride that mr wallenberg devised a safe conduct passport to make it possible for those whom he helped to escape from hitlers terror it was a remarkable procedure though not without precedent history remembers that during the years immediately after world war i thirty yearsbefore wallenberg another scandinavian the great fridtjof nansen of norway devised a similar passport known historically as the nansen passport to enable many victims of the turkish genocide of the armenian people to escape from the middle east and emigrate to other areas including the united states where many of them today are american citizens some of the cider refugees from that first holocaust have shown me with pride their nansen passports to america we have not made fridtjof nansen an american citizen in the argument favoring the granting of citizenship in this case it was recalled that the united states once granted honorary american citizenship to winston churchill that in fact was the one and only situation in which an honorary american citizenship has ever been granted the importance and intensity of mr churchills relationship to the united states during the period of world war 11 is common kiiowledge and if anyone ever earned honorary citizenship it would have been churchill also churchilli mother was an american citizen which is a significant added factor and in addition he had consented to receiving the honor despite those facts if i had been here in the congress at that time i would not have voted for his honorary citizenship the history of world war ii and its aftermath is filled with the stories of heroic actions by people guided by humanitarian principles we should commend them we should revere them we should remember them and their deeds and we should try to emulate them but that does not mean that we must give away american citizenship to those people i am sure that mr wallenberg was proud of his swedish citizenship as all of us are proud of our american citizenship and i also believe that mr wallenberg did not have need of an additional honorary citizenship to make himself whole any more than any of us feel the need for an honorary citizenship in some foreign land that is true of patriotic people everywhere i do not take away in any respect from raoul wallenberg for the fine and courageous work be did in enabling many to escape from the death camps of adolph hitler his courage his heroic actions are beyond dispute his career and his qualifications are not the issue here the question is whether american citizenship should be granted in recognition so far as we know mr wallenberg has never been in the united states he has never done anything specifically for the united states he has never asked for american citizenship we do not know whether he would want this honor we do not even know if he is alive i cannot believe that we should convey the highest honor that america can convey upon a person under those circumstances finally i feel that there are some things in

and i intend to do so again this year one of my main concerns about a project of this magnitude has been with reference to equal opportunity last year when this issue came to the floor a rumor had circulated to the congressional black caucus that the naacp in that area was opposed to this project because of the lack of participation of minorities in this project as a result of this rumor i approached chairman tom bevill and confronted him with this rumor he was quite concerned about he rumor and assured me that it was untrue in giving me that assurance he invited me to visit the project to see for myself and to talk with any and every one involved with the project in orcler to ascertain the facts for myself as a result of his invitation i did accompany the chairman and several other members of congress to a site visit of the tenntom project not only did i see the project but i was given the opportunity to talk with many people regarding the project and minority participation in employment and contractual opportunities included in those talks were not only the corps of engineers but also people like wendell paris chairperson of minority peoples council on the tennesseetombigbee waterway their organization has over 4 000 people organized into 15 or more county chapters in the counties bordering the tennesseetombigbee these counties are in alabama mississippi and from mobile to the tennessee line the major goal of their organization is to insure that minorities and poor people receive a fair and proportionate share of all of the benefits of this 2 billion federal public works project in talking with this organization i learned that they have consistently supported full federal funding for construction of the waterway provided that minorities women and poor people are given an equitable share of the jobs training contracts and all other benef its of the project it is important to note that the tenntom project is located in one of the most rural and economically depressed regions of the nation forty percent of the population in the tenntom corridor is black in some counties the minority population exceeds 60 percent in about half the counties about half the population is low income in 1977 congress put a provision in the water resources act which required the secretary of the army acting through the chief of engineers to make a maximum effort to assure the full participation of minority gruops in employment and the utilization of minority firms under this section of the law the chief of engineers is directed to report to congress on july 1 of each year on their progress on implementation of the law as a result of this law and prodding by the minority peoples council i think a great deal of progress has been made in seeing that minorities receive their equitable share of participation in this project i do not say that all has been done to insure their full participation but great progress has been made notably the unitedstates army corps of engineers has become more concerned and sensitive to providing minorities women and local residents with a fair share of the project benefits during my visit to the site and here in washington since my visit i have had meetings with gen e 1 heiberg and brig gen james ellis regarding constructive steps to improve upon the progress now being made by them i think the corpi would be the first to admit that this project is not yet a panacea and that in spite of the progress which has been made they still have a lot to do in implementing their goals two of my distinguished colleagues parren mrrcinnll and harold ford have also worked with me in this matter to help insure minority participation in this project i want also to commend the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee mr bevill for his total commitment and insistence that the law be fully complied with and implemented to insure full minority participation i have also received full and completed cooperation from this very able staff hunter spillan and ed nolan have both been very helpful in conclusion i want to quote from a copy of a letter i received from an old friend dr aaron e henry president of the state conference of naacp in mississippi the letter was written to chairman bevill dr henry said we of the mississippi state conference of the naacp feel very strongly that the tennesseetombigbee project is a major employment project in mississippi it has a large number of blacks employed that would be without obtainable employment should the tennesseetombigbee project be curtailed or halted we urge this subcommittee to recommend that sufficient funds be appropriated so that the tennesseetombigee project can be completed i intend to vote against the amendment so that this project can continue in my opinion the completi n of the tennesseetombigbee will provide even greater economic opportunities for minorities economic growth generated by the waterway will provide much needed permanent jobs help increase personal income which is now the lowest in the nation and generate new business opportunities for minorities i hope the amendment is defeated"],

legally abolished the importation of new slaves into the country and in 1827 new york became the first state to abolish slavery the abolition movement was given impetus by william lloyd garrisons newspaper liberator established in 1831 and when dred scott took his case to the supreme court in 1857 the issue of slavery in americas new territories became the most divisive force in our nation americas black men and women would have to wait until the middle of the civil war to gain their freedom when in 1363 president lincoln signed the emanripation proclamation nearly a century later equal opportunity in america was advanced when the supreme court ruled in brown against board of education that separate but equal education was not good enough for americas black citizens the struggle did not end with that court decision the following year rosa parks went to jail for violating the jim crow laws in alabama the march on washington in 1963 and the hundreds of other demonstrations around the country served to educate our nation to the need for greater social justice congress responded by enacting landmark civil rights legislation which i was proud to help write the civil rights acts of 1957 1960 1964 and 1968and the voting rights of 1965brought about a social revolution in our country the names in this struggle are legion and the leaders were true pioneers who riskedand sometimes gave uptheir lives in their noble cause they sought to break down through eloquence and bravery the unjust barriers that confronted them for centuries it would be impossible to list all those

unique in its portrayal of the special role played by afroamericans in our countrys development many of the firsts for black americans happened in new jersey and in reflecting on our history i am reminded of dr kings letter from a birmingham jail in 1963 he said abused and scorned though we may be our destiny is tied up with americas destiny a look at the history of new jersey shows explicitly that the history of america is indeed tied up with the destiny of americas black citizens at the beginning of the 18th century blacks were brought to newark to work in the plantations and copper mines across the passaic river but by the early 1800s many of the slaves became free and started the first blackowned businesses in the nation the first black sunday school in the nation was established in newark in 1815 and 7 years later the first formal black church was founded in our city newark began a program of school integration early in the 20th century while most of the country continued strict segregationist education policies in 1917 essex county became one of the first local chapters of the national urban league and it has remained in the forefront of this movement ever since today the cities of newark and east orange in my district are led by black mayorskenneth gibson and thomas cooke both men are outstanding leaders who have earned national respect and admiration because of their

groups usually there is little action to benefit the nation or its economy but rather a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses

been used the language may not be model perfect but the fact is in essence we have not expanded it that indeed grants or projects for construction for solid waste disposal as an example are covered in the same manner the same is true of the synthetic fuel act the national endowment for the arts and so forth and so on the record is replete with consistency with regard to what we are doing i might just add that i think the unique posture of the national government in terms of seeking bids on projects puts us as a unique risk of liability with regard to various wage rates and undercutting the quality of service that we might achieve indeed in the private sector one can pick and choose the contractors that one chooses to work with but the public sector does not have that particular benefit as such i think there is a need for additional qualifications with respect to the contractors the quality of work that we might receive i think it is important to recognize and i think we all recognize it as a dilemma but we also of course fall down differently on basically how we should insure quality construction many of us believe that these labor standards prevalling wage rates are a significant factor in terms of achieving that quality one further fact i might add in passing this afternoon and that is the point the gentleman from illinois raised with respect to not receiving notification with regard to a point of order that was going to be raised against this amendment if it were offered to my perfecting amendment the gentleman knows full well he had the opportunity to offer his amendment at the conclusion of the perfection so i did not feel it was necessary in this instance to alert the gentleman since the basic thrust of what he is trying to do is reiresented on

there is no reference to black lung in the education and labor porton no reference whatsoever so the reimbursement of claims already paid the giveaway to the insurance companies and the coal mine

priced cars from abroad you cannot meet the requirement the honda accord at the beginning of its production will be about 50 percent american domestic content it hopes to go to 65 percent within the next few years but it took them almost 3 years to acquire the land and build the plant they are now in so the requirement for expansion to make other models here could not be met if the language of the present legislation is left as it is in essence this legislation has the same effect as import quotas because it raises prices of both domestic and imported cars in fact since the voluntary restrictions began the price of foreign cars has jumped 1 900 but this bill would have the added effect that it will put american autoworkers as i said out of their jobs and those who are working directly for supplying the companies that came here to produce in the united states what we call for in this bill is that the first model year 1984 the quota under the legislation would be 15 7 to 20 percent depending on the number of cars produced and my legislation would provide for the domestic content to be 5 2 percent to 6 7 percent based on the sale of 470 000 to 600 000 cars in the next model year of 1985 it would be 33 3 percent to 40 percent under the present legislation i lower it to 11 1 percent to 13 3 percent for honda on the basis of selling 500 000 to 600 000 in the third model year of 1986 it would be 50 to 60 percent under the ottinger amendment i call for 16 6 percent to 20 percent under a scenario of 500 000 to 600 000 sales in the final year model year 1987 it would be 50percent under the language of the bill we call for 33 percent under 500 000 cars sold by honda and in the final year we call for 50 percent as they do except that we allow the possibility that the secretary of transportation might set a quota somewhere between 33 and 50 percent i do not think that is unreasonable because what it does is focus honda on the responsibility to meet the requirements in 5 years i cannot tell you what the impact on domestic manufacturers can be in this legislation because they did not testify very vigorously on the legislation most of them seemed to think that it was a poor idea as you know some of their automobiles are manufactured in part abroad and brought back into this country for sale some of them are manufactured almost entirely abroad the people that will benefit under this legislation however are the small sales cars the subarus those that do not sell much in the united states and therefore would fall outside of the purview of this

the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts this is an important amendment it does not involve huge amounts of money but involves a lot of american jobs we talk about a world free market i say to those who oppose this particular amendment if we had no countries providing subsidies i would not be in front of you asking this let us take a look at the realities the united kingdom 35 percent of the exports are supported japan 35 percent of the exports are supported france 20 percent of the exports are supported germany 12 percent of the exports are supported the united states 6 percent of our exports are supported so what we spend let me tell you we get a least 50 times more bang for the buck out of this than 99 percent of the taxes that we scattered around this countryside a year ago just today someone handed me the bulletin of the machinery and allied products institute they have this sentence while the administration argues that its policies will eventually improve the competitive position of unitedstates industry the high cost of domestic funds and the shortfalls in the exportimport bank with lending support clearly are causing a substantial volume of orders to be lost currently in fiscal year 1981 we were at 5 5 billion this is not appropriations this is leading authority in fiscal year 1982 4 4 billion and i am asking that we go up to 4 7 billion i would point out there is no outlay increase for fiscal year 1983 each 1 billion in exports provides 30 000 jobs the 1980 expenditures are estimated to have brought into this country 570 090 jobs if the president is correct when he says that 1 percent unemployment costs us 25 billion and i think lie is correct then what we spend here not only costs us nothing it saves us money there is finally the need on the part of our country to negotiate when you limit the amount because we are in a competitive situation on negotiations you limit in the extreme the ability of this country to negotiate we just had an amendment before us on the nuclear freeze and i joined the huge majority of you who said let us not have a unilateral freeze and yet that is what we are doing in the economic world when we do not support the exportimport bank finally we are right now in negotiations with the oecd countries to have some kind of universal policy if we do not increase this amount we are tying our hands we are weakening this country in negotiations i do not think that makes sense at all i would finally add to you that last year 2 600 unitedstates firms benefited from this firms from every state in the
