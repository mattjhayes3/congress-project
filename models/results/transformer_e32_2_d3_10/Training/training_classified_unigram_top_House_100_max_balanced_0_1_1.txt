take this opportunity to say a few words about our beloved sala burton mr speaker and my colleagues and those who are watching this memorial sala burton served in this house for 3 years her husband served for close to two decades if you look at that statistic alone it does not really tell you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the working people and the ability of those people to organize collectively to fight for their rights they always saw the people who were struggling who were having a tough time as the ones who needed their help most they cared about protecting the environment and they cared very deeply about this nation of ours sala burton was a refugee from poland she and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes at the lovely memorial service in san franscisco was given by the speaker of the state assembly another person who has gone back even longer than almost any of us who are involved in public office in his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will insert that interview into the record i think it speaks a lot about sala in ways that many people did not know about her

legislation to postpone the date on which the second and third installments of contra aid will be made available in order to give the house and senate select committees time to complete their investigations of the iranian arms scandal this is not the first time i have stood on this floor to talk about legality and fiscal accountability in the contra aid program last march i stood here because we did not know where 27 million in contra aid had gone we were reading stories in the newspaper every day about money that may have been lost or diverted to honduras or used to buy weapons instead of food and medicine at that time i introduced a resolution of inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter as a result of my resolution and the investigations which followed we learned that onehalf of the 27 million appropriation is missing we may never know where that money went we may never know whether money the congress appropriated for humanitarian aid was used to buy weapons and ammunition lastfall i stood here again when we were debating whether we should give another 100 million to the contras but i did not think we should spend another dime for the contras until weknew where the previous appropiation had gone so i introduced an amendment to prohibit any aid for the contras until we knew where the 27 million had gone my amendment lost and the house sent the unfortunate message that legality and fiscal accountability did not matter in the contra aid program one month later we learned that the united states had secretly sold weapons to iran and then diverted the profits from those arms sales to the contras and we found out that these diversions were made at a time when congress had specifically prohibited aid to the contras i had written to attorney general meese just 1 day before these disclosures were made to request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the arms shipments to iran and united states involvement with the contras at that time my concerns were based on news reports linking the administration to the hasenfus affair and on continuing evidence that the united states had been providing aid to the contras the very next day we learned how deeply involved the united states may actually have been with the contras according to attorney general meese between 10 million and 30 million in profits from these sales had been diverted to bank accounts held by the contras these diver sions had been made at a time when the boland amendment specifically prohibited aid to the contras in any form so i am standing here again and the questions are the same how much money was given to the contras where did the money come from was it done in violation of the law what was the money used for these are important questions and they demand answers but before we even have a chance to learn the answers the house may again face the issue of providing aid to the contras under the provisions of the aid law congress passed last year the 100 million appropriation for the contras was split into three installments a first installment of 40 million a second installment of 20 million and a final 40 million installment the first in stallment was released immediately but the second and third were delayed under the aid law the second installment is now available anytime the president wants to make use of it the third installment which is subject to a congressional resolution of disapproval is available after february 15less than 1 month from now the administration has not announced its intention to make use of the second installment and the third is not available until the middle of next month that means that 60 million in contra aid is waiting to be spent next month if the president decides he wants to apply the last installment of contra aid congress may pass a resolution of disapproval and try to prevent him from applying the aid but i do not think that we will have any clearer picture of the diversion issue in 3 weeks than we have right now we need more time and the american people need more time to learn the facts for this reason i am introducing legislation to push back the date on which the third installment becomes available from february 15 to november 15 the house investigating committee is expected to issue its final report on october 30 which would give the house 2 weeks to consider the results of that investigation before considering the release of funds for the contras in addition my legislation would place the second installment in escrow until november 15 as well my legislation allows for the changeover in fiscal years so that the money would still be earmarked for aid to the contras but it would not become available until we know more about the diversion issue after november 15 the president could report to congress on his intention to apply the remaining 60 million in appropriated funds for aid to the contras congress could still as under the original aid law pass a resolution of disapproval but instead of voting to disapprove of the third installment only the congress could vote to disapprove of the second installment as well let me make clear that my legislation would not alter the purpose of the original aid law if after november 15 the president wanted to use the 60 million for the contras and if there were no evidence at that time that a diversion might have taken place then the aid could be applied just as under the original aid law congress would however reserve the right to disapprove of the release of funds the main goal of my legislation is to give us more time to make what will be a very important decision all my legislation does is give 2 the reference in that section to on the congress and the american people the and after february 15 1987 shall be time they need to know the facts before deemed to read after november 15 1987 facing this issue once again and 3 section 206 c of the act shall be i voted against the 100 mil deemed to read as follows lion aid appropriation but it was the will of c funds transferred under subsection the unitedstates congress that the aid be approved i a shall remain available until may 31 do not question that decision although i do 1988 not agree with it but when the congress sec 3 description of act referred to made that decision last year we did not know as used in this act the term the act all the facts we did not kow that the united means the act making appropriations for states may have been violating laws by pro military construction for the department of viding aid

charges hit top harian officer by e a wayne wasingtonm united states attorneys in miami are preparing to indict a senior haitian military figure on drug trafficking charges according to unitedstates and haitian exile sources col jeanclaude paul commander of the powerful dessaline battalion in haitis capital has been under suspicion of drug smuggling since 1986 sources say but only recently have investigators compiled enough evidence to proceed with grandjury activity and possible indictment ile would apparently be charged with aiding the flow of colombian cocaine to the unitedstates and of arms from the unitedstates to colombia sources say some sources say an indictment is imminent but given secrecy of the process others are unsure if colonel paul is indicted the case will severely challenge haitian president leslie manigat who has pledged a crackdown on drug smugglers though unitedstates officials were unwilling to discuss the judicial investigation they said an indictment could call into question the arrangements by which mr manigat came to power if he tries to fire paul unitedstates congressional sources say that will view this as a serious litmus test of civilian control in haiti and of how the unitedstates should deal with the new regime pauls unit is viewed as the most important in the country and his troops are fiercely loyal to him unitedstates officials say this makes it very difficult for haitis president or pauls nominal military superiors to move against him wellinformed haitians say paul has warned that he will not go down alone if others try to remove him paul allegedly played a major role in directing violence that upset the november elections in haiti because of close ties to the tonton macoutes the secret police created during the duvalier dictatorship the violence and killing paved the way for manigats election last month paul is seen as very close to the gen william regala who was no 2 man in haitis transitional junta and may be named defense minister he is the muscle and regala is the brain says a haitian opposition source but paul has an independent power base since becoming commander of the dessaline barracks in early 1986 he has assiduously wooed his troopsdining with them wearing fatigues like theirs supplementing their pay with bonuses allegedly funded from drug trafficking washington sources say they will kill at his command a haitian opposition source says paul has also reportedly incorporated several thousand tonton macoutes into his unit making it even more formidable us officials say hes got all the guns one us specialist says washington first raised reports of pauls activities in the transitional haitian government in 1986 but received no satisfactory reply officials say after the initial us complaints an internal haitian military investigation was launched haitian exile sources say the final report reportedly confirmed the charges and included aerial photos of pauls farm with a private landing strip but after the army chief of staff presented it to gen henri namphy the thenacting head of government the investigating officers were reportedly transferred and accused of plotting a coup the army chief of staff and the colonel in charge of the investigation were subsequently forced to retire us officials could not confirm the haltians charges while stressing their lack of knowledge of the us judicial investigation they say earlier us intelligence indicates paul is alleged to have taken over parts of the drugtrafficking ring once reportedly run by the fatherinlaw of mr duvalier pauls brother alexander former haitian consul in miami is reported to have been in that earlier operation and the current one they say colombian cocaine and marijuana were reportedly the staples of this trade informed haitians here say that paul is well tied into the tonton macoutes in part because his father was in the personal entourage of franqois duvalier who founded the group to keep the military and opponents in line pauls reported ill deeds go beyond drugs a reuter dispatch from haiti reports that he and his two brothers arranged to receive the 4 000 tons of waste from the city of philadelphia dumped on the haitian coast line near the port of gonaives in january haiti opposition sources have provided the monitcr with what appears to be an import authorization from haitis minister of commerce for the paul brothers to import 20 million kilograms of usorigin ash free of inspection unloading of the ash stopped after local residents vigorously complained news reports from haiti indicate the waste may contain high levels of dioxin press reports say the paul brothers reportedly received 200 a ton to accept the ash washington will be watching carefully how the haitian

men and women the trade deficit in this country has dramatically increased since the reagan administration took office rising from 40 billion in 1981 to over 170 billion in 1986 the administration has demonstrated that it is unable to respond satisfactorily to our evergrowing trade problem leaving congress no option but to step in with a legislative remedy h r 3 is such a remedy and is an appropriate and long overdue answer to our astounding trade deficit of special importance to my home state of west virginia are the provisions in the bill which deal with trade adjustment assistance worker benefits and other worker retraining and assistance programs the rate of unemployment in west virginia remains one of the highest in the nation and the state has the additional dubious distinction of having the highest rate of job loss due to plant closings in the country h r 3 modifies the trade adjustment assistance program in a manner which will be very beneficial to west virginia the bill specifies that all workers certified for assistance under taa would be entitled to up to 4 000 in training and remedial education benefits if the cost of the services provided is less than 4 000 the remainder could be used to pay relocation expenses presenilty workers receiving taa assisance apply for specific training and education programs and the amount of services provided to individual workers varies depending on the programs and their availability by creating an entitlement program the bill would ensure that all workers will receive an adequate level of service the bill creates a new option of supplemental wage payments under taa for workers who take a new job that pays less than their previous job specifically workers would be entitled to receive a supplemental wages 50 percent of their taa unemployment allowances subject to the limit that their new wages and supplement combined could not exceed 80 percent of their previous wage the typical supplement would be about 2 per hour and could continue for up to 1 year under the bill workers eligible for taa would be permitted to choose between undergoing retraining or taking a lesser paying job this option is especially important to older workers who may not wish to undergo retraining and begin a new career new badly needed funding sources for taa are established in h r 3 language in the bill specifies that any tariff revenues collected as a result of import relief or unfair trade actions are to be deposited in a special adjustment industry trust fund within the treasury to be used to help support taa or any other federal program that might be established for communities in which a substantial number of workers or firms are certified for ta expenditures from the trust fund would still be subject to annual appropriations title v of the bill establishes a new program of great importance to west virginia entitled worker readjustment which would provide comprehensive services to dislocated workers who have lost their jobs due to plant closings layoffs or other major disruptions this includes but is not limited to workers directly affected by increased imports h r 3 authorizes a total of 980 million for the new worker readjustment program for fiscal year 1988 the bill directs each state to establish a tripartite council to oversee the operation of the new program the councils would be composed of equal numbers of representatives from labor management and public and nonprofit organizations in addition the bill requires each state to designate a rapid response team or office within the state government which can respond immediately to major plant closings these teams would assist workers with reemployment employee buyouts enrollment in training progams and early retirement planning and would provide other social services under the bill 30 percent of the funds for the adjustment program would be allocated to basic readjustment servicesservices to meet the immediate needs of workers following a plant closing these services include job placement assistance counseling and job clerks up to 15 percent of funds for basic services could be used for supplemental income and supportive services for displaced workers no more than 15 percent of the funds could be used for administrative costs onehalf of the funds under the new adjustment program would be used for retraining and longterm adjustment assistance to displaced workers including classroom training literacy workshop onthejob training and remedial education the bill specifies that to the maximum extent possible workers should be given training certificates or vouchers so that they can select and arrange their own retraining up to 30 percent of this category of funds could be used for supplementary income and supportive services for displaced workers who otherwise could not afford to enter such retraining funds would be distributed among the states based on a weighted formula which takes into account each states unemployment rate its unemployment rate relative to other states and its longterm unemployment rate as a state with chronically high unemployment rates west virginia would receive a fair share of these funds finally the remaining 20 percent of the adjustment funds would be allocated at the discretion of the secretary of labor for special projects of national or regional concern these projects could include industrywide activities technical assistance responses to mass layoffs or demonstration projects to reiterate while h r 3 is a highly complex

and destroyed schools the administration calls for democracy in nicaraguabut trampled it at home with the irancontra affair so far has been legally spent 275 million on the contras what are the fruits of this policy a trail of senseless killing compare this legacy with the recent accomplishments of the guatemala accord the state of emergency in nicaragua has been lifted amnesty to some 3 000 political prisoners has been granted municipal and local elections are promised and special courts have been abolished the sandinistas have entered direct talks with the contras reopened la prensa reopened radio catolica and issued 13 licenses for new radio stations el salvador and guatemala have also taken important steps because of these tangible real actions and the future promise of the guatemala accord we have reached an impasse over aid to the contras the united states cannot talk peace and fund war we cannot support both the guatemala accord and the nicaraguan contras the proposal we are considering today is not a modest request to keep food in the mouths of contras it is a package to keep the contras waging war in the countryside if we are really on the side of peace in central america we must reject this request let me make three simple points about the presidents request first according to the administration 90 percent of this aid would be for nonlethal purposes but this nonlethal funding can be used for helicopters military training aircraft spare parts portable bridges and intelligence operations not one penny of this package would have to go for food medicine and clothing second this aid would represent not only a continuation but an escalation of the war in nicaragua this package is worth 300 000 a dayroughly three times the rate we recently passedunfortunatelyunder the continuing resolution this is not the time to escalate the war this is the time to end it third under the presidents proposal 3 6 million in lethal aid would be held in escrow and released on march 31 if no ceasefire is in place this would mean that if the contras could stall ceasefire talks until march 31 they would be awarded with 3 6 million in guns and ammunition what possible incentive would they have to negotiate for 6 years the american people and the congress were told that contra aid would bring the sandinistas to the bargaining table thanks to the courage of president arias and the other central american presidents nicaragua is at the bargaining tableand yet were here considering a new aid request from the president it is now clear what the presidents policy recently is his policy is to aid the contras because the sandinistas are communistsnothing more nothing less that is a bankrupt hollow and simplistic policy a policy driven by ideology rather than pragmatism led by former somocistas the contras have not and will not win the support of the nicaraguan people they cannot win a significant military victory they have been corrupt and guilty of numerous human rights abuses as yet they have no program for nicaragua and no future vision for nicaragua except to remove the sandinistas finally let me say that for 6 years the administration has been telling us that its contra policy will promote democracy and freedom in central america but after 6 years all we have to show for it are thousands of dead civilians a region torn apart by bloodshed and strife and a deepening distrust of americans in central america true to the meaning of the word contra the administrations policy is contra the rule of law at home and

the people that the president calls freedom fighters they are outnumbered with the military strength of the sandinistas but they are still fighting for freedom i wonder why we have become so sophisticated that we cannot recognize it that it was free dom fighters who made our own united states possible have we gone so far from our roots that we have forgotten the men and women who cre ated this great country of ours what about these americans who dumped tea into boston harbor in defiance of the british rulers what of those who fought and died at saratoga and at valley forge these were no fancy military experts but they knew if they could get their freedom they had to fight for it and that is what the contras are doing the individuals that we are proposing to cut off with this legislation what a travesty that so many members of this body should be opposing the men and women who seek freedom and who hate a cruel and ruthless dictatorship have we forgotten how our country was built the brave men and women who crossed the river delaware with general washington to put to rout the british enemy whom they had opposed they were also contras they were contra england how can we justify a vote in opposition to these nicaraguan freedom fighters how can we turn our backs to those who seek freedom who are even willing to give their lives in freedom let us remember that nicaragua is in desparate straits its inflation rate is at an astounding 13 000 percent and as the eloquent columnist of the washington post mr krauthammer said if the united states stops helping the contras she will have managed the most extraordinary self inflicted strategic surrender in memory our decline will be well earned certainly no redblooded american would want to be present at that consummation this afternoon we are debating the future of tile contras but the basic issue in this debate is what america itself is all about the opportunity of freedom over the years america has stood for freedom and thousands of people from other lands have come to america because they hated oppression one of the very first actions of the new united states of america was a proposal sponsored by our fourth president james lonroethe monroe doctrineand its impact was sweeping that we would tot permit any foreign government to eatablish itself in our hemisphere we wanted only governments that were free as we in america the issue before this free american congress today is freedom itself the nicaraguan government as everybody knows has violated that monroe doctrine a native leftwing groupthe sandinistasforcefully took over the somoza government but they only did so by promising the organization of american states that they would establish a free democratic government that would include other parties that free elections would be held and that would include persons representing all groups in the nation but those promises were quickly shoved aside and the government of the ortega boys promptly forgot their promises to the nicaraguan peopleabout freedom within a short time nicaragua has become a totalitarian communist regimea total violation of the monroe doctrine in a continent

their products will bear the extra cost of the uneconomical ocean freight that will be required but we should not stop with agriculture clearly if this amendment is bad for agriculture it is bad for

designed to shore up the farm credit systems finances and require debt restructuring by both the fcs and the farmers home administration this legislation will keep the system afloat and farmers in business this bailout is only a guaranteed loan to fcs that they will have to pay back over time i am particularly pleased with the package of borrower rights that i helped author which includes debt restructuring as well as specific criteria to deal with right of first refusal mediation right of review of a denial of restructuring and borrower access to loan documents debt restructuring will be an option for troubled borrowers if it is less than the cost of foreclosure this benefits not only the farmer in trouble but all borrowers in the system if fcs losses are lower they wont have to charge higher interest rates to cover higher losses in addition to protecting borrower stock and shoring up fcs finances the compromise package also reorganizes the system to cut down on overhead costs and make it more efficient we should be able to save about 130 million per year by requiring fcs district offices to merge the bill retains some stockholder control by allowing the members to vote for the merger of a district bank finally i feel that the secondary mortgage market provides another credit opportunity for farmers this concept has worked well in the housing industry it should make more cap ital available to farm borrowers at lower interest rates i believe that this conference report is a good compromise between the many concerns and wishes of the different groups that are

most important amendment that we are going to be debating during this consideration of the defense bill what we are talking about here is the socalled phase 1 system which is intended to create additional uncertainty for a soviet war planner in other words the objective of phase 1 is nothing more than to increase to some degree the survivability of key military targets thus it should be judged on the same basis as other steps to enhance deterrence through survivability target hardening and mobility what is the cost of phase 1 the cost is between 75 and 150 billion it is a very expensive option after having gone out and visited the contractors it is clear that phase 1 can be easily countered either by direct descent nuclear asats or by countermeasures therefore i have very major reservations about whether we should deploy it at all the office of technology assessment has recently completed a study that talks about the potential for a massive failure caused by software technology that would be used in this system and if it did fail massively i think it would certainly not confound any soviet targeters with that kind of a problem i would urge the committee to go ahead with the spratt amendment i think what we need to be focusing on is the longerterm technologies and in my judgment there is more promise there than in rushing ahead with phase 1 deployment i
