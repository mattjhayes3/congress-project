balance the republican budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the spratt alternative budget"], [0.0027161836624145508, 0.9972838163375854, 1, "thank you sir the bottom line is that we have a republican majority that rubber stamps everything that the administration hands to them they cant even put the paper on the desk fast enough before they rubber stamp it when you start talking about the fact that by the constitution we are supposed to carry out oversight that is not a value of the republican majority li 1915 oversight of what no see they are too busy taking care of the special interests you would think that some members were more concerned with trying to make sure that special interests got what they needed because we do not want to forget the k street project where you pay to play and you get access into this republican majority house so when you look at the rubberstamping of what has happened here i cannot help but have this stamp here because that is how we got here but what is very very unfortunate is the fact that we have ourselves in a situation in a fiscal situation that is going to take a generation almost to recover from we have ourselves in a situation in iraq we do not know how many years it may take for us to recover from that and i am using the presidents words now we have ourselves in a situation where the white house now wants to invite members over to have tea and cookies right now and trying to be niceynice to say we want to hear from you now but we have men and women caught in the crossfire and we have millions and billions of dollars that have been wasted and stolen in iraq i am going to say stolen because of the rubberstamp republican majority anything that the administration sends down how can we rubberstamp it matter of fact i think the republican majority walks around with a little mini rubber stamp in their pocket saying oversight this is the way you want it and how you want it the american people have to send a very strong message to this republican majority here in the congress that we have three branches of government for a reason not two branches of government that deals with legislation and policy but three branches we have the judicial branch that is separate and aside but when you look at the legislative branch we are supposed to carry out oversight only a couple of members of the republican majority actually gets that and tries to practice it but they are in a superminority and so the reason why we come to the floor is to shed light on the lack of oversight when it was a democratic house and a democratic white house there was oversight cajl bill clinton up and ask him i think we know that republican majority the reason why you are going to see people around here scratching and fighting and begging and trying to do anything and throwing out the sods and trying to get press releases out because the white house is very very concerned that they will no longer be able to send legislation to the unitedstates house of representatives and that it passes through committees that may have a half a meeting on it and come to the floor not allowing democrats to do anything to improve the legislation because they are too busy rubberstamping the process and it will disrupt that it is all about power and influence and i can tell you right now the republican majority has gone too far with this because that is the reason why we are in the situation we are in now and they are known they have to shake it and they know it and they deserve the rubber stamp because that is what they have been doing since the president has been in the white house i am coming to ms jacksonlee i just want to give you a perfect example of what happens in a rubberstamp congress exhibit a how can you borrow 1 05 trillion in 4 years i do not even know how that can be achieved in 4 years the republican majority has handed president bush he cannot do it on his own we have the republican congress right under him from 2001 to 2005 1 05 trillion now here is the other kicker that comes in and with interest fortytwo presidents 224 years 224 years 42 presidents were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion i rest my case on that i rest my case on the fact that the republican majority has given the bush white house everything they wanted on the backs of the american people the special interests got what they wanted the billionaires got what they wanted"], [0.0027621984481811523, 0.9972378015518188, 1, "a track record a pattern of those who have made youthful indiscretions in their lives need it be on credit need it be some sort of criminal activity you can no longer have access you used to have the capital if you do not have a good credit record am i right let me just tell you something right now as it relates to the united states i am looking at japan you can put japan in the state of florida and the state of florida will swallow geographically japan but better yet look what they are holding of the unitedstates apple pie the bottom line is this is about the incompetence cronyism and in some cases corruption of these individuals being able to get access into this institution and into the executive branch to be able to get what they want i want to drive the point on here i want to make sure this is crystal clear it has to be crystal the bottom line is the only way that we will be able to have a paradigm shift not only in thinking but in policy and action on behalf of the american people and unless the american people like you say the majority they do not have to be the majority the american people can make that change they can say that we are willing to allow the democrats to lead so that we can hopefully start taking care of some of these issues that we have to take care of here at home with our troops in iraq and afghanistan and throughout the world so that we can get the respect of not only the world but our country our own country veterans they signed up for all the right reasons allowing us to salute one flag as we see it now are being asked to do more financially meanwhile 1 5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy while we have individuals while we are having veterans affairs centers closing in rural america and in urban america they are closing some of them are only open on wednesday now but meanwhile we have individuals we have the president every time he gets a chance he is talking about let us make the tax cuts permanent for people who are not even asking for it so this is very simple this speech on what the majority republicans say well trust us we know what we are doing we showed the letter from secretary snow i think we already know this we did not write this letter the guy has said the fifth time the secretary is saying we will not be able to operate the government that is one letter here is the other one here fortytwo presidents this president and republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion but better yet saying let us make a bad idea permanent let us drive this number up let us put a two here instead of a one it does not make sense only the american people can stop this crowd

here it is almost too much to share we do not have enough time to share what the members and the american people clients reward keeping k street lobbyists thriving i never blame the special interests for what happens here but i am going to tell you right now they have a tax shelter right now where 100 billion in unitedstates taxpayer dollars are not going into the coffers because they have an offshore deal with this administration and with this majority meanwhile we are sitting around here trying to figure out how our veterans are going to get health care meanwhile we are trying to figure how small businesses will be able to afford health care for everyday americans to be able to buy into and meanwhile we have troops still without body armor and the things they need to be able to fight on behalf of this country so we ask everyday americans to go out there and suck it up meanwhile the majority the republican majority based on incompetence some may say corruption in some cases as it relates to the white house i mean every day i am sorry every day we turn on the television what is new what is going on at the white house what is being held back from the american people what is being held back from the congress who came to the hill today and conflicted a story that they told just months ago about the fiscal outlook on the country meanwhile you have members that come up to this well on the majority side and say we are doing fine i do not know what these democrats are talking about but it goes against logic we have letters from their very own administration that are saying we have got to raise the debt limit because of our irresponsible policies"], [0.0028225183486938477, 0.9971774816513062, 1, "we appreciate the opportunity once again to come to the floor of the house of representatives as the 30something working group myself along with kendrick meek mr meek from florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you very much fot joining us i know you were busy in a homeland security committee hearing and i

time in which in 2000 the american budget was running a surplus but in that time we have run deficits on average a little north of 400 billion and we have added 3 trillion to the nations debt how did we do it we have tried to fight two wars with four tax cuts and this congress has served as an atm to the special interests showering them with billions in tax breaks and handouts the prescription drug bill is a classic example where we are now adding close to what the american people were once told would be a 400 billion prescription drug bill is now worth 800 billion and 139 billion in extra

50 billion from our education and health care what are we doing in iraq at this time what are we doing in iraq we are actually renovating and building 110 primary health carb centers vaccinating 3 2 million iraqi children rehabilitating 2 700 schools training 36 000 secondary school teachers in iraq we fund 3 120 dommunity development projects in iraq and we have provided housing for tens of

want to make the 21st century the american century like the 20th century you have to invest in america what have you done you have turned the budget into a pretzel all to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest of americans theyare patriots too when it comes to americas future every american must have skin in the game when it comes to rebuilding the coast that is the families and the communities of new orleans mississippi and alabama the choice shouldnot be cutting pell grants and college loans cutting student nutrition programs cutting health care for our elderly and most vulnerable as a way to pay for that yet at the same time this congress has allocated 445 billion to iraq and it is going to go north to 600 billion unaccounted for unpaid for all debt the american taxpayer has to pay for

was 104 ad and the chinese first invented paper a billion seconds ago it was 1975 and the last american troops had just pulled out of vietnam all of those things a very long time ago a billion is a big big number clearly measured in terms of time but a billion dollars ago under this administration and this republican congressional leadership was only 3 hours and 32 minutes ago at therate that

individuals who are tuning in who would like to know just what are the blue dogs more than anything else we pride ourselves on being first and foremost good stewards of the taxpayers dollars we provide the sterling leadership in the democratic party for responsible fiscal responsibility for 5 years we in the blue dog coalition have been begging and pleading that this congress develop a plan

dollars worth of damage an entire city entire region almost totally destroyed over 250 000 american citizens without homes we all remember those pictures down in new orleans in the flood our hearts went out to those people well our hearts must continue to go out to those people and the reason it is the height of hypocrisy is here is the president of the united states and this republican controlled congress who says that they want to offset a 70 billion tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country on the backs of those poor victims of this hurricane on the front page of the washington post this morning the answer from fema is to throw 150 000 american citizens who have become homeless on the street the answer from the white house and the answer from this congress has been to cut the very programs that will help these victims the most the most effective programs that have helped them has been the food stamp program and under this budget this republican held congress and this president proposes to cut food stamps by 850 million not only at a time when we have people who are homeless without jobs without hope but according to the agriculture department just this year alone we have added 2 million more citizens to the hunger roles the republicans answer cut the very program that has been designed to help them by 850 billion medicaid under this budget planned by the republicans and president bush they want to cut medicaid by 12 billion when 45 million americans mostly senior elderly citizens are going without any kind of health insurance and our farmers cut them by 2 billion farmers who have been devastated by the flood who have been hurt by the flood now is not the time to cut the farmers and our veterans 3 billion lord knows we have not been doing right by our veterans we have cut them we have cut them we have cut them and the presidents answer is cut the veterans this republican congresss is to cut the veterans is that not a reason why they have had difficulty in getting the votes why they have had to pull the bill last week and the american people need to wake up and understand and put the calls in to your republican congressman to let them know that america does not want to cut the basic services for the needy while trying to add a 70 billion tax cut for the millionaires and the billionaires they do not need the money but the children do this budget will cut childrens nutrition by 2 billion and 5 billion in child support heating oil is cut at a time when the oil companies are getting record profits and their execputives are sitting fast student loans 14 billion at a time when going to college costs so much there will be tens of thousands of american children who will not go to college if this republican budget reconciliation bill passes that is why this is so important that is why it is important listen to me america and if you know other people tell them to tune in we are here to tell you the facts this blue dog coalition is one of the most influential groups on capitol hill and the reason why is because people trust us we have earned that we have earned that distinction folks like charlie stenholm john tanner they have pioneered and set the curve respect across party lines respect across this country the blue dog coalition we are speaking the truth tonight william shakespeare said it well when he wrote that great play julius caesar when he said et tu brutus yours is the meanest cut of all and that is what these republicans are doing in this bill it is mean it is cold and it is wrong and the american people deserve better and we are going to give them better so mr ross and my fellow blue dogs we are here tonight to speak the truth we are here tonight to let the american people know and we hope and we pray that we will be successful in stopping this budget reconciliation bill from being devastating to the american people"], [0.0030588507652282715, 0.9969411492347717, 1, "on behalf of the 37member strong fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition i rise this afternoon to discuss our nations debt as you can see here today the united states national debt is 8 413 298 480 959 and some change if you divide that enormous number by every man woman and child including those babies being born today every united states citizens share of the national debt comes to the tune of 28 120 in the blue dog coalition we have coined the phrase the debt tax not to be confused with the death tax or estate tax the debt tax debt is one tax that cannot go away until we get our nations fiscal house in order that is what the democratic fiscally conservative 37memberstrong blue dog coalition is all about trying to restore some commonsense and fiscal discipline to our nations government as you walk the halls of congress and as you walk the halls of the cannon and the longworth and the rayburn house office buildings you will come across these posters which signify that you have walked by the door of an office of one of our fellow blue dog members we are concerned about this because from 1998 through 2001 this nation had a balanced budget and yet under this administration and this republicanled congress we have seen record budget deficits the largest deficits ever ever in our nations history in 2004 the deficit was 412 billion in 2005 it was 318 billion in 2006 it was 372 billion and in fiscal year 2007 it is projected to be 350 billion one of the largest deficits ever in our nations history one of the first bills i filed as a member of congress when i got here back in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund the republican leadership in this congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because the real deficit projected for fiscal year 2007 is not 280 billion or 350 billion depending on whose numbers you want to believe it is really 545 billion so where does the difference come about it is because this republican congress and this administration is counting the social security trust fund and that is wrong when you and i go to the bank to get a loan our banker wants to know how we are going to pay it back when are we going to pay it back and yet this republican congress continues to give us the largest budget deficits ever in our nations history while borrowing money from the social security trust fund with no provision being made on how or when that money will be paid back where is it going come from they cannot tell us when is it going to be paid back they cannot tell us social security has kept over half the seniors in america out of poverty it is time for this republican congress to keep their hands off the social security trust fund now why is this debt so important total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was 5 67 trillion let me repeat that from 1789 until 2000 the total national debt was 5 67 trillion but by 2010 the total national debt will have increased to 10 88 trillion this is a doubling this is a doubling of the 211year debt in just 10 years another reason that deficits should matter is because interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the federal budget and the debt tax debt tax is one that cannot be repealed until we get back to the days of a balanced budget not only is our nation borrowing 1 billion a day this number is going up by about 1 billion a day our nation is borrowing 1 billion a day more important than that our nation is spending a half a billion dollars 500 million every single day simply paying interest on the national debt that we already got before it goes up another billion dollars a day i represent a very poor district in arkansas we have a lot of hope in creating economic opportunities by building new highways we need 1 6 billion to complete interstate 69 it sounds like a staggering number until you think about it if we did not have this debt we could build interstate 69 with 3 days interest on the national debt our government will spend more money in the next 4 days paying interest not principal just interest on the national debt than what it would cost to completely build interstate 69 through arkansas interstate 49 will also be critical to creating economic opportunities and jobs for my district we need 1 5 billion to finish it again a staggering number until you think about we are spending 500 million dvery 24 hours simply paying interest on the debt we already got before it goes up another billion dollars today we could complete interstate 49 with just 3 days interest on the national debt hot springs arkansas we need about 200 million to complete the expressway around hot springs 80 million to get it up the hill and up the mountain and another 100 to 200 million to get it back down and totally completed 80 million would be nice 200 million would be better we could complete the hot springs expressway with just a few hours interest on the national debt el dorado arkansas the largest town in my district not located on a fourlane highway desperately needs fourlane access we could fourlane unitedstates highway 167 for about 400 million put it another way we could fourlane unitedstates highway 167 from little rock to el dorado and connect on down to louisiana to 120 with less than 1 days interest on the national debt interstate 1530 200 million to complete that project that is also under construction a lot of money but just a few hours interest on the national debt in fact we could build 200 brandnew elementary schools every single day in america just with the interest we are spending on the national debt we cannot meet americas priorities as it relates to reducing our dependence on foreign oil in fact we will spend we will spend more money in iraq in the next 8 hours than we will spend on research and development of biorefineries in the next 365 days health care education making the kind of advancements to our nations infrastructure that we so desperately need the kind of investments that we saw under roosevelt with the wpa program to help get us out of the great depression or with eisenhower with the interstate program these kinds of priorities for america will continue to go unmet until we get our nations fiscal house in order that is why as a member of the blue dog cqalition i am here to talk about this debt and this deficit because america has many priorities many priorities that continue to go unmet as our nation continues to borrow 1 billion a day as our nation continues to spend half a billion a day 500 million a day simply paying interest on the national debt meanwhile americas priorities continue to go neglected now why should deficits matter other than all of these reasons i have already given you deficits reduce economic growth we all know that look how much better the economy was in the 1990s when ve had a balanced budget deficits burden our children and our grandchildren it is wrong for us to borrow money from other countries to give tax cuts to people here earning over 400 000 a year and leave our children to pay the bill how would you like to go to the bank and tell your banker you want to borrow money to build this new house but you are not going to pay for it you are just going to leave the bills for your children you know mr banker i have got two wonderful children i am going to make sure they get a wonderful education grow up get a good job they are going to pay for this house the banker would try to have you locked up as being mentally insane yet that is how we are running our country today in fact deficits do matter because they increase our reliance on foreign lenders foreign lenders who now own over 40 percent of our debt where is this money coming from that we are borrowing 40 percent as we know some of it is coming from the social security trust fund with no provision on how or when it is going to be paid back well where is the rest of this debt coming from we are borrowing 1 billion a day where is it coming from is it coming from your hometown bank i do not think so it is coming from foreign central banks and foreign investors in fact the united states of america is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders to fund our lifestyle which is give me tax cuts if i make over 400 000 a year borrow the money from china and let my kids worry about paying it back that is thd way this republican congress is running america foreign lenders foreign lenders currently hold a total of more than 2 trillion of our public debt compare this to only 23 billion in foreign holdings back in 1993 the top 10 list the top 10 current lenders america continues to pass tax cuts for folks earning over 400 000 a year with money that we are borrowing because we are borrowing 1 billion a day with money they are borrowing from whom here is the top 10 japan the united states of america owes japan 640 1 billion china 321 4 billion as my friend and a founder of the blue dogs mr tanner has so eloquently stated and pointed out before if china decides to invade taiwan the united states of america will have to go to china to borrow more money to defend taiwan the united kingdom 179 5 billion opec imagine that we wonder why gas is approaching 3 a gallon our nation has borrowed 98 billion from opec to fund tax cuts for folks in this country earning over 400 000 a year korea the united states of america has borrowed 72 4 billion from korea taiwan we have borrowed 68 9 billion the caribbean banking centers 61 7 billion hong kong 46 6 billion germany 46 5 billion and are you ready for this rounding out the top 10 countries that our nation borrows money from to fund our outofcontrol deficit spending to the tune of 1 billion a day we have now borrowed 40 1 billion from mexico now when an american family sits down around the dinner table to pay their bills and budget for their household they include all of their family obligations their mortgage their car payment their credit card bills their education expenses you name it those hardworking folks take into account the cost of a 4year education for their children not just for one year of it they take into account their car payment and how many years it is going to take to pay for that car not just to drive it for a year when they mortgage their homes they take into account how long and by what means they will be able to afford their housing not just live in it for a year and you know what they expect the same from their government and yet as we can see july 11 today los angeles times editorial entitled another mission accomplished i am not going to read all of the editorial but the first two paragraphs are worth reading the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldress presidential dogandpony show president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly disparaging fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 that is not much to crow about that is an editorial that appeared today in the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished it goes on but the point is that this administration is so desperate for some good news that they are having a celebration to celebrate that our nation is not going to borrow 318 billion as it did in 2005 it is only going to borrow between 280 and 300 billion in fiscal year 2006 i submit to you that our nation borrowing nearly 1 billion a day is nothing to celebrate now contrary to this administra special orders for the blue dog coalitions rhetoric in light of these new tion now for quite a while on a weekly numbers touted today we have yet to basis to try to deliver the message to get government spending under con the american people in an honest and trol instead of talking about 1 year straightforward way about the fiscal we should have a real plan to deal with situation of our nations government the realities of our longterm debt and i was glad to hear him deficit just like american families do talk a little bit about iraq iraq is a for their financial obligations situation that we are having a great a perfect example of this is how we debate in this country about and i are handling our obligation in iraq i think that he made the point that we believe we all support our troops i all very strongly support the men and hope we do i have got a brotherinlaw women once we established the miswho spent christmas refueling air sion and sent them over there to perforce planes over in afghanistan my form and carry out that mission it is first cousins wife gave birth to their clear that we support them it doesnt first child during his service in iraq mean that we cant have an honest and we honor all of those who have and open dialogue and debate about the who continue to serve our country in policy iraq afghanistan and elsewhere is appalling to me as a where i disagree with this president person who wore the uniform during is on the point of accountability this the vietnam era to see those members president this republican congress is of the house of representatives and sending 279 million of your tax money the unitedstates senate or anybody that might to iraq every day and yet if you ask oppose the policy that the united him to be accountable for it if you ask states government has to have them him for a plan on how that money is called unpatriotic so i appreciate the being spent and how it will win the gentleman from arkansas bringing up peace and ultimately bring our men that point and women in uniform home he will i also came here today tell you you are being unpatriotic to talk a little bit about fiscal responthat is where i disagree with this sibility and to assist my friend from president arkansas in talking about the national we just entered our fourth year in debt i find it appalling to this war and i believe if we are going hear the partisan political rhetoric to send 279 million of your tax money that goes on in these chambers rhetto iraq every day this administration oric which celebrates a federal budget and this republican congress should be annual deficit of 300 billion held accountable for how that money is now most of us that have run a busibeing spent ness know that at the but we are still finding it piecemeal end of the day your revenues have to we are still excluding the cost of the match your expenditures or else you war from our annual spending process either have to borrow money with a we are passing a number of supple longterm plan to pay it back or a mental appropriation bills to pay for it shortterm plan and show your banker that mask the wars true cost it is how you can pay it back that year time it is past time that this adminis this administration and tration be up front with the american this republicanled congress over the people and include these important last 5 years have run our government costs in their annual budget estimates into a situation where we have a struconly then only then tural deficit built in there is not an will we be able to celebrate a real de economist anywhere around that will cline in deficits again tell you under the current revenue taxthe unitedstates national debt as of today is ing system and the current spending 8 413 298 480 959 and some change habits of this congress and this adminfor every man

republican leadership has pursued for the last 5 years it is time for a little honesty about where these policies are taking this country since 2001 the federal government has posted record budget deficits year after year during the 1990s democrats and republicans worked together with the clinton administration to cut the red ink and balance the budget for the first time in many years we balanced the budget in 1998 wekept it balanced in 1999 2000 and 2001 indeed we ran budget surpluses during those years and for the first time in a generation actually began to pay down the national debt since the bush administration took office in 2001 weve swung from balanced budgets to massive annual budget deficits in 2002the year after the congress adopted the administrations tax policiesthe federal government posted a 128 billion deficit in 2003 the deficit rose to 378 billion in 2004 the deficit soared to an alltime high of 412 billion in 2005 the deficit was 318 billion as bad as these deficits are they do not tell the whole story since these figures do not include the money the federal government borrows from social security and medicare trust funds each year in 2005 alone the federal government borrowed nearly 175 billion from the trust funds and were on course to borrow even more this year we cannot continue on the course were on it is wrong for this congress and this president tokeep borrowing half a trillion dollars each and every year and then pass this debt along to our children it is wrong for congress and the president to keep borrowing more and more from foreigners to fund tax cuts for the very wealthy china alone owns more than 818 billion of our debt the majoritys budget simply digs the deficit hole deeper the republican budget proposes a 348 billion deficit for 2007 if you add in the borrowing from social security and medicaremoney that by law must be repaidthe total deficit for 2007 soars to 543 billion the hard truth is that under the majoritys budget the federal budget never comes into balance the tide of red ink rises forever this policy is unsustainable and morally indefensible tucked away in this budget is a provision to raise the governments borrowing limit another 653 billion this would be on top of the 3 trillion in debt limit increases already approved since president bush took office at the very least there should be a straight upordown vote on a debt limit of this magnitude but evidently the plan is to try to sneak this through the majoritys budget also contains irresponsible cuts in critical domestic programs in this regard the majority has mirrored the bush administrations budget which included deep cuts in education critical medical research environmental protection veterans health care to name only a few areas there has been an attempt tonight to place a fig leaf over some of these cuts with a vague half promise of perhaps adding an additional 7 1 billion for domestic programs later all this fig leaf does is acknowledge that the funding shortfall exists in the republican budget without taking any action to actually address it i will vote for the democratic budget substitute offered by representative spratr the spratt budget pays down the deficits over the next 5 years and achieves balance in 2012 we restore fiscal discipline by bringing back the payasyougo budgeting rules and we force a degree of accountability by requiring the house to take a separate upordown vote on measures to increase the national debt limit in addition the democratic budget alternative provides 150 billion for future tax cuts and requires that any further tax cuts meet the payasyougo rules lastly our budget alternative rejects yet another round of spending cuts to key domestic programs that have been cut repeatedly in recent years the choice before the house could not be more clear we can vote to continue the failed economic policies of the last 5 yearspolicies that have resulted in massive annual deficits or we can say 3 trillion of debt and borrowing over 5 years is enough and vote for the spratt budget alternative that pays down these deficits and balances the budget i urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for representative spratts budget"], [0.0031476616859436035, 0.9968523383140564, 1, "i thank the distinguished gentleman from new york our ranking member on the ways and means committee for yielding me the time i thank you and our colleagues on the committee on the democratic side for the excellent work you did in putting forth the democratic alternative today you have made an excellent case for your substitute and indictment against what the republicans are doing let us talk about what is happening here today a few weeks ago right before thanksgiving there was a bill on the floor which was the republican budget bill so bad was this bill in terms of it not representing the values of our country that the religious community gathered in the rotunda of the capitol of the united states and they prayed that this congress would make the right decisions and reject the republican budget proposal they asked some questions about why we would be giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country while taking food out of the mouths of americas children they said they were going to draw a moral line ii the sand because a budget should be a statement of our national values and what we care about in our country should be reflected in that budget today we are talking about a tax bill which is handinglove part of the reconciliation that the republicans are putting forth so embarrassed were they by their own budget and so embarrassed were they by this tax bill that they had to have 3 weeks come between the two of them so that the american people would separate the cause and effect of what they were doing with their budget bill that was poor in its values poor in its priorities and increasing our deficit because of this tax bill today yesterday they engaged in another sham which was to pretend that they were giving alternative minimum tax relief for middleclass families in america if they cared about middleclass families in america they would have put that in this bill today which has the full protection as it goes over to the senate they know that that bill they passed yesterday has no weight in the senate it does not have the protection of the parliamentary process on the senate side and the same applies to what they did to try to give the illusion that they were helping our men and women in combat so that they would qualify for the lowincome tax credit if they cared about them they would have them in the bill today this budget as i said should be a statement of our national values and while we talk about that let us talk about what those values are america has always cherished the value of opportunity and one place where that is possible for more americans is in the issue of education taking these two bills together we are giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america while we are putting a burden on our young people by saying that they will pay 5 800 more in their student loans so that we can give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year that is not a statement of our national values that takes from our children their opportunity when we should be expanding it fairness fairness has always been a cherished american value fairness we see that during the last 5 years these 5 years of the bush administration 7 million more people in our country go to sleep hungry without adequate food because they cannot afford to buy food seven million more people an increase of 12 percent and what does this combination of reconciliation in order to give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year that cuts food stamps and takes many tens of thousand of children off the school lunch program do as the religious community said how can we as a country give tax cuts to the wealthiest and take food out of the mouths of our children that is not about fairness fairness is an american value community america has always been about community alexis de tocqueville said it about the origins of our country and community means safe neighborhoods the safety of our people homeland security and the rest we are not putting adequate resources to cops on the beat or anything else in order for us to give these tax cuts at the high end that is not about community that is totally unfair and it is diminishing opportunity let us take the value of responsibility personal responsibility fiscal responsibility which should be the order of the day in this conversation here the combination of their tax bill and their budget bill in reconciliation which i do not blame them for separating by 3 weeks because it is a total embarrassment with that they are increasing the deficit they are increasing the deficit by 20 billion in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest americans they are putting the burden of debt on americas children individual debt with their student loans and fiscal debt in terms of our national debt and what our kids will be burdened with it is just totally irresponsible and at the same time increases the deficit democrats support payasyougo no deficit spending if something is important to you figure out how to pay for it but do not make my children and grandchildren have to pay for it or anybodys children and grandchildren have to pay for it every opportunity i get i want to sing the praises of the clinton administration coming out of that administration we were on a trajectory of 5 6 trillion with a tr dollars in surplus in the years of the bush administration that has been almost fully reversed over 4 trillion in deficit a swing of around 10 trillion an incredible burden on the future a tax on our childrens future and this is the party of fiscal responsibility republicans have completely abdicated that the democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility we showed we can do it then we can do it again we should not today be catering to this appetite for deficits that the republicans cannot seem to get over it is just absolutely immoral immoral for us to heap those deficits on our children i want to commend my colleagues on the democratic side for what they have done and put into their proposal the house democrats are committed to an america that works for everyone not just the privileged few our democratic substitute reflects the values of community by shielding the middleclass americans from the alternative minimum tax in a bill that really counts not in some suspension of yesterday that has no weight in the conference with the senate and it provides tax relief the democratic alternative does for our soldiers in combat in the bill that really matters as well the democratic substitute demonstrates fairness by not adding to the deficit and it creates opportunities spurring economic growth generating jobs and supporting our small businesses our democratic members on the committee have eloquently made an indictment against this budget which is immoral because of the 70 billion in tax cuts mostly for americas wealthiest the republican budget decimates the very initiatives that middleclass americans rely upon to get ahead the poor suffer the rich benefit the middle class is paying the bill the number of people without health insurance has increased 4 years in a row people are hungry a 12 percent increase the number of people who do not have health insurance has grown they are cutting 45 billion in medicaid a health insurance program that is mostly for americas poor children many of them katrina survivors alexis de tocqueville talked about community in america he wrote back to the french america is great because america is good if america ever ceases to be good he concluded america will cease to be great this is a moment that no one in this body wants to hasten we all want america to be great and america to be good together we can do better by returning to our fundamental values to maintain americas goodness by rejecting this immoral tax bill"]], "top_incorrect":

called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund

wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch

the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat americas working families with the respect and dignity they have earned the choice to provide hundreds of billions more in tax breaks for the ultrawealthy is shameful its even more shameful to do it while steadfastly refusing to raise the minimum wage"], [0.9878465533256531, 0.9878465533256531, 0, "i

texas veterans who are buried there texas cities and towns across the state are holding many important memorial events in honor of the fact that 169 years ago today the texas declaration of independence was ratified by the constitutional convention of 1836 at washingtononthebrazos less than 100 years after american patriots declared independence from the tyrannical british empires military domination texas declared its independence from mexico after july 4 1776 democratic government became a birthright for the people of the new world but one that we would have to fight for like the american patriots driven to revolution by heavyhanded british intervention texas declared its independence after many years of living peacefully as part of the mexican federal republic because mexico became dominated by military dictatorships the seeds of texas independence were sown in 1824 when a military dictatorship abolished the mexican constitution in the words of the texas declaration of independence the texas peoples government have been forcibly changed without their consent from a restricted federative republic composed of sovereign states to a consolidated central military despotism the texas declaration of independence also based the justification for revolution on the grounds that the government of mexico had ceased to protect the lives and liberty and property of the people the military dictatorships that had unfortunately captured the mexican government also did not provide for trial by jury freedom of religion or public education failure to provide these essential services violates the sacred contract between government and the people it is important to remember that the struggle for texas independence was a political struggle not an ethnic conflict in fact many texas hispanics consider themselves tejanos and not mexicanos tejanos lived in texas long before mexico existed and they moved there for the same reasons anglos later moved there freedom to run their own affairs anda wild but productive landscape so we are inspired by so fiany tejanos that joined the fight for independence when the mexican government became an exploitive military regime including captain juan sequin lorenzo de zavala a future republic of texas vice president when texans and tejanos protested the undemocratic changes to mexicos government they were thrown in jail and the mexican army marched to war on texas to enforce the decrees of the military dictatorship at the point of a bayonet while future president sam houston and other delegates signed the texas declaration of independence santa annas army was besieging the texans and tejanos at the alamo in san antonio the alamo fell on the morning of march 6 1836 when lt colonel william barrett travis tennesseean congressman david crockett and approximately 200 other texan and tejano defenders were killed in action a heroic sacrifice for texan freedom on march 27 this same army massacred over 300 unarmed texans at goliad fortunately texans and tejanos achieved their independence several weeks later on april 21 1836 when approximately 900 texans and tejanos of the texas army overpowered a much larger mexican army in the surprise attack at the battle of san jacinto texas independence day is important to all americans because it is the event that show the brotherhood of freedom can be stronger than the brotherhood of ethnicity or nationality as tejanos proved at gonzalez bexar goliad and the alamo and along the banks of the san jacinto river and the government of the republic of texas people sometimes wonder what makes texas and texans so different and i believe part of that answer is the passion for freedom that gave us the first texas independence day is still alive today something about being raised in texas or even living there for an extended period of time makes texans less willing to put up with the infringement on our rights more willing to fight for them i believe part of that passion comes from knowing texas history today we give thanks to the many texans of all backgrounds that sacrificed for the texas freedom we enjoy god bless texas

is a controlled giowth it is a growth that hag not gotten out of hanhd mr speaker it is a growth that grows frbm 3 to 4 7 percent quarter afi 6ei quarter with an inflation rate that is 2 percent or less and unemployment rates that are in the 5 percent and less range that is where we want not too hot and not too cold a nice steady accountable growth and i would point out this that growth that we have in our economy is growing in spite of the fact that 3 5 percent perhaps of our gdp is going off the top to the litigation that goes on in this country we have to overcome that and still grow at a rate of about 3 to 3 5 percent to match a targeted growth rate that will deal with population growth and to deal with inflation and help us develop our infrastructure in this country to accommodate the future as our infrastructure depreciates that is what it is going to take to grow and what it is going to take to balance the budget should we have the will to do that would be to go into the nondefense discretionary spending recognizing that we have three large entitlements in our budget and those are the spending that just goes on year after year that is growing at a rate of about 6 2 percent a year and that is aggregate and that is social security medicare and medicaid those three entitlements are essentially unless we change some of the larameters are the right now the un touchable budget items and eventually this congress will have to look at them but those three entitlements will grow at about 6 2 percent of their aggregate the interest rate will grow perhaps even faster than that in the outyears you add all those things up and if you recognize that to make changes in that for this year is very difficult to do and also recognizing that we have defense spending that is critical to our national security and we need to take that off the table from a cut perspective and what is left is the nondefense discretionary spending that is the items of all everything else that we spend that i have not identified as being an entitlement of social security medicare medicaid defense spending that nondefense discretionary spending we will call that other to balance the budget we would need to simply cut the nondefense discretionary spending by 5 percent areal 5 percent cut and that would be 0 95 on the dollar that would be asking americans to get along with 0 95 out of every dollar that they have right now today not grow in relation to inflation and not grow with any kind of a cola now if i were looking at this from a business perspective i would advocate that we just simply balance our budget in that fashion but i am also aware that the votes on the floor of this congress will rot accommodate for that so i will be seeking to put together a budget that looks at some of the other components and gets us to the point where we can reasonably practically and in fact part of the equation here is politically balance this budget it cannot and should not be done by simply raising taxes by doing so it would stifle growth and it would get a reverse effect beyond in the opposite direction that my colleagues who just got finished speaking would say i am just going to go backwards through some of the remarks that i heard made over this past hour and address some of them i certainly cannot address them all but the argument that all of the money that was spent all this is a quote all that money is wasted meaning the money that was spent for reconstruction in iraq all wasted with no oversight no oversight mr speaker i take exception to a statement such as that i went over to iraq with three of my colleagues last august and returned here about august 20 with the very mission in mind to take a look at where the 18 5 billion that we allocated out of this congress had been spent where the practices were where the projects were how the money was being spent and what was the return on that investment and i brought a chart along with me coincidentally not knowing that would be the subject matter that was brought up here on the other side of the aisle this evening a chart that illustrates where these project dollars have gone i would point out that these red dots on this map of iraq represent 2 200 more than 2 200 completed projects in iraq and these projects will be road projects they will be sewer projects water drinking water potable water projects they will also be some bridge projects and some pipeline work for the oil pipe lines that are there you will see along on this border with iran the red dots along there many of those are border defense stations and what you will not see are the 250 planned border defense stations that are under construction or in planning around these othei borders that we have there is another 1 100 projects that are either in planning or under construction that do not show up yet on this chart i will have a chart that reflects the projects that are planned the projects that are started then this one reflects just the projects that are completed over 2 200 and i visited a number of these of course it would not be possible to visit them in their entirety but i stopped up here in this region around kirkuk and there went to the mother of all generators i forget just how many kilowatts that generator does put out but i remember what it weighed 750 000 pounds brought in on two large loads and then the other loads would be the rest of the generating plant across about 10 7 kilometers excuse me it was more than that it was a long stretch at least across the northern part of iraq with that kind of a long trail ofa convoy to deliver the generator and the turbine that drives that generator down to this location just south of kirkuk and that being one of two huge generation plants that are now in a position where they are up and running in iraq this one is fed by a natural gas pipeline some of them are using different types of fuel but up in this area around kirkuk there is so much oil that it actually seeps to the top of the ground in some places where i come from the area we call it the prairie pothole region where we have these potholes of water that are collected because of the dips that are cut out in the prairie from the last glacier well the water that collects there reminds me of the oil and certainly the oil is in smaller quantities that collects in the depressiois within the desert up there around kirkuk i and that is not the largest oil location up around kirkuk but down here in the southern part in the basra region there is far more oil and i look at the system of collection the well system the collection system the refinery system distribution system all of it is old tired dilapidated has not been reconstructed or modernized in at least 35 years and yet the oil production out of iraq is greater than it was we keep hearing no they are not producing as much oil now as they were then not true the royalties that iraq was receiving prior to the war were 5 billion a year the royaltiesthat are coming from the oil that is pumping today are 26 billion a year that does not necessarily reflect that they are pumping five times as much oil but it reflects that they are selling perhaps more oil than they did then and pumping more oil than they did the electricity that is being generated in iraq is anumber that is close to twice as much electricity at their peak days as it was on a standard day in iraq at the beginning of the liberation back in march of 2003 and as i measure project after project benefit after benefit it cannot be said that and i will quote again all that money is wasted how could all that money be wasted when we have 2 200 completed projects 3 300 projects altogether people that have potable water that never had it before people that have flush toilets that did not flush before they did not have water to flush in them looking at the infrastructure that is there in places in baghdad where they had the sanitary sewer and i would point out for the lay person listening that a sanitary sewer is not really all that sanitary that is what you run your sewage through and yet that sewer was an easy place for some people to pull a waterline through in those days before the ltberation of baghdad so their drinking water in many areas was delivered through a black piece of plastic pipe that was pulled through the sewer itself and they would pull it through and then the distribution runs out to the locations where it was being used and that is all fine as long as you keep your waterline in condition and it does not ever get a leak in it and you do not ever let the pressure go down but both of those things invariably happen and when that happens the pressure goes down in your drinking waterline and the sewage then is drawn into that drinking waterline and it then pollutes the drinking water that has happened in a number of areas in baghdad we are reconstructing that we are providing them with clean new sanitary sewer systems and sewer plants to be able to handle their systems in a modern fashion and an environmentally friendly fashion so the iraqi people that were living without services now have services i will say that the electrical service that was up to 10 11 perhaps even 12 hours a day in baghdad at the beginning of the liberation is down to less than that now perhaps even as low as 4 to 6 hours a day but the rest of iraq was getting 2 to 4 hours a day and now they are up to 10 11 12 hours of electricity a day the next wave is to increase the generation capacity and the distribution so that baghdad can get back up again to a level that they were before but overall there is more electricity being provided into iraq today than there ever was the demand is perhaps twice as great as it was because you know what happens when people get electricity they figure out a way that they can put another appliance to work and plug it into a wall and use it like air conditioners that did not exist in any significant numbers now they are there in significant numbers tapped into that electricity we also know that satellite televisions were against the law in march of 2003 and today iraq is replete with satellite dishes onrooftop after rooftop in fact i did a survey from the air by helicopter over the top of a region up in kirkuk where many homes were built in about the same style and i had done so over the rooftops of mosul in the fall of 2003 and there my survey showed that about twothirds of the homes then already had satellite tvs and now iam seeing that in some of the neighborhoods in kirkuk there actually are more satellite dishes than there are roofs so you will see sometimes two or even three satellite dishes on a single roof that look like they are singlefamily dwellings from the air everyone in iraq has access to satellite tv which means access to the outside world there is access to internet cell phones those things have grown dramatically landline telephones have grown dramatically the number of newspapers are up to over 175 newspapers in iraq television stations up and running communication is flowing free enterprise is robust in the streets of baghdad people that are running shops out there making furniture out alongside the streets set it out on the side of the street and sell it and yes a bomb goes off once in a while and it is sad and it is tragic but the people of iraq clean things up and they grieve and they go back to work because they are optimistic about the future of iraq they are more optimistic about the future of iraq than the surveys show people are in the united states of america what went wrong her6 where people that we say do not have hope have more hope than those of us folks that have the great blessing of living in the united states of america with all of this hope that we take for granted and cannot apparently appreciate so the effort that has been put forth there it is not all that money that is being wasted not by a long shot mr speaker 3 300 projects all of them worthy and worthwhile and no they were not all cheap there was money that was spent for security and there were some projects that were sabotaged that had to be reconstructed again there is a project over here on the tigris river south of kirkuk where there were nine pipelines that went across the tigris river and those pipelines were cut in the liberation operations with the unitedstates air force and we went back to patch those pipelines together did so they were sabotaged again they were put across the river on a bridge and so we undertook the effort to put them all underneath the bottom of the tigris river they are backfilling that now and it is nearly completed and those lines will be opened up and running by i believe the target date is february 28 so another big day to turn those valves on and get that oil flowing south into parts where it can be converted back to cash and be able to help the funding in the great country of iraq this emerging free arab country that has now at least brought forth the name of a prime minister and i do not think formally has elected him yet but on that day that that happens and they seek this duly elected parliament iraq becomes the most representative arab nation in the world when they sit down at the united nations and their representative speaks on behalf of the iraqi people it will truly be a voice of the iraqi people quite unlike the voice of much of the rest of the arab world where the voicethat speaks for the countries that represent those parts of the arab world in the united nations often is the voice of a tyrant that would cut the tongues out of its oin citizens if they spoke up in criticism of the regime that is there in many of those countries but this country can become the lodestar of a free arab people an inspiration to the rest of the arab world an that is a chilling concept but it also inspiration that can cause the rest of should tell us that there is no negothem to see what iraq is stepping into tiated settlement we must defend ourwhat they are earning along with the selves the israelis have had to guard coalition forces efforts and sacrifice to every theater every bus stop every be able to be that inspiration for the hospital every school every synarest of the arab world and if that day gogue and still the infiltrators come in comes and i pray it comes mr speak and detonate their bombs and blow er we may well see freedom echo their women and children to pieces across the arab world in the same fash that happens out of a deep hatred ion that it echoed across eastern eu that we dont understand in this counrope when the wall went down in ber try and i dont claim to understand it lin november 9 1989 on that glorious but i know that hatred is directed at day that symbolized the end of the us we saw it september 11 we saw it cold war a victory for the united on 18 to 20 other attacks including the states and the forces of freedom uss cole we saw it in the unitedstates emand the forces of freedom could not bassy bombings in africa we have seen be stopped almost the first attack also on the twin towbloodlessly they echoed across eastern ers in other efforts shut off by good ineurope and we saw country after coun telligence work in this country try be liberated we cannot rest our choices though are guard every theater every bus 0 2320 stop every school every hospital since that time we have noticed every church every synagogue and pull that those who knew freeddm the least back into the shores of the united hungered for it the most the people on states and somehow think that we can the east side of the wall stepped up to protect every center in this country help all of our efforts our coalition and we wont be able to and we will see forces in iraq in greater numbers than the attacks come and we will see our the people on the west side of the wall women and children and our men blown the people on the west side of the into pieces wall had the privilege of living with or we can take this battle to them freedom since the end of world war 11 we can fight this war where they are the people on the east side of the wall but going out just to kill the enemy remember the days they werent free mr speaker isnt enough it is not a they remember the day of november 9 solution it is something that has to be 1989 when they had that opportunity done in certain areas of the world and to grasp their own freedom and within under those circumstances where there a couple of years that freedom did echo are training camps and active leaders across eastern europe and it needs to that are plotting and planning to atecho across the arab world tack and kill americans that must be so i submit that there done is a vision and mission in this overall but to go out and think that we war on terror and we need to do a far could kill all of our enemies is the better job of articulating why we are in equivalent of realizing that we had a this war i would point out that the lot of flies on our porch and in our loss of americans on september 11 was kitchen and then go out to the barn right at 3 000 americans that is more with the fly swatter and think we are americans lost there than was lost de going to take care of all those flies in cember 7 1941 in that day that would the barn with the fly swatter no you live in infamy can swat flies in the barn all day every we cannot forget september 11 we day and you will never accomplish the cannot forget that we were attacked task you have got to change the habiwithout cause we didnt provoke any tat that breeds that many flies you one who attacked us they attacked us have to clean the barn because they hate our way of life they and you need to leave an environment attacked the very center of western in there that doesnt breed those flies civilization and then they will leave you alone on and no amount of negotiation un the porch and in your kitchen as well derstanding no amount of sitting so i submit that the plan of the around and talking is ever going to re united states and the mission that has solve this disagreement these people been laid out by our commanderinwant us dead they have demonstrated chief president bush is to create a new that and we saw the celebrations in habitat to promote a new habitat in the streets in other parts of the world the region this is a habitat called as the twin towers fell that should freedom we happen to know that tell us that they will give us no quar where there is freedom there isnt a ter habitat that breeds terrorists we have if anyone doubts that take a look at never gone to war against another free israel take a look and see the cir people it has never happened in the cumstanoes there when the israelis history of this country and i dont thought they could trade land for think it has actually happened in the peace and yet they are still attacked history of the world hamas won the election there that so to the extent that freedom can be means the terrorists the people who promoted and we give people that opare sworn to annihilate the land of portunity to reach out and grasp and israel are running the government of earn their own freedom is also the exthe region that may or may not be a tent to which we can be safer as a peonation called palestine ple western civilization can be safer and the people in that part of the world can learn some tolerance for christianity for judaism for capitalism for free enterprise for this whole idea of western civilization that they seem to take such exception to there are good people in that part of the world and those good people need to be empowered and we need to be supportive bf them the allegations that were made here on the other side of the aisle about corruption in iraq with millions of unitedstates dollars we dont know that and i wont tell you that you can go into an environment with a 18 5 billion mission and spend every dollar that would be competitive with a project in the united states because i know that some of that money had to go for security and some of that money had to go for a high price to get the work done because who would go into that environment and do that work but that work was necessary and to the extent that anyone hag defrauded this government yes we need to search that out we need to have oversight but democrats in this congress are not absolved from that responsibility i did not hear a single solution come out here on the other side of the aisle not one all i saw was complaints lamentations objections because all things that go wrong are all republican responsibility according to the other side of the aisle and of course if they were just in power then everything would be all fine but we dont know what they would do because they havent proposed a solution not a single specific solution they are absolutely without an agenda but they have enough energy they have enough air velocity in their lungs to every night come down here and beat up on the people that are out here trying to move america ahead one statement was said that i will agree with made by the gentleman from florida he said i am so glad that i am not a member of the majority well to the gentleman from florida i want to say i am so glad you are not a member of the majority as well and so are the majority of the american people who have seen to it that there is majority in charge in this congress we do have our work to do i wont shirk that responsibility i step up to it gladly but we need to have our eyes wide open we need to promote a responsible budget and i will be promoting a balanced budget and a path we can get to a balanced budget in a way that we can get the votes in this congress to get it done if we do that we can ensure financial security for our children and our grandchildren but that financial security that can come with fiscal responsibility here in

now on this resolution i want to express grave disappointment with the bush administration i wrote every member of the bush administration after meeting with dissidents in china and over here who said please have the bush administration come to our church services the way that they did in the reagan administration with regard to the soviet union they said please we will stand with them we want someone someone from the bush administration to come into a house church we are tired of seeing the bush administration going into the churches that are recognized by the chinese government so i wrote every high appointee in the bush administration and i asked them would they call the individuals and stand with them go to their apartments as we used to do in the 1980s in moscow with the sakharovs and the scharanksys and in 3 months not one bush administration person has taken the time to pick up the telephone and to call the name and the telephone numbers of the individuals what do you get out of the bush administration silence silence we should remember the words of dr martin luther king who said and i quote in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends and dr kings statement is so poignant in times of trouble the silence of an enemy is expected but the silence of a friend is devastating i ask the bush administration to break the silence speak out for riba qadiri speak out for the catholic church speak out for the evangelical church speak out for those in tibet who are being persecuted the young buddhist nun who came to my office 2 weeks ago had been in the drapchi prison for 15 years for doing nothing this is a test i am writing the bush administration officials again and i am giving the telephone number to call i say now with this opportunity and i am going to give them the words of dr martin luther king silence should be over it is now time for the bush administration to adopt the policies of the reagan administration of ronald reagan to stand with the dissidents because by standing next it is like in government or politics if somebody says they are really for you but they dont want to be identified with you how much are they really for you how much is the bush administration really for the catholic church in clina how much is the bush administration really for the evangelical house church who are putting their lives on the line how much are they for those who are being persecuted in tibet how much are they for the uighurs how much for the falun gong and keep in mind this government is spying against our government much more aggressively than they did in the soviet union i close again with thewords of dr martin luther king in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends if the bush administration wants to be the friends of the dissidents the silence should be broken and clark randt our ambassador in china should be the first one to begin to break the silence"]], "top_unsure": [[4.827976226806641e-06, 0.5000048279762268, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i know that the argument on the other side is that we want people to take personal responsibility but is it fair to say that there is personal responsibility when a company hides thousands of serious adverse effects as was the case with a company that had a product with ephedra in it or when a company does not warn about its risks when companies know about dangers and do not market their product responsibly we are not talking about in this situation a food product that may be heavy in fat or may have cholesterol or whatever people should expect in eating foods generally recognized as safe that if they abuse their eating habits they are responsible for it but with a dietary supplement if the manufacturer withholds this information about the risks and there is no warning whatsoever when the manufacturer knows there should be then it seems to me we are giving up the responsibility of the manufacturer to warn and taking people who are harmed not because they did not act responsibly and then saying to them they are out of luck i would think this is not a good argument that we have heard on the other side and i would hope members would make this exception a food supplement a dietary supplement in the form of a pill or some other process is like a drug and i do not think we would want people to be subjected to no lawsuit that is legitimate if the drug has never been approved and never warned about by the manufacturer so i ask support of the amendment i

praising her for her past actions she was always concerned about the impact on the future for americas children she was the mother of the modern civil rights movement she was the mother of modern society because she made such a change in america with her courage she came to the capitol to receive the congressional gold medal it was a proud day for all of us she brought luster to that award by

opposition to the amendment the gentleman raises a very good issue that deserves attention but we have done our absolute best to fund eradication and control of plant pests in the bill before you today that we are presenting the overall total for plant pests is 115 million which is 16 million over last years level the asian longhorned beetle is at the presidents request of 20 million the glassy winged sharpshooter is at 24 million emerald ash borer 20 million more than doubling last years level of 8 million citrus response is 39 million sudden oak death doubled from last year to 6 million and the list goes on and on eradication and control of these pests is also supported by emergency funding from the commodity credit corporation at the discretion of the secretary the emerald ash borer control just received 7 5 million from ccc last month as for the offset of this amendment it is completely irresponsible to cut funding to farmers rural areas and conservation programs for this gentlemans purpose i would imagine that it would not just be me but there would be members from all across america that are sensitive to the cuts that are being proposed in this amendment it is not just about one district this is about national priorities if the gentleman wishes to look in his own district for offsets new york city benefits greatly from the programs funded by this bill i heard from you and others that funding for the commodity supplemental fielding program was a critical need this bill includes 118 million for that program which the president attempted to zero out of that amount new york city receives 7 8 million and about 30 000 people receive food as a result would the gentleman propose that funding for that program be cut to fund beetle eradication since there is a parochial interest in taking money from one place and putting it in another the gentleman could also propose cuts in funding for wic the feeding program that we all care about and try to take care of every year for atrisk women and children to fund this priority this bill before us today includes over 5 billion of wic funding new york receives about 200 million of that funding every year for eligible women infants and children why are beetles more important what is the priority the point is that there are a lot of choices that you have to make in putting a bill like this together and
