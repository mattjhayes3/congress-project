the veto because i oppose estatetax relief for familyowned ranches and farms or other small businesses in fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country or course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but there is a better way to do it than by enacting this republican bill that is why i voted for the democratic alternative when the house originally considered this bill that democratic alternative bill would have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill it would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over 10 yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough to see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion from 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would have allowed parents to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would have lowered estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for which deserved adoption and which would not have been vetoedwould have provided important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that made me most reluctant to vote for it and that leads me to vote to sustain the presidents veto as the rocky mountain news put it in a september 3rd editorial the republican tax cut is a gamble that the present economic boom isnt going to slow and is fiscally irre mr lantos i will vote today sponsible to uphold the presidents veto of the estate once fully phased in the republican bill tax elimination act would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in rev when this legislation was first considered in enue with no guarantee that this revenue loss the house in june i strongly supported and will not harm social security and medicare in voted for the democratic alternative which was future years presented by congressman rangel of new the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 bil york that proposal called for a significant relion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 duction in the rate of taxation of estates and years but that is far from the whole story be a 50 percent increase in the small business cause of the way the bill is phased in its true exclusion the rangel proposal was a cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up thoughtful and reasonable effort to deal with until after the 10year budget window the legitimate concerns of small businesses that means the full effects of the repub and family farms but it did not have the problican bill will come just at the time when we lems of the legislation which was being urged will have to face budget pressures because by the republican majority my own baby boom generation is starting to when the rangel substitute was defeated retire and if we feel we need to phase in by the house i nevertheless voted for the h r 8 because we cannot afford the full re adoption of h r 8 in order to continue the legpeal now how are

issue of the latino immigration fairness act and the authorizing committee we made every effort to respond to this issue in the authorizing committee but we were denied by the republican majority i would like to support this legislation it is an important piece of legislation but i think it is important to reunite families the same as we did for eastern european families a few years ago this legislation now is the only vehicle to be able to answer the concerns of haitians hondurans and guatemalans and others who were left out we need parity in addition this is the only vehicle that we can support the hate crimes legislation that has been denied to many states in this country i think james byrd jr s heinous murderous deceased condition obviously warrants us passing both the hate crimes legislation and as well this legislation with the immigration fairness act included i ask for my colleagues to vote against this legislation i rise to express my outrage that this house has brought forth the important commercejusticestate conference report to be voted on yet the republican leadership has not felt the need or importance to include language to address the dreadful acts of hate crimes this move by the republican leadership is a slap in the face to the many people here in the united states who have historically been subjected to hateful acts resulting in death bodily harm as well as mental and physical anguish only due to a persons race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we as elected representatives for the american people ignore our duty to ensure that all people are treated equally how can we ignore our moral oath to protect people from hateful acts that arise because of a person race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we allow hateful skeletons of this countrys past to be revived and allowed to infect our society today this chambers silence on the need for hate crimes legislation would do just that and the absence of hate crimes language in the cjs conference report sends the message that this countrys stance on crimes of hate is not a top priority this issue is very dear to me and i am ashamed that after two years from the date of james bryd juniors vicious murder on a paved road in my home state of texas that a bipartisan hate crimes prevention act has not become law time and time again i have come to the floor and asked the republican leadership to support meaningful hate crimes legislation i have introduced my own hate crimes legislation and have supported legislation and resolutions introduced by my colleagues in both the house and the senate yet i find myself coming before the american people once again to compel the republican leadership to include hate crimes language in the cjs conference report in order to increase penalties on perpetrators of hate crimes before the 106th congress comes to a close the same tactics that have been used in the texas state legislature to run out the time in the legislative session to defeat the passage of hate crimes legislation have been used here in the united states congress as well when the james byrd jr hate crimes act was introduced in my home state of texas in january 1999 it was hastily defeated in the state senate and when state democrats attempted to negotiate with republicans in the state senate and the governors administration to get a bipartisan hate crimes bill passed political games were played to extend the process until the end of the state legislative session as i have stated this political ploy was not only used in my home state of texas but it has been used here in both chambers of the united states congress as well we have attempted to negotiate with members of the republican party to get hate crimes legislation passed within the 106th congress however political games and wizardry have been used to delay the process until the congressional session comes to an end i therefore call on the republican leadership with the american people as my witnesses to once again ask for the passage of hate crimes legislation to address senseless killings and crimes of hate and to make a statement that the united states will no longer tolerate these acts since james byrd juniors death our nation has experienced an alarming increase in hate violence directed at men women and even children of all races creeds and colors ronald taylor traveled to the eastside of pittsburgh in what has been characterized as an act of hate violence to kill three and wound two in a fast food restaurant eight weeks later in pittsburgh richard baumhammers armed with a 357caliber pistol traveled 20 miles across the west side of pittsburgh where he killed five people his shooting victims included a jewish women an indian vietnamese chinese and several black men the decade of the 1990s saw an unprecedented rise in the number of hate groups preaching violence and intolerance with more than 50 000 hate crimes reported during the years 1991 through 1997 the summer of 1999 was dubbed the summer of hate as each month brought forth another appalling incident commencing with a threeday shooting spree aimed at minorities in the midwest and culminating with an attack on mere children in california from 1995 through 1999 there has been 206 different arson or bomb attacks on churches and synagogues throughout the united statesan average of one house of worship attacked every week like the rest of the nation some in congress have been tempted to dismiss these atrocities as the anomalous acts of lunatics but news accounts of this homicidal fringe are merely the tip of the iceberg the beliefs they act on are held by a far larger though less visible segment of our society these atrocities illustrate the need for continued vigilance and the passage of the hate crimes prevention act it is long past the time for congress to pass a comprehensive law banning such atrocities it is a federal crime to hijack an automobile or to possess cocaine and it ought to be a federal crime to drag a man to death becauseof his race or to hang a person because of his or her sexual orientation these are crimes that shock and shame our national conscience and they should be subject to federal law enforcement assistance and prosecution therefore i would urge my fellow members of the united states congress and the american people to be counted among those who will stand for justice in this country for all americans and nothing else we must address the problem of hate crimes before the 106th congress convenes

is only 6 in 10 000 american estateswere comprised primarily of familyowned small businesses ranches or farms looking just at our state that means that in 1997 fewer than a dozen estatetax returns were comprised primarily of small businesses ranches or farms of course those numbers only relate to the cases in which an estate tax was actually paid clearly in many other cases families have taken actions to forestall the estate tax i understand that and do think that in appropriate cases we should lessen the pressure that prompted some of those actions as i said the democratic alternative would have provided real effective and immediate estatetax relief to the owners of small businesses including farms and ranches and would have done so in a fiscally responsible way that is why i voted for it in contrast the biggest beneficiaries of the republican legislation are not those middleclass families who own small ranches or farms or other small businesses but instead are very wealthy families with very large assets over the past two decades income and wealth disparities have increased the republican bill while it does have some positive aspects would increase those wealth disparities i find this troubling and it adds to my reluctance to support the bill however i will vote for the bill because the republican leadership has made it clear that it is this bill or no

is about improving the quality of life this issue affects all americans this issue affects every man in america this issue affects every woman in america this issue affects every child in america during the census of 1990 nearly 18 000 residents of my congressional district were not couited i state 18 000 residents of my congressional district were not counted the undercount resulted in a loss of federal dollars and funds that would have benefited nearly 50 million in revenue that would have gone over the past 10 years because we failed to do an accurate count we lost 50 million over the last 10 years 50 million could have gone a long ways in providing much needed resources to my congressional district 50 million would have brought the inland empire roads and infrastructure 50 million could have brought the inland empire housing programs and projects and educational services law enforcement for cities parks and recreation senior citizen services youth centers educational services overall the state of california has lost out on more than 2 2 billion federal dollars and i state overall the state of california has lost out on more than 2 2 billion federal dollars due to the 1990 census undercount last week the lieutenant governor of california cruz bustamante warned that our state could lose 5 billion and i state 5 billion in federal funding if the undercount this year is similar to the 1990 undercount that is why i commend our colleague from new york for urging for an accurate count and demanding an accurate count not only what it means to my state but what it means to many other states across the nation as lieutenant governor cruz bustamante said we will have less than we deserve and i state we will have less than what we deserve this is not just a matter of loss of federal dollars people are being overlooked millions of americans are being overlooked it is a shame that california will not get its fair share of dollars if we do not do an accurate count that is why it is important that we do an accurate count not only for california but for others ten years ago millions of americans were not included in the census count a count that would have placed them equally alongside each and every other american in 1990 2 7 percent of people of california were not counted 2 7 percent 2 7 percent that means one out of every 37 people in california were not counted yet our population continues to grow we have 34 million people or more in the state of california it would be a shame if california did not have an accurate count and it did not receive its fair share of dollars back into our state the census undercount does not affect all americans in the same way again during the 1990 census 7 6 percent of the black population was overlooked in that counting i state 7 6 percent that means one out of every 13 black residents of california were not being counted also during the 1990 census 4 9 percent of hispanic residents of california were not counted that is 4 9 percent that means 4 9 roughly one out of every 20 latinos in california were not being counted imagine what it is going to be like this year if we do not do an accurate count it is a shame if we do not do that it is a shame that the leadership on the other side does not want to do an accurate count i am appalled that governor bush does not want to do an accurate count i think it is important that we all do it in the state of california that we do it in every state i am truly appalled 4 9 percent equals nearly 400 000 latinos in california not counted the last 10 years 400 000 is more than the population of fresno california 400 000 is more than the population of sacramento it is more than the population of oakland 400 000 people not being counted is 400 000 too many however it is not just a matter of blacks and latinos not being counted millions of children also were overlooked over the last 10 years nationwide more than 2 million children were not counted 10 years ago in california alone 342 000 children were not counted in the 1990 census that is 342 000 children imagine the services that could have gone back to our schools to our communities to our state this represents 4 2 percent of the children of california not being counted in 1990 this represents nearly one of every 24 children in california not being counted i join my colleagues here on the floor this evening in urging all americans to stand up and be counted this year i join with those who have been undercounted in the past in stressing the importance of being counted during the year 2000 census all americans should be counted this year if we do not do an accurate count the federal dollars do not come in and the taxpayers will have to pay for the services that we want and deserve i urge all of us to stand up and be counted whether we are white or whether we are american indians african americans hispanic asian americans we should all stand up together and be counted we are one nation a great nation and we are one people together unified and inclusive and i state inclusive and that is important that we are all included in this process and that every one of us is counted filling out the forms and mailing them back is important as the chair indicated that april 1 everyone has received it we urge everyone to return those back and to participate in the process it

this rule and for the conference report but the reason the republican leadership has been forced to resort to this kind of parliamentary game is because the republican majority in this congress has left unfinished the agenda that matters most to the people of this country it is october 12 and there is not an end in sight to this congress and there is little hope left that the real american agenda will be finished thus in order to pass legislation which has overwhelming bipartisan support the republican leadership has resorted to using tricks and games rather than regular order were thij situation not so sad it would be laughable for 2 years democrats in this body have asked the republican leadership for the opportunity to address the issues that matter most to americans real medicare prescription drug coverage real help for americas schools a real and meaningful patients bill of rights an increase in the minimum wage campaign finance reform saving social security and medicare paying down the national debt these are real issues that matter to real people but in those 2 years what have my republican colleagues done they have brought forward legislation that does everything but what the american people want when the republican leaderships position has been soundly defeated on a bipartisan basis they have simply shelved the wishes of the bipartisan majority in this house for example in august of 1999 the house passed a real patients bill of rights a bipartisan patients bill of rights passed it by a vote of 275 to 151 it took the speaker until november 3 of 1999 to appoint conferees when he did he failed to appoint a single republican conferee who supported the bill that passed the house not a single one today that conference has still not reported back to either the house or senate the patients bill of rights sits on a shelf in september of last year the house passed a bipartisan campaign finance reform bill by a bipartisan vote of 252 to 177 that bill has also disappeared into the legislative dustbin of the 106th congress the democrats in this body as well as in the senate have repeatedly asked for further consideration of that legislation but our requests have gone unanswered yet another meaningful bill sits on the shelf in the republican leaderships closet we asked that the house consider legislation that would give seniors a real medicare prescription drug benefit but we were prevented from getting a vote on the democratic version of the bill we have asked that the congress consider legislation which would provide more welltrained teachers for schools across the country in order to reduce class size we have been ignored we have asked for a clean vote on increasing the minimum wage and our republican colleagues loaded up the bill with tax cuts that would benefit the wealthiest while begrudgingly offering a 1 an hour over 2 years wage increase for americans who are at the very low end of the income scale we have asked repeatedly for this congress to consider issues that really matter to real americans the people who pay mortgages who pay rent who make car payments who send their children to school that they want to be safe but we have been ignored so we find ourselves in this situation today while the house has rules which regulate how and when legislation and amendments can come to the floor the other body does not as a consequence the refusal of the congressional republican leadership to consider real legislation that would mean something to real americans the refusal of the congressional republican leadership to sit down and work on a bipartisan basis with the democrats in the house and senate and with the president of the united states has resulted in the need to play these kinds of legislative games we are engaged in today i have long supported reform of our bankruptcy laws i support this conference report it will allow americans who need a fresh financial start to get one but it will also prevent those who have indebted themselves and who are able to pay those debts from just walking away from their obligations this bill affords new protections for consumers by requiring that credit statements include more detailed disclosures it protects the homes of individuals who live in states with homestead exemptions but not those who move there simply to claim the exemption in a bankruptcy it gives permanent chapter 12 relief to farmers many members are concerned about the process quite frankly i share their views it is not proper that the house should be considering this important legislative reform within a shell of a bill that has already been passed and signed into law but given the hour given the inability of therepublican leadership to manage the business of this

this bill that undermines so many of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we

over from the military i am very concerned about the safety of my constituents in light of these recent discoveries of chemical weapons testing kits containing measurable amounts of mustard gas and other toxic chemicals on guam given the public health dangers associated with exposure to these substances i have requested the department of defense to perform a historical record survey to determine the final disposition of chemical weaponry that was brought to guam this survey should be comprehensive and include identifying former military dump sites as well as other potential disposal sites used by the military guam has been a significant area for unitedstates military activity for more than 50 years first used as a major staging area during world war ii the military presence in guam increased correspondingly with the korean and vietnam wars its full value as an area to forward deploy american military forces continues to be strong even in todays postcold war era at the time guam was home to a fully operational naval base naval air station naval communications submarine base air force strategic air command and naval weapons depot and today still has the largest weapons storage area in the entire pacific but over these many years it has become clear that it was military activities during world war ii that posed the greatest threat to the people of guam during world war ii guam was used as a staging area for the invasion of the philippines iwo jima okinawa and eventually as contemplated the invasion of the japanese homeland over time several instances of mustard gas have been discovered and a few months ago officials from the university of guam presented documents to military officials that a huge shipment of mustard gas was brought to guam in 1945 but there has been no documentation of these weapons leaving the island in a september 5 2000 pacific daily news article a spokesman for the army corps of engineers surmised that the shipment had been likely dumped at sea it is illogical because the shipment was brought to guam how could it be taken off and dumped at sea he went on to say that lacking evidence of a definitive area that should be searched the army corps could not conduct a comprehensive search otherwise it is almost like a needle in a haystack however just last week additional chemical weapon cannisters were found with a pile of unexploded ordnance at anderson air force base and these cannisters resemble the testing kits that had been earlier found in the central part of guam in mongmong an area that used to be a military base with these two discoveries of toxic chemicals in less than 2 years i believe that we have in fact found just the beginning of countless needles in the haystack i would have hoped that the first discovery of mustard gas would have spurred the department of defense to engage in this exhaustive survey historical survey of what chemical weapons and what general ordnance was stored on guam left over from world war ii in addition this is combined with another issue concerning the environmental condition of guam and that is the inability to take pcbs out of guam guam and other territories are outside the customs zone and as laws regarding the disposal of pcbs pcbs can be brought to guam from the unitedstates mainland but they cannot be brought back into the unitedstates mainland for proper disposal i remain in strong conversation with epa officials and have received a strong commitment to resolve this problem administratively in the upcoming months however in a neighboring island to the north saipan there were recently discovered pcb materials but the epa has already issued an administrative order releasing those pcb items to be moved back into the unitedstates mainland i think it is a situation that cries out for solution and fair and balanced treatment for all the territories it is important to understand that the toxic substances control act prohibits guam from importing pcbs inside the unitedstates customs zone even though the pcbs originated inside the unitedstates customs zone the unitedstates court of appeals ninth circuits 1997 ruling of sierra club v epa overturned an attempt by epa to solve this problem administratively which would have dealt with pcbs in a more rational manner parenthetically pcbs that are on military bases are easily moved back into the unitedstates this disparate treatment between military bases and the civilian community of guam composed of unitedstates citizens just like everywhere else is simply intolerable and must be resolved by epa in general we have a very difficult situation with pcbs and their disposal in guam we have this issue with chemical toxic weapons i certainly call upon the army corps of engineers and the department of defense to conduct an exhaustive search we first called for this exhaustive search in july of 1999 we continue to press the issue and certainly i hope that the department of defense will see fit to finally review all of the weapons which have been brought into guam and through which two or three generations of people from guam have been raised in the shadow of these weapons"],

which was kind of rushed to the floor and it was hoped that they would get enough votes to send a message to the white house that it cannot be successfully vetoed but of course they failed in that effort the president has promised to veto this bill because at the heart of the bill is an attempt to derail the presidents initiative on more teachers for the classroom especially in grades 1 through 3 where there is a need for smaller class sizes we did get a bill approved an appropriation approved last year which would permit the beginning of the process of hiring more teachers for the classroom virtually 100 000 teachers would be hired under this legislation and 30 000 the process has started as of this month so in order to derail that for some reason the republican majority is against smaller class sizes and they want to take away that priority take away the targeting and they came up with this teacher empowerment act which is not a bad idea the thrust of the bill is to provide a special initiative for the training and professional development of teachers to improve the quality of teachers by itself that is a lofty goal and who could not subscribe to having better prepared teachers in our classroom we want quality teachers but for some reason to get quality teachers the republican majority chose to sacrifice the more teachers for the classroom the act that is designed to lower the class sizes in the first three grades has to be sacrificed put on the chopping block in order to take care of meeting teachers professional development needs and training needs i think that for the republican majority it was more important to derail the initiative to have smaller class sizes than it is really to train teachers the training of the teachers and the opportunities for professional development is secondary for them they are pursuing an agenda and this bill was a part of that agenda to reach a point where all of the influence and direction from the federal government is wiped from the education sphere they want to abolish the education role of the federal government and this of course takes them one step closer if they can take the presidents initiative on class sizes and get rid of that it is one more step toward reducing the federal governments role in education so that bill was on the floor today the republican majority had the greatest number of votes because they are the majority they passed the bill but the number of defections by democrats was not as great as they expected and the presidents threat to veto the bill certainly can hold the bill can be vetoed until something more reasonable is done about the class size initiative of the president there were a lot of good things in the teacher empowerment act by the way it is called teacher empowerment act but all the teacher organizations the n~tional education association the american federation of teachers the grade schools group all of the various education groups opposed it because they saw it as a sabotage operation designed to wipe out the reduction of the classroom size initiative now that bill was on the floor today tomorrow the major bill on the floor will be the tax cut bill and i want to talk about the importance of dealing with the education initiative the education investments should come before big spending tax cuts education investments should dome before big spending tax cuts and it is very important to note that during the whole discussion of the socalled teacher empowerment act today the one thing that the republican majority refused to allow any discussion of was additional funding no new money is involved in their initiative they want to take the money that has already been appropriated for the class size reduction and the money that already exists in various other teacher training and professional development programs and use that in a different way mainly throw it out there to the states let the governors decide how they want to spend that money on education that is the thrust of what the republicans want to do it takes us one step closer to their longterm objective and that is to block grant all funds available for education to the states by block grant i mean take away the federal guidelines take away the federal priorities take away the longterm federal commitment to the poorest districts and the poorest schools out there the federal thrust in education since 1965 since the first elementary and secondary education assistance act in the era of lyndon johnson has been to focus on those areas of greatest need to target the federal money to help with the problem that the states were not able to deal with and chose not to deal with and that is provide a decent education for the poorest students in the poorest schools in the poorest districts so that initiative by the federal government is targeted by the republicans they want to take it away their longterm goal is to wipe out the federal government involvement in education in 1995 my colleagues will recall the newt gingrich program went head on in a direct attack on the department of education they called for the abolishment of the department of education they pursued that for a while it turned out that the american people did not think that was a good idea the voters did not think it was a good idea they retreated and now we have no more talk about abolishing the department of education what we have is instead of the direct assault we have a great deal of warfare going on where they slfip away at the powers they attack at small beachheads that they establish and they find every way to cut into the power of the department of education and into the federal role in education the federal role in education of course is already limited they make it appear that the federal government is responsible for all that is wrong in education it is a very limited role already less than 8 percent of the education funding in this country that is including higher education funding less than 8 percent of that is provided for by the federal government at this point but that is what we had on the floor today another assault on that small role that lessthan8percent role fiscally if one got 8 percent of the funds involved across the country then i think that the influence of the federal government is probably no more also than about 8 percent control is vested in states and local education agencies for education already but that is targeted first they wanted to get rid of it all together now they want to block grant it and turn it over to the governments that is what was on the floor today no item which talked about additional funding was received in an amicable spirit by the republican majority in fact the only amendment that called for fresh funds new money new initiative with new money was the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from hawaii the gentlewoman wanted to offer grants some help for sabbaticals for teachers if one is talking about training then in order to hold certain people into the career path in order to make certain that they have an opportunity for growth somewhere they ought to encourage and help to finance the sabbaticals which already are offered in many local education systems it is an area that was not new but the gentlewoman from hawaii wanted to give more help and called for more money for that that of course was voted down by a large margin and condemned by the chairman and the republican majority no new money is the credo of the leadership of the committee on education and the workforce the republican majority insists that we never discuss authorizing new funding but tomorrow we will be discussing on the floor an expenditure of 864 billion over a 10year period for tax cuts we cannot talk about money when we are talking about education no new money the government is broke we cannot make investments in education but we can have big spending tax cuts that is obvious it is a huge monstrous piece of big spending 864 billion and there is no room anywhere for an investment in education i think my colleagues have heard the previous speaker tonight and they heard the previous set of speakers from the democratic side talk about this tax cut while i am not prepared and do not intend to go into it with great deal i associate myself with most of the remarks made by the gentleman from maryland and his associates their plea was that we not go forward with this monstrous 864 billion tax cut that we look at other kinds of things that ought to be considered at the same time we cannot separate in my opinion the discussion of the tax cut however from the discussion of education they did not do it neither the democrats nor the republicans that talked tonight really placed education on the table for discussion within the parameters of the conventional wisdom here in washington and that sometimes includes the white house when we talk about large amounts of money they do not want to talk about education it is a direct insult to the voters we have poll after poll which shows that education ranks as one of the number one priorities over the last 5 years and recently moved to the very top before social security before defense spending before all of the other priorities which are usually considered education ranked as number one why are the voters being ignored i do not know they can ask their congressman why is it that when my colleagues discuss education they insist that they cannot discuss new money additional resources why is it that theamerican public repeatedly says we would like to see more federal assistance for education but they are only answered with rhetoric about new kinds of changes in the reform programs but none of those new changes have any resources behind them with the acknowledgment of the existence of a huge budget surplus and i do not want to get into an argument about how much the surplus is or what it is going to be over the next 10 years i just know that it is foolish for us laymen who are not involved directly in the calculation process to sit still and watch our leaders talk about huge sums of money that they are going to negotiate on and we question whether it really exists i have some friends who went to a meeting today to hear someone lecture about the fact that there really is no budget surplus and we should stop discussing it i heard that in 1996 when we were on the eve of an election and we had gone through 2 years of the republican majority insisting not only that there was no money for an increase in funding for education but that education should be cut and we had proposals in 1995 that education be cut by almost 4 billion but in 1996 something miraculous happened both parties agreed in the negotiations at the white house that there was additional money available somewhere and instead of cutting education by 4 billion because we were approaching an election where the polls showed that the public wanted more federal assistance for education and the party that stood in the way might suffer and might lose seats suddenly there was agreement the republican majority agreed to an increase in education funding of 4 billion instead of a 4 billion cut we got a 4 billion increase they found the money somewhere now i remember the argument at the time was that we would get the money from sales of the spectrum the spectrum auctioning the auctioning of the spectrum was going to create that money it was not in hand but since both parties of the negotiation agreed it suddenly became a reality the 4 billion that was appropriated it has been spent since 1996 they have been spending the money so i assume that whatever assumptions they made they lived up to those assumptions one way or the other i have not checked to see if we have auctioned off enough of the spectrum to add up to 4 billion but when it came time to make the decision the reality was what the two parties agreed upon if both the white house and the republican majority leaders are saying now that we have a huge surplus that could accommodate over the next 10 years an 864 billion republican tax cut and the president has said well he will entertain some kind of tax cut not that much i assume the surplus is real and the tax cut possibilities are real and they are going to go forward it would be ridiculous for us to sit out the process and not get involved education ought to be put on the table so that it becomes a part of the discussion the doors of opportunity are open for education to be discussed in terms of new resources and new appropriations if the blind men who arein charge here insist that they do not see that as a possibility some of us who are not in charge must sound the alarm we must tell the american people do not sit stilland accept a big spending tax cut while there isno new investment ineducation i hope that my party will rally behind me soon and that they will see the folly of allowing a huge amount of surplus over the next 10 years to get committed to something and it is going to happen there are going to be some commitments of that surplus over the next 10 years we sit still and we let education be left out at this point the forecast for edu cation being included is quite dismal we have a bill which has been set forth by the administration for the reauthor ization of the elementary and secondary education assistance act in their reauthorization proposals they do not propose any great increases in the funding for the ongoing programs in fact there is sort of an understanding that we are going to live within certain budget guidelines there are ceilings that have been set the budget caps as they call them will not be taken off that may all be true in conventional wisdom but if the surplus exists it is folly to assume that they will not in the final analysis be negotiations of some part of the surplus being committed to programs certainly it would be folly to sit still and not commit any part of the surplus to programs and let it all be used for big spending tax cuts the forecast for education right now may be dismal but if we put on our thinking caps if we sound the alarm for the general public the people who in poll after poll show that they think education is important if we let common sense enter into this matter then we can go forward beyond the republican plot to have edflex and teacher empowerment and other kinds of block granting drain off the funds and we would not make any progress in terms of new resources for education there have been some dramatic changes now in the fiscal environment those people who said there was no money available 2 months ago cannot insist that there is no money available now in light of the facts that have been revealed even the budget agencies the congressional budget office they all admit there is a surplus there is an argument about how much of the surplus is from social security funds and ought to be reserved only for social security the lock box theory there is an argument that there are certain amounts of money available and will be available beyond the social security surplus and that that should be budgeted either way either set of assumptions that are accepted there is an acceptance of the fact there is going to be additional money available why not put education on the table why must we accept what the republican majority has offered us on the committee on education and the workforce and on the floor today what they offered us today was a perverted robin hood operation they were going to take only existing funds and scramble them and use them for other purposes instead of having any new funding when they do that what they are doing is taking money away from the traditionally targeted programs which are designed to help the poorest students in our poorest schools and redirect that money away from the poorest schools stealing pilfering from the poor to take care of other sectors and making that the hallmark of their education reform program going to the public and saying this is our answer to their request or their demand for more federal assistance we give them the same money in new forms and we hope that they will be fooled by it but i hope that common sense will not allow us to be fooled that we will insist that education appropriations be put on the table alongside any tax cut spending alongside any spending for shoring up social security alongside spending for health care probably there is going to be a package which contains all of those elements now on may 26 i introduced a bill which deals with one aspect of education which i think is critical in the light of the large amounts of money that were being made available in the surplus now is the timeto discuss it not all the problems of education will be solved by new construction and modernization of our schools although that was on the agenda today we did discuss the need for more technology in our schools and the need for teachers to be trained to utilize technology and how important that was it the modernization process requires that we have money to repair the schools and take care of the old wiring and make certain that they can be wired in some cases some schools cannot be rewired they are going to have to build new schools so construction and modernization ought to be a part of this agenda it was totally ruled out before because of the budget caps and if we take the ongoing budget as it is common sense and conventional wisdom says there is just no money but if we accept the fact that there is going to be a surplus and we talk about large amounts of money like 864 billion for a tax cut then we can also talk about taking this opportunity to plan to spend over the next 10 years or 5 or 10 years money that is necessary to provide adequate schools safe schools schools where there are no health hazards as well as schools that can be modernized to the point where they can make use of modern technology schools can take advantage of the fact that we have an erate which provides a reduced rate for people who make use of technology on an ongoing basis the online services the telephone services 90 percent of that in the poorest of schools would be paid through this erate fund provided by the federal communications commission a lot of things are happening that we need to catch up with by providing more funds for construction and for modernization now on may 26 i called on my colleagues to join me in the cosponsorship of h r 1820 which is an amendment to the elementary and secondary assistance act and this amendment would be germane certainly because there is already a provision title 12 under the elementary and secondary assistance act which calls for money for repairs and construction so we can add if we ever get around to reauthorizing the elementary and secondary assistance act we can certainly add that to the package or if we do not get around to reauthorizing the entire act it is in the law it is the law right now we can amend it to provide for this injection of necessary funding for school construction i am just going to read from my own letter to my colleagues and i have a big heading on top which says that in the year 2000 we launch the march towards a new cybercivilization we are spending 218 billion on highways and roads in 6 years let us invest half this amount 110 billion in 5 years to build repair and modernize schools let me repeat that in the year 2000 we launch the march toward a new cybercivilization a cybercivilization meaning the digital world is taking over the computers are taking over they are everywhere infused in our life and they are probably going to have a greater influence and a greater presence in our lives as we move on recently there was a lot of discussion of the fact that one individual now his net worth is 100 billion this tops all the millionaires and billionaires throughout american history the name of that individual is bill gates now bill gates is worth they say at least 100 billion and his company is worth far more now bill gates does not own any gold mines he does not own any oil wells he does not own any uranium mines all the kinds of things that used to make pe6ple rich are not associated at all with bill gates what does bill gates have that allows him to accumulate 100 billion as an individual and a company worth far more than that microsoft well bill gates is where he is and has the kind of gigantic assets that he has through the application of brainpower it is all about the brains that were used to develop the software in harmony with the computers and then to capitalize on the internet he has been accused of some unscrupulous actions and so forth but that is irrelevant in terms of the basic thrust of what happened here what happened here is that brainpower marshaled repeatedly directed concentrated on certain objectives produced results and the same thing is happening over and over again in numerous hightech companies we are ahead of the rest of the world because we did not have any central committees making rules which said that we can only focus our brainpower on natural resources we are only going to concentrate on mining and oil wells and so forth people who had the knowhow to launch the cyberrevolution went ahead and launched it very young people who are in charge the guys who used to be called nerds or probably similar people are still called nerds in high school and college the nerds triumphed with brainpower it is all about very educated people concentrating their resources and being able to generate wealth so there is a direct association between brainpower and wealth we are definitely moving into a cybercivilization and it is ridiculous for us not to recognize that and to shape our public policy in a way which accommodates the fact that we are moving into a cybercivilization there are some nations like india who recognize this and public policy has produced in india large amounts of people personnel who are in the computer programming arena who are in various stages as computer programmers and document technologists out of proportion to other similarly situated nations india is producing people in the area of information technology with information technology expertise but let me just get back to the appeal to my colleagues that i sent out on may 26 in the year 2000 we launch the march toward a new cybercivilization we are spending 218 billion on highways and roads in 6 years let us invest half this amount 110 billion in 5 years to build repair and modernize schools please join me as a cosponsor for h r 1820 an amendment to the elementary and secondary assistance act which mandates a worthy federal investment in education for the children of america public opinion polls consistently show that our voters consider federal aid to education as the nations number one priority we must now move beyondpaltry pilot projects in our response to this longterm public outcry h r 1820 commits the federal government to make the contribution most suitable to its role through direct appropriations we must make capital investments in school infrastructures offer leadership in the building of schools and then leave the details of the daytoday operations to local and state authorities i have no problem with local and state authorities bding in charge of the implementation but the resources need to come from the federal government because most states and local governmerrts cannot commit the kind of resources necessary to modernize our school systems the way they should be h r 1820 proposes to help all schools by authorizing on the basis of schoolaged children a per capita distribution of the allocations for the purposes of modernization security by the way should be added repair technology and renovations as well as new school construction h r 1820 deserves national priority consideration for the following reasons one the best protection for social security is an educated workforce able to qualify for hightech jobs and steadily pay dollars into the social security trust fund two the effective performance of our military in action utilizing hightech weaponry requires an educated pool of recruits three the unitedstates economy will continue to be the pace setter for the globe only if we maintain a steady flow of qualified brainpower and updated knowhow at all performance levels theoretical scientific technical and mechanical invest in education and all other national goals become reachable invest in education and all other national goals become reachable invest in education and we have a great possibility a greater possibility i do not think social security is about to go bankrupt there are a lot of scare tactics applied to discussions of where social security funds are now and where they will be 50 years from now but one way to assure that social security funding will be there is to have a workforce out there paying into the social security fund whatever else we do and i do not rule out having general appropriations for social security but whatever else we do we should keep the payment of funds into the social security treasury from working people people who are working and if we do not have people who can qualify for the jobs that are going to be available 20 30 40 years from now if we do not have people that have the knowhow to do the hightech jobs the likelihood is that we are going to contract out a lot of our work to other countries that do have the population and the workforce with the knowhow and they are going to pay money into their social security fund and we will have our social security fund deprived of the payment by workers into the fund that is the first source so the best protection for social security is an educated workforce we ought to have a discussion of education on the table when we consider what to do with the huge surplus that is anticipated over the next 10 years instead of being a projected 864 billion in tax expenditures we should say some portion of that money should go for education in this particular piece of legislation the bill i have introduced i only want 110 billion out of the total that is projected even if we have to take the 110 billion away from the tax expenditures that is 110 billion from 864 billion the parameters for the discussion have been set by the majority party they have said we can talk big money we can talk in billions we can talk 864 billion so let us use that as a reference point and say why spend on tax cuts the full 864 billion let us negotiate at least 110 billion over a 5year period to build schools and to modernize schools invest in education there may be additional money we will want to invest in whole school reform which despite the fact that the authorizing committee on education and the workforce did not come up with the program for whole school reform we get high praise for some of the whole school reform efforts that are going forward there are many other places where we may need some investment in education but a large capital expenditure is needed for school construction and modernization and a capital expenditure of this kind is only a onetime expenditure it is not something we would saddle the budget with forever it would not be ongoing we would take care of the problem we would invest in building schools and then we will have a result from that investment a return on that investment later on i think any businessman if he had a surplus and there was clearly identified needs in the area of capital investments would make those investments in order to be able to realize that return in the future the general accounting office told us in 1995 that we needed 112 billion at that time that was 4 years ago we needed 112 billion just to keep the infrastructure at a level which would accommodate the amount of schoolchildren attending school at that time we now have many more children attending school i think we have close to 53 million children out there in schools and what i have just projected an expenditure of 110 billion over a 5year period would be only an expenditure of 416 per year per schoolaged child an expenditure of 416 per child per year over a 5year period so we are talking about a relatively small amount of money to invest in education and guaranty the workforce that we need for tomorrow and that is an appeal i made to my colleagues on may 26 to cosponsor and i recently developed another appeal in light of the changed circumstances that we now know that there definitely is additional money available i projected it before and i said we should get ready for it and we should put on the table a reasonable package which includes school construction i am all for the presidents call for an expenditure of a part of the surplus on medicare i am all for his call of an expenditure of the bulk of the surplus on shoring up social security i am not against that but i think it is a great mistake a great blunder by both democrats and republicans not to put education on the table and make it part of the package but circumstances recently have changed so favorably until i do not see how we can ignore the great window of opportunity that is now open so i prepared another letter which i have not sent out yet i will send it out tomorrow i start with the following heading democrats must respond to the overwhelming change in the fiscal surplus negotiating environment i repeat democrats must respond to the overwhelming change in the fiscal surplus negotiating environment republicans have now ratcheted up their demands for a megabilliondollar tax cut the democratic president has now indicated that he will entertain a tax cut at some level so it is definitely on the table missing from the end game negotiating table is a democratic scenario for school construction and moderniza tion at this moment that is not on the table none of the speakers tonight have talked about education being part of the mix i heard discussions of defense additional expenditures for defense that ought to come out of the surplus and a few other items but no one talked about education although education if you want to consider the national security of the country as being important the first item you ought to look at is the quality of our education including such practical and immediate problems as the workforce required by the military the military requires recruits that are highly educated people who must have had enough prerequisite education in order to be able to go into the military and learn how to deal with a hightech military hightech equipment procedures et cetera youneed welltrained people in the military as much as you need them in the area of information technology so the first step toward shoring up our military should not be new expenditures for equipment like aircraft carriers and b2 bombers and smart bombs but to make certain that the people who guide those smart bombs and who prepare the maps and the intelligence before you drop the bombs do not make a mistake of the kind we made with the chinese embassy in yugoslavia or you have people who are smart enough with their hightech equipment not to be fooled the way we were fooled with the yugoslav dummy equipment wooden weapons and all kinds of things that made us believe that we were bombing their military into ineffectiveness when actually we were hitting very little of their military equipment i do not know why we fell for that trick because we pulled that on hitler when we were projecting openly exposing equipment in the south of france to make it appear that we were going to launch an invasion of the mainland of europe from the south toward the south of france instead of at normandy and the germans fell for that and we are proud of the fact that we pulled that off why we would let yugoslavia pull the same kind of trick on us with respect to equipment that we thought we were bombing i do not know but it points up the need to have better training and a better educated military set of military personnel from the bottom to the top let me continue as i said before missing from the end game negotiating table is a democratic scenario for school construction and modernization h r 1820 an amendment to the elementary and secondary education assistance act authorizes a direct appropriation which is only onehalf the amount authorized and appropriated for transportation not 218 billion but 110 billion or 416 per child per year for 5 years all of the democratic proposals for school reform and education are worthy but nothing proposed is equal to the number one priority ranking that the voters have assigned to education a construction and modernization initiative of this kind fills the vacuum this kind of initiative is a response worthy of what the voters have demanded in poll after poll you have said education should get more assistance from the federal government you do not want to hear an answer that we are going to have a teacher empowerment act which takes old funds away from poor schools and redirects thern spreading them out over the whole country to train teachers better but no new funds are going to be allocated you do not want to hear that kind of response to an overwhelming demand that the federal government play a greater role in providing assistance to education here is a response worthy of it lay these responses alongside of the 218 billion that we approved for highway and transportation last year 218 billion over a 6year period that is about 50 some billion dollars a year for the next 6 years we approved that the authorization committee came forward with it it was not the appropriations committee the appropriations committee was driven by the energy of the authorizing committee today we had the authorizing committee education and the workforce refusing to even ask for additional funding and take to the appropriations committee the priorities that have been set by the american people so we are asking for a worthy response 110 billion over 5 years lay that aside the highway and transportation bill of 218 billion over 6 years and then lay that aside of the new request from the republican majority for 864 billion over 10 years if you get dizzy considering billions of dollars i can understand but at least let us look at the comparisons and understand the framework in which we are operating i have had people say to me when you talk about 22 billion a year for school construction over a 5year period which all adds up to 110 billion over 5 years that is mindboggling it may be mindboggling but we live in a mindboggling era and we are a country of more than 250 million people there are more than 16 000 school districts out there and there are 53 million children out there when you look at the number of children and you look at the amount spent per child we are talking about 416 per child per year maybe that can help you understand the mindboggling figure of 22 billion per year over a 5year period which adds up to 110 billion and then lay the 110 billion alongside 218 billion for highways lay that alongside 864 billion for a tax cut and you are able to comprehend maybe what is going on in washington do you want to stand by and let your government leaders make the blunder of a tax cut expenditure of 864 billion while schools receive zero from a surplus that does exist or we assume exists democrats risk also being upstaged on this because i do not think the majority party is as dumb as some people consider it to be and i do not think this whole process is going to go forward without the majority party waking up to the fact that the people out there are still demanding that the federal government do more for education between now and the next election in the year 2000 i expect some movement on the part of the majority party and i hope the democrats are not going to be victimized by an october surprise like the one we had in october of 1996 when the republicans agreed to an increase in education funding of 4 billion after the republicans had gone for a period from 1994 to the fall of 1996 calling for the abolishment of the department of education wanting to cut school lunches they attacked education vigorously they cut head start they cut title i they went into 1995 and shut down the government because the president would not agree to those kinds of cuts after all that had happened in the fall of 1996 they decided to appropriate 4 billion more for education and they went out and told the public we are the party which supports education and they had enough people to believe that to win back the majority i am convinced that that was a major item a major part of their winning in 1996 democratic refusal to support a meaningful dollar investment in school construction and modernization could weaken our ties to our labor allies and leave open an opportunity for republicans to capture more labor union support i have talked before about the way we treat the working people in this country people look at requests for new money for education for items like school construction or items like whole school reform or any items related to education they look at it and say well thats for minorities thats for people in the inner cities but most of the working families in this country cannot afford to send their children to private schools so we are talking about the public school system and a refusal to direct funding into school building repair and modernization is an abandonment of the public school system and working families are out there who are going to suffer as a result we cannot emphasize too much the fact that the fiscal negotiating environment has undergone a rapid almost revolutionary seachange since the announcement of the longterm multitrillion dollar surplus to adapt to this change and at the same time respond to the number one priority of the voters we urge you to review your position on h r 1820 and sign up for cosponsorship now i am trying to get this new letter out i have some sponsors that we did not have before the minority whip the gentleman from michigan now is a cosponsor of this bill the gentlewoman from california on the appropriations committee is a cosponsor we hope that we can have new momentum that will be generated among those skeptical democrats who did not want to be associated with an appropriation figure which seemed unreal it is not unreal anymore i hope i do not have to repeat why it is not unreal i think that every one of my colleagues republican or democrat can see that 110 billion alongside 864 billion is not an unreal projection of what should be available for school construction now one final specific item about this particular bill h r 1820 we propose to appropriate the money on the basis of the number of school aged children in each state this is a bill that would not be targeted meanstested and that the utilization of it would have great flexibility for security purposes for repair for modernization for technology for construction for renovation there would be great flexibility and it would be appropriated according to the number of school aged children if you look at it in terms of the blanket call for 110 billion it may seem kind of irrelevant to you but let us look at what each state will get if you take the number of school aged children projected for that state for this year and you apply that to the formula alabama would receive 341 million for school construction per year this is the first year each year for 5 years alabama would receive 340 million california would receive 2 7 billion a year for 5 years florida

dogs and perhaps several others today to talk about the budget to talk about debt reduction and as paul harvey says quite often to talk about the rest of the story that which we are not hearing in much of the rhetoric that is going on today the first point i want to make is that through august 31 2000 there has been no surplus other than trust fund surpluses you would not believe that with the carriedaway rhetoric that all of us have been guilty of using of late the 4 6 trillion projected surplus over the next 10 years remember that is projected but more important remember that as of august 31 of this year there still has been no surplus other than trust funds and therefore that is why many of us on this side of the aisle have been arguing that before we spend these projected surpluses that we ought to fix social security and medicare first that we ought to be doing the nations business today instead of adjourning at 3 oclock in the afternoon or completing business at 2 15 we ought to be dealing in the respective committees with how do we fix medicare and the tremendous needs of rural health care why have we been on the floor for the last several weeks talking about tax cuts of 1 3 trillion when you add them all up again spending projected surpluses before we fix social security and medicare again let us calm ourselves and acknowledge the fact that as of august 31 there is no surplus other than trust fund surpluses that is why today the blue dog democrats reiterated the plan that we were talking about at the beginning of this session of congress the same plan that we brought to the floor of the house that got if memory serves me correct 177 votes 144 democrats and i believe 37 republicans joined with us that would be 181 not quite a majority but there was a significant bipartisan group that recognized that you needed a plan if you were going to accomplish all of the rhetoric that both sides take part in from time to time today we come to the floor to discuss in quite some detail the plan that the blue dogs put forward months ago that we reiterate today the blue dog outline demonstrates that it is still possible to reach an agreement on a fiscally responsible budget plan that pays off the debt maintains fiscal discipline and provides substantial tax relief including estate tax relief and marriage penalty repeal the blue dogs have been advocating debt reduction since surplus projections first materialized 2 years ago the republican leadership has adopted blue dog rhetoric in the last few days on debt reduction but only for 1 year and the question we ask today of the leadership of this house is why only 1 year if debt reduction is truly something that we all agree on in a bipartisan way why not do it over a 10year period the blue dogs believe that to be meaningful a commitment to debt reduction must be longterm that is why we are calling on the leadership of this house to extend the principles of their debt reduction lockbox for 10 years under the blue dog framework 3 65 trillion 80 percent of the unified surplus would be devoted to debt reduction over 10 years this would put us on the path to eliminate the publicly held debt by 2010 that is what we say we are for why do we not have policies on this floor that do that which we say why do we continue on having political rallies talking about debt reduction when we really do not mean it except for 1 year that is a question we ask and hopefully someone will come to the floor and answer that question it would be nice to have some simple discussions of these points instead of just one side talking to the other in the absence of the other we will be here by contrast the debt reduction lockbox passed last week would only reserve 60 percent of the unified surplus for debt reduction over the next 10 years blue dogs say 80 republican leadership says 60 and still says we are doing a better job we do not understand that the blue dog framework would result in the budget being balanced without counting any trust funds beginning in 2001 the gentleman from mississippi has been the one that continues to bring the record from treasury source monthly statement of the public debt that anyone can pick up which is what i was talking about when i started my comments today there is no surplus except trust fund surpluses if we are conservative in our approach we can begin paying off the debt without using any of the trust fund surpluses beginning in 2001 if we can only reach an agreement on a 10year debt reduction plan it will establish a foundation that will make it much easier to reach an agreement on significant tax cuts including estate tax relief and repeal of the marriage penalty without jeopardizing fiscal discipline the blue dogs are prepared to work within the 90 10 framework for fiscal year 2001 to balance competing priorities ironically where we have been talking about 50 25 25 for 10 years 90 10 fitg almost exactly with where we believe we ought to be in the year 2001 the blue dogs believe that it is important that congress and the president look beyond the shortterm cost of legislation and keep in mind the longterm impact of budget decisions we make today before agreeing on any tax cuts or new spending programs we need to know how all of these proposals add up over the next 5 to 10 years even if they fit within the 90 10 framework for next year it is important that this congress consider the 10year costs of any tax cuts and new spending initiatives not just the cost in fiscal 2001 likewise once congress and the president agree on the level of discretionary spending for next year and this is what is being fought out it bothered me considerably when i see on the front page of the washington post this morning that members of the other body in the other party are talking about spending is going to go out of the window it should not all we have to do is agree on a framework of what spending should be this year in a bipartisan way working with the white house i believe that is achievable that is the blue dog plan we have looked at the presidents proposals we have looked at the republican budget and we have said somewhere in between is where we need to be close to the middle i think if all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle would look at this proposal we hope they would find the same degree of enthusiasm for it that we bring to the floor today once we get through the 90 10 for 2001 let us talk about the 10 percent how do we propose spending that 10 percent of the projected surplus remember there is no surplus as yet it is projected but we do believe if we stay fiscally conservative with our spending and our taxcutting euphoria that what i am saying today can be achieved we have a projected surplus of 268 billion for fiscal year 2001 ten percent of that is 26 8 billion and that is to be divided between tax cuts and spending divided equally between medicare provider restorations and discretionary spending and tax cuts the blue dog framework would allow a tax cut of 8 5 billion in 2001 and 377 billion over the next 10years this will allow for estate tax and marriage tax penalty relief with room for other tax cuts of 4 4 billion in 2001 and approximately 200 billion over the next 10 years why should we be considering today going home without dealing responsibly with the marriage tax penalty why should we be going home in a few weeks or days without dealing responsibly with the death tax when everyone in this body knows there is a good sound conservative middle ground that would be very appealing to every single small businessman and woman in the united states and give significant relief to everyone above 4 million in estates why would we go home without completing our work devoting an additional 8 5 billion for discretionary spending will provide room to increase spending in the appropriation bills to fund agricultural disaster relief increase funding levels for education health care veterans and military retiree health care all of which have bipartisan agreement that we do need to make some increases in those areas we also provide for 8 5 billion in 2001 to address problems facing health care providers as a result of the reductions of the 1997 balanced budget agreement the kind that our rural hospitals are clamoring praying for the relief so that they do not have to close all of this can be achieved within the framework of debt reduction sincere debt reduction recognizing also that the surpluses that everybody talks about are projected one of the fundamental questions this body should be concerned a little bit about is when we look at this debt that we are talking about onethird of it is owned by foreign interests and the question that we all want to answer i think sooner than later how much longer can our economy continue to grow at the unprecedented rate that it has for the last 8 years how much longer can we go in the longest sustained peacetime economic expansion in the history of our country can we go another 2 months 3 months 6 months 1 year 2 years no one knows the answer to that question but the blue dogs believe that the most conservative thing we can do right now is spend our time discussing how we fix social security and medicare for the future and until we do that let us pay down the debt and let us be very fiscally prudent with the expenditure of our taxpayer dollars that is our message at this point i am glad to yield to the gentleman from louisiana"],

from california for her leadership and good will and good work on this and the gentleman from michigan who has been fighting the right fight on trade issues unfair trade issues for at least this whole decade the gentleman from michigan stood in this hall with me and several others but he was here night after night during the debate on the north american free trade agreement h2742 coi in opposition to it and what he predicted and what he projected absolutely unfortunately has come true in relations with that country and our trading partners that way the gentleman from michigan has a perfect understanding of what is happening with globalization as we walk the halls in this job and go back and forth between committee hearings and meetings in our office and the house floor we have seen more ceos of americas largest corporations walking the halls than atany time of the year every time we vote on china trade relations there are more corporate jets at national airport more ceos walking the halls of this congress when one of them stops and talks to us they invariably say that engagement with china will mean more democracy with china that as we go to china as we trade and engage with them more as we sell them more and buy more from them that democracy will be able to flourish in china they have been telling us that for 10 years when our trade deficit with china in 1989 was 100 million million with an m and today that trade deficit with china with this engagement that we have undertaken with the chinese our trade deficit now is 70 billion with a b 70 billion but they continue to tell us over and over let us do more of this with china more engagement more trade and things in china will get better they tell us that there are 1 2 billion potential consumers in china what they do not tell us is their interest is that china has 1 2 billion potential workers for those american corporations and other western companies that invest in china and sell products back to the united states the real question on globalization and democratization perceived democratization predicted democratization of developing countries like china the real issue boils down to this that as we have engaged more with developing countries as investors have gone into developing countries western investment has shifted from those developing countries that are democracies to those developing countries that are authoritarian governments we see fewer investment dollars going to india a democracy the worlds largest democracy and more investment dollars going to china we see fewer investment dollars relatively going to taiwan and south korea democracies and more investment dollars going to countries like indonesia authoritarian governments in the postwar decade the share of developing country exports to the united states for democratic nations fell from 53 percent to 34 period in other words corporations want to do business with countries with docile work forces with countries where people earn below poverty wages in countries where people are not allowed to organize and bargain collectively in countries that pay 25 cents an hour they have been moving away from democracies into authoritarian countries in manufacturing goods developing democracies share of exports fell 21 percentage points from 56 percent to 35 percent again corporations western investors are choosing to move away from democracies in their investments developing democracies and going to developing authoritarian countries because unitedstates investors like the idea of a docile work force like the idea of workers that cannot talk back like the idea of workers with low wages like the idea of investing in countries where the government is not free where workers simply do what they are told in example after example we can see investment moving from those democracies to countries like china china has certainly been the largest one where that has happened again these ceos that roam the halls of congress these days and tell us that if we engage with china it will mean more democracy in china these same ceos will have us believe that their interest in china their going to china will cause this blossoming of democracy this blooming of democracy in china but look who the major players in communist china today are those people who are the major decisionmakers in the direction that chinese society goes the communist party of china the peoples liberation army in china which controls many of the businesses that export to the united states and western investors which of those three entities the communist party the peoples liberation army or large western companies multinational companies which of those three groups want to empower workers which of those three groups want to pay higher wages which of those three groups want more democracy in china which of those three groups want to change markedly chinese society i submit that none of these three groups want to see change in these societies that is why western investment finds its way into countries like china rather than a country like india if american business investors in china and around the world really want a democracy they would not be going to china they would not be taking development dollars out of democratic countries and putting them in authoritarian states that is why the argument they make that engagement with china will mean a more democratic world and a more prosperous and democratic china is absolutely bogus we as a nation we as a nation have no business rewarding investors that go to countries like china instead of countries like india we have no business taking sides in that sense by rewarding those countries and those investors whose values run very different from ours run counter to ours in this country in this congress we believe in democracy we believe in free markets we believe in people being able to move from one job to another we believe in people being organized and bargaining collectively we believe in the kind of democratic values that made this country great our passing pntr is going to mean more of the same in china more repression more oppression from the government a government that resists democracy because they have the power to we will be making those same entities the communist party the peoples liberation army of china much more powerful if

house today to support the education flexibility act a bill sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware it is a bipartisan bill aimed at giving greater flexibility to local schools to do their job the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms and justifying their existence to the federal government i want them to be educating the children there and doing the job that really matters right now far too often they are filling out the forms and trying to qualify for the money and continually justifying what they axe doing we need to change that we need to shift to local control from one end of this country to the other exciting things are going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education flexibility act that we introduce this week as i mentioned primarily sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware is a critical step i urge all of my colleagues to support edflex pass it as soon as possible and

hosted by the united states in seattle washington from november 30 until the purpose of this meeting is to prepare an agenda for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations aimed at expanding and liberalizing world trade in the wake of the uruguay round of negotiations which ended in 1994 as chairman of the congressional steel caucus i recently convened two days of briefings by unitedstates steel industry executives and the president of the steelworkers of america in addition to discussing the continued threat of lowpriced imports the industry and steelworker representatives also provided the caucus with advice on what should and should not be included ii the agenda which is being drafted in seattle there is general support for this new round of negotiations because liberalized trade has a great potential benefit for the unitedstates economy as long as that liberalized trade is fair and i emphasize the word fair is rulesbased and is market economy based the caucus heard that any future negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization must in no way weaken unitedstates trade laws particularly our antidumping and countervailing duty laws these laws provide essential remedies against unfair foreign imports i am pleased that we have been repeatedly assured by ambassador barshefsky secretary daley and other administration officials that antidumping and countervailing duty statutes will not be reopened in seattle or in any new round of negotiations to follow but we have also heard repeatedly from several of our trading partners that they will seek to reopen discussions on these laws my particular concern arises from an addendum to the wto general council chairman mchurnos draft ministeril declaration for the seattle meeting which he drafted on his own responsibility the proposals in this addendum would seriously weaken the unitedstates antidumping and countervailing duty laws as they stand today although this addendum is not official it indicates that there will be substantial pressure on the unitedstates delegation to include discussions of changes to the antidumping and countervailing duty laws in the new round of negotiations the proposed changes would allow the dumping of goods into the united states and would allow goods to be subsidized by foreign governments these changes in turn would jeopardize united states jobs i will mention just a few of the 24 changes that have been proposed in the mchumo addendum one once an antidumping investigation under unitedstates law is concluded no new petition involving the same product could be initiated for at least a year this means dumping of that product could resume and continue for a year before any remedy could be pursued two if a penalty duty lower than the calculated margin of dumping were thought to be sufficient to reduce the injury then that lower duty would be mandatory even if dumping continues three countervailing duties would be imposed not in the full amount but only in the amount by which the subsidy exceeds the applicable de minimis level four developing countries would suddenly be exempted altogether from the present prohibition on export subsidies and import substitution subsidies these proposed changes sound technical but they would have a dramatic impact on unitedstates jobs in the manufacturing sector and in other important sensitive sectors these changes would mean job losses for many americans and therefore these changes must be resisted i support the viscloskyney resolution stating that the antidumping and antisubsidies code of the wto should not be reopened in seattle i will be part of a delegation travelling to seattle in november as part of the speakers advisory group on the wto ministerial a strong

the congress could override any particular monument designation the congress could reject any particular management plan for a mofiument congress has all the direct authority it needs to have a full debate about lands policy but they do not want to do that because congress has repeatedly shown its unwillingness to significantly alter with monument authority or designation so instead we have a

support of h r 2418 and i say strong support even though i recognize that it is an imperfect solution to what i consider to be a horrible problem we have a serious problem in this country because the demand for organs is much greater than the supply and there are essentially two ways to deal with that problem one is for those areas of the country that feel that they do not have enough organs to essentially raid other parts of the country and try to grab those organs the second option and the option that i strongly prefer and i will have an amendment later addressing this is to be aggressive and work together to increase the supply of organs the problem with the departments rule is that it defies the laws of economics it assumes that economics is not involved in this fight when the reality is economics is at the core of this fight these are hospitals these are businesses big businesses that are fighting over organs because organs unfortunately in this context equate with money so there are situations like my state of wisconsin that will see an essentially 30 percent drop in the number of organs available to them and my neighboring state of illinois seeing a 30 percent increase now chicago is 100 miles from milwaukee and it would not be that difficult for these patients to come to milwaukee but instead of trying to work together what we see is we see from wisconsins perspective a raid a raid on the fine job that we have done in wisconsin to try to encourage more people to donate their organs it defies logic to state that those areas of this country that have done a very good job including my home state of wisconsin in developing an organ procurement network are going to continue working as hard as they have if they are going to see those organs leave the state we have to recognize some basic tenets of human nature and one of those is if one is allowed to keep the fruits of their labor they are going to work harder if the fruits of their labor are going to be sent to another part of this country that increases the chances that they will not work as hard so i think that this bill again is an imperfect bill but i think that the departments response is in exactly the wrong direction"]], "top_unsure": [[6.556510925292969e-06, 0.4999934434890747, 1, "if the gentleman would yield that probably is going down or that number is going up because we have now just seen over the past couple of years the drawout of the medicare plus programs which are the hmo medicare programs that in fact had some kind of a prescription drug benefit and many of those are being taken out of a lot of counties these days across this country so we could potentially see that number go up i think we ought to talk about this when we get into this opposition we now have the facts out we know that they are first in every possible way we can slice it and then what happens to us is we get these comments being made to us well you know if you do this we are going to stop research and we are going to stop people having a longer life because we wont have the research out there for this medicine biotech all of these folks are giving us these scare tactics i think if

trade organization or more recently permanent mostfavorednation status on china which i happened to oppose at the last issue as well as nafta be kept now that a vote has taken place in the house of

lives every day to protect our families and safeguard our neighborhoods last year over 100 fire fighters died in the line of duty the city of worcester massachusetts in my district suffered the tragic loss of six fire fighters on december 3 1999 fire fighters paul brotherton jeremiah lucey timothy jackson jay lyons joseph mcguirk and lieutenant thomas spencer these brave men made the ultimate sacrifice and died doing the job that they loved they left behind 17 children and they left behind a grateful community i would urge all of my colleagues to pick up the july issue of esquire magazine there is an incredibly wellwritten and very moving account of this terrible tragedy which took place in worcester this tragedy brought together fire fighters from across the nation and around the world and we gathered on that day in december to honor their memories and pay tribute to their heroism the best way congress can honor the memory of all fallen fire fighters is by working to prevent such tragedies from ever happening again fire fighters are always there when we need them we need to return this commitment and demonstrate our gratitude for the job that they do and that is why i am proud to offer this amendment with my colleague the gentleman from indiana the building and fire research laboratory at the national institute of standards and technology is in the process of developing fire safety technology that would make firefighting safer recent developments in the area of infrared sight technology would make it possible for fire fighters to more successfully and safely maneuver in a burning structure filled with thick smoke had such technology been available to all fire fighters many recent tragedies such as the loss in worcester might have been avoided and lives could have been saved this amendment would provide the national institute of standards and technology with the funds needed to continue the progress they have al ready made in fire safety research and technology it provides for an increase of 1 million to the building and fire research laboratory at the nist the offset is from the federal bureau of prisons salaries and expense account last year approximately 70 million of the bureaus almost 4 billion budget went unspent and it was our goal to use a small portion of thisoverflow to help protect our nations fire fighters simpl3 put this is a modest amendment that will actually save lives i strongly believe that we have a responsibility to make sure that our fire fighters have access to the most uptodate technologypossible it is the least we can do for these brave individuals who do so much this amendment not only has bipartisan support but it is supported by the national association of state fire marshals in conclusion let me just say that i hope that no member of this congress will ever have to witness what i did in worcester last december 3 nothing we can do here today can change that tragedy but we can take a step albeit a small step toward trying to prevent such catastrophes in the future we on the federal level need to do much more i believe very much more i think we can do much more i urge my colleagues to

have come up in the course of the debate first let me say that i urge my colleagues to vote against this bill because it is beneath the greatness of our country we have an opportunity for peace in the middle east and yet this bill does not include funding to the wye river agreement this historic opportunity when prime minister barak was here we all commended him wished him well and now we have no money to help meet our commitment to the wye river agreement contrary to what has been said here the president did make a request for the wye river funding in his february budget submission so this committee has in a timely fashion had that request not only do we not include the wye river funding we removed the 100 million for jordan a commitment that we made to king hussein with his strong commitment to peace he gave his life for peace and we are removing the funding from the bill while saying all along that it is an emergency that we help jordan through this transition time this opportunity in wye river can be missed if we do not have the money now as i say our colleagues cannot have it both ways they cannot wink at that constituency that is concerned about middle east peace with the idea it will be there later and then say if we put it in today it is coming out of the social security fund that simply is not a straightforward approach to this problem i want to save money
