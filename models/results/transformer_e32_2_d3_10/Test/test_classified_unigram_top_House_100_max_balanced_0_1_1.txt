with so many of my other colleagues in thanking him both for providing this time and for the thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would otherwise have known without the opportunity and privilege of calling sala burton a very

assault on amercas elderly and poor that assault is most clearly and most recently reflected in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding americas most vulnerable"], [0.0029134154319763184,

plus 2 3 million for landsat 4 and 5 and advanced system studies both landsat 4 and 5 are operating beyond their designed lifetime but continue to provide data to users through eosat the additional 23

advanced technology civil earth remote sensing satellite there is plus 6 7 million for severe storm research these additional funds maintain this important research at the fiscal year 1987 level aimed at a wide variety of activities including industry and agriculture and protecting the lives and property of our citizens there is in this bill plus 1 7 million for fire weather agriculture weather and fruit frost warnings these consist of daily forecasts for fire danger rating computations spot forecasts for wildfires and onsite mobile units for large fires within national parklands they include observations forecasts warnings and advisories and issuing of warnings of low temperatures that are especially important in citrusfruitgrowing areas these are services central to the mission of the national weather service and should be maintained finally plus 1 2 million for climate forecast centers these funds are necessary to maintain the current centers these centers are an important link that bring together federal state and private institutions to produce and disseminate climate data and information the committee intends that these climate forecast centers continue and that access to climate data and products be maintained the administrations second objection is that the bill would prematurely authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1989 i cannot agree with this the committee on science space and technology is very familiar with the programmatic and funding needs of noaa for fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1989 and these are covered in this bill there is no need for either the committee or the house to devote additional time to noaas fiscal year 1989 authorization finally the administration objects that the bill would impose restrictions on the department of commerces ability to manage effectively the national weather service through closings or consolidations of offices all the bill requires is certification from the secretary of commerce prior to any closing consolidation automation or relocation of any weather service office this provision does not in any way hinder the secretary from taking such actions but only that congress be notified in advance it should be noted that the national weather service has proposed to close 7 offices and reduced staffing in 21 other offices in each of the last 3 years without success because of congressional actions by establishing a procedure for such closings or consolidations the committee has improved rather than hindered the departments ability to manage the national weather service in summary i cannot agree with any of the administrations objections to s 1667 i want to reaffirm my strong support for the bill and i urge my colleagues to vote for it"], [0.9868767261505127, 0.9868767261505127, 0, "the house

integrity of their government we must also act expeditiously to avoid paralysis of government and to ensure that america remains strong in its relations with foreign countries accordingly i strongly supported the preliminary investigations done by the foreign affairs and intelligence committees and i applauded appointment of an independent counsel i fully support the need for the house iran committee investigation the interests of the nation lie in getting all the facts of the iran initiative quickly getting them out to the american people and taking corrective action the interests of the nation also lie in protecting our national security secrets in my view this resolution comes up short on both points the resolution requires the iran committee to report to the house by halloween thats too long to wait various committees of the house have already done much of the basic spade work in the investigation which enables the iran committee to complete its work expeditiously it should be required to make every effort to complete its work by april 15 if developments so required it could ask the house for more time there is no justification for the holdup this is an investigation of arms sales to iran and diversion of related fundsthis is not an investigation of the past 6 years of the reagan administration we should finish by april not drag on until october can you imagine what the reaction of this house would have been if the president had said were looking into the matter but we wont let the american people know until october the resolution also defines an outlandishly broad scope for the investigation the issue facing the country is the iran initiative including arms sales and the disposition of the money generated by those sales if the majority wants a general review of the administrations support for freedom fighters around the world under the reagan doctrine or the activities of friendly countries the standing committees of the house are the appropriate forums the iran select committee should focus quickly and effectively upon the matters at issue which concern the american peoplethe iran initiative iran arms sales and what happened to the money paid for the arms moreover it approaches an abuse of congressional power to authorize the iran committee to look into the tax returns of americans all the way back to 1980 the resolution also sets a poor example for spending taxpayers money the resolution provides for openended spending the house at least ought to set an initial budget ceiling for the committee if events so required the committee could seek more money from the house later the most grave concern is that the resolution fails to provide the necessary protection for national security secrets the resolution grants the committee a right of access to such secrets as communications intercepts intelligence funds transactions and national security council proceedings the committee may need access to relevant parts of such material to do its job but the resolutior should mandate the protection for such secrets equivalent to that required for the intelligence committee the resolution should also provide that no committee member or employee of the house can disclose publicly any classified information possessed by the iran committee without the committees approval the committee should not give such approval until it first gives notice to the president with an opportunity for him to explain the effect of the proposed disclosure on the national security if the president objects that the disclosure would damage national security then the information should not be disclosed unless the house votes to approve such disclosure the nation cannot afford another church and pike committee exercise in which leaks damaging to our nations diplomatic and intelligence efforts appear daily in the press on a final matter the answer to a key question has eluded preliminary investigations what happened to the arms sale money it appears that only lieutenant colonel north knows the iran committee should soon consider obtaining a court order compelling colonel north to tell us what he knows that order woudl protect against use of the testimony against him and would produce the information that we need i speak out against this resolution with regret the congress and the president share a responsibility to investigate this matter both thoroughly and expeditiously the president is doing his part with his efforts to get the truth out and make all information available the house should do its part by providing a carefully

numerous archeological natural cultural and fish and wildlife resources particularly the flying foxes the park would encompass approximately 8 200 acres including large areas on the islands of tau and tutuila and a small coastal area on ofu when this legislation was introduced in june of this year i was pleased to join as an original cosponsor as i recognized the importance of preserving tropical forests and their unique wildlife i have been fortunate to deal with insular issues affecting samoa since i fiist came to congress my work has taken me to samoa where i have witnessed the beautiful and diverse flora and fauna of the islands and coastal areas i was equally impressed by the tospitable and proud people of the territory of american samoa they have good reason to be proud the tropical islands of samoa are an often overlooked scenic natural resource of the united states american samoa has one of only three tropical rain forests under unitedstates jurisdiction puerto rico has the beautiful el yunque hawaii has the highly vulnerable forest in the hawaii volcanoes national park and american samoa has the third the diminution of tropical forests worldwide is accelerating with numerous adverse impacts on our environment there exists a considerable amount of interest in the congress as well as elsewhere in the government and among private organizations to stem stop or even reverse the decline of world tropical forests it appears to me that we should first do whatever we can to preserve our own tropical forests a very important factor in sustaining the tropical forests of samoa is a small and often misunderstood animal pteropus samoenis or flying fox a symbiotic relationship exists between these little animals and the tropical forests they need each other to survive the flying fox helps to pollinate the trees and the forest provides safe refuge it is anticipated that a national park would help protect the forests and the flying foxes so that both will continue to thrive and contribute to the environment in our exuberance to establish a park and preserve the forest we have been careful to remember first and foremost the people of samoa they know their islands better than anyone the culture of samoa revolves around the land and respect for nature in agreeing to the cession of the samoan islands of tutuila aunuu and the manua group the chiefs requested that the indigenous ownership of lands by samoans be preserved therefore the legislation provides for the secretary of the interior and the governor of american samoa to enter into a 50year lease of the lands and waters in the park with the option to extend the lease on or before its expiration if the lease is not extended the administration of the park would be transferred to the governor the secretary and the governor would negotiate the amount of the lease payments which would be disbursed by the governor to the villages and families located within the park the high court of samoa would determine the amount of the payments to individuals thus the park would be established without federal ownership of the land prior to the establishment of unitedstates jurisdiction in samoa in 1900 the samoan people had inhabited the islands for thousands of years the people had long recognized the vulnerability of animal and sea life and had incorporated strict conservation methods as part of their way of life in addition it was customary for the chiefs to monitor the population sizes of various species of fish once the number of fish neared the threshold of endangering the continuing viability of the species a temporary ban on taking that type of fish would be instituted the ban which is called tapu in samoan would not be lifted until the chiefs determined that an adequate population base existed given the samoans historical concern for the environment it is not surprising that there is widespread support in samoa for a park that would continue to preserve the islands natural resources under h r 4818 the park will also seek to potect the traditions and customs of samoa subsistence farming and subsistence reef fishing as have been traditionally used in the past will be allowed to continue in addition the access to park areas will provide for the traditional subsistence harvesting of breadfruit coconuts yams kava wild fruits and vegetables and plants for medicinal purposes the park will also permit the careful and customarily limited extraction of native trees to be used in traditional samoan houses and ware as land in samoa is such an important issue the legislation provides that the boundaries of the proposed park area will be clearly defined and mutually agreed to by the governor and respective villages before publication of the park maps h r 4818 also requires the secretary of the interior to develop a program to train native american samoans to work in the park and to extend a hiring preference to these individuals to ensure that the park employees are familiar with the samoan islands the people language and traditions i am confident that there are adequate native american samoans as clearly defined in the bill qualified to meet the staffing needs of the park the real employment opportunities that the national park offers however will be generated from business established in samoa to support the increase of visitors the villages families and individuals of american samoa can provide tours food and lodging as well as other services to visitors to the national park of samoa a great deal of time and effort have been invested by many individuals and organizations to help make the dream of a national park of american samoa to become a reality the national park service conducted an excellent study and recently transmitted a superb draft report to congress with recommendations for the park the chairman of the subcommittee mr vento certainly deserves recognition for his hard work on this legislation as well the subcommittee traveled to samoa last year to inspect the areas of the proposed park hold a hearing on the issue and moot with several of the high chiefs and local officials to obtain their views concerning the park i would clearly be remiss if i did not commend dr paul cox and dr merlin tuttle renowned experts on the flying fox and tropical forests dr cox and dr tuttle along with mr verne read have worked extremely hard for several years to achieve their goal of creation of a national park in samoa i am pleased we have boon able to assist them in their dedicated efforts i believe we have a unique opportunity to join with the people of samoa in the proservation of the third major tropical forest of the united states by the establishment of the national park of american samoa the establishment of the park under h r 4818 would assist in the conservation of samoas wildlife such as the flying fox and the variegated marine life of the islands reefs in a manner consistent with the

begin by commending chairman hawkins for undertaking the compilation of a comprehensive and informative twovolume report entitled the chairmans report on children in america a strategy for the 100th congress volume i sets forth a strategy for this congress to consider as it acts upon legislative initiatives that will have a major impact on the lives of our children and their families volume ii in turn provides a wealth of information on a host of federally assisted programs which seek to provide necessary services for our children included are descriptions of programs which address the need for quality education opportunities for selfsufficiency the right to a safe and livable environment and services that will ensure healthy minds and bodies i shall focus my comments and observations on our network of child nutrition programsprograms which in my judgment play a key role in ensuring that our nations children first do have healthy minds and bodies and second are better able to obtain a quality education what is the current status of our child nutrition programs as the vice chairman of the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity limited resources to the end that we meet our commitment to providing for the nutritional wellbeing and improved educational opportunities afforded to all of our children what is at stake has been eloquently stated in the current offering of letters for women infants and children in the usa being conducted by bread for the world children are our future au of them while adequate diets wilu not compensate for the great differences in access to opportunity between those who have and those who do not it is a start food can enable some children to survive and many others to make better use of educational and economic opportunities food is

reconciliation package was crafted entirely by the house democrats this bill was put together before the recent economic crisis which prompted congress and the white house to begin serious negotiations to reduce the budget deficit the democratic plan imposes burdensome tax increases and several billion dollars of additional spending the bill includes only 1 billion in real savings this legislation has no place on the agenda at a time when our deficit is approaching 200 billion last month i voted for a serious effort to cut the federal deficit its provisions require 23 billion in automatic spending cuts if congress fails to agree on a specific program to deal with the deficit by november 20 i hope it doesnt come to that at a time when we are facing instabilities in the world markets it is essential that both parties work together and show a united front to the rest of the country this reconciliation bill as it now stands crafted solely by one party and filled with phantom savings and gimmick solutions sends the wrong signal from washington and could jeopardize the current negotiations and create further turmoil in the markets as a republican on the house ways and means committee i was locked out of the democratic caucus negotiations which produced 14 billion in new taxes for inclusion in the fiscal year 1988 reconciliation bill the bill contains 14 4 billion in deficit reduction of which 13 26 billion is new taxes and other revenues my position has been and remains that budget savings should be a major component of any deficit reduction package tax increases cannot be the primary source of revenue at the very least a bill proclaimed as a step toward reducing the federal deficit should not include major additional expenditures the point of this reconciliation bill is to reconcile budget numbers with appropriations numbers how can this be accomplished successfully and fairly when the majority party insists on weaving program expansions into the bill and disguising shifts in expenditures as real policy for example are we really expected to believe that labeling frozen pizzas as containing real or substitute cheese will save 29 million over 3 years or that shifting 1 2 billion in farmers income subsidy payments from the beginning of the crop year into the next fiscal year represents real savings or that charging cruiser fees of at least 250 000 for every vessel escorted through the persian gulf by the unitedstates military is a proper way to raise 95 million at a time when such unrest exists in that region the same bill also contains 7 5 billion in new federal spending primarily welfare reform a policy which ought to be debated separate and apart from legislation designed to establish overall budget goals the budget reconciliation bill as it now stands represents a missed opportunity to take meaningful action to reduce the federal deficit i would have welcomed the opportunity to participate with my democratic colleagues on the ways and means committee in devising real budget savings for example we missed an opportunity to take action to reduce evasion of gasoline excise taxes in july 1986 the subcommittee on oversight held hearings on evasion of gasoline excise taxes the subcommittee and later the congress concluded that evasion was rampant and losses to the treasury totaled between 500 million to 1 billion annually to capture that revenue congress moved the collection point for the tax from the wholesale distributor or jobber to the terminal effective january 1 1988 based upon the vast experience new york state has had with evasion of state gasoline taxes i worked this year to improve that measure and to move the collection point further upstream to the beginning of the petroleum distribution systemthe refinery gate and the first point of entry into the united states however the committee did not adopt this provision unfortunately it substantially reversed its 1986 action the bill now before the house would make the taxable event removal of the gasoline from the terminal and would permit thousands of jobbers to remit the tax this measure is a serious mistake it would undercut the good work of the tax reform act it would result in greater inefficiency and opportunities for evasion in the tax collection system there will be a serious loss of revenues to the treasury every year the reconciliation bill becomes a vehicle for chicanery the deceptions have reached a new high in 1987 the bill is filled with concocted cosmetic changes that will score as budget reductions when in fact they do not impinge on program operations and do not result in budget savings the recent turmoil in the market has shown me that we must make a responsible effort to reduce the
