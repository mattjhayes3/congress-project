budget forecasts should remember george bernard shaws famous quip about second marriages the triumph of hope over experience while i heartily applaud the presidents emphasis on deficit reduction like the famous irish writer i urge my colleagues to focus on experience the problem is the underlying principles of the clinton plan that tax increases will reduce the deficit flies in the face of precedent recent history shows higher taxes lead to more federal spending lower economic growth fewer jobs and ultimately larger deficits we saw budget agreements and this chart reflects those budget agreements that resulted in massive tax increases in 1983 1985 1988 and 1990 in each case you can see from the charts more spending and larger deficits resulted from those tax increases chairman obeys own chart showed us that it was only in the years when congress was forced to restrain spending under the grammrudman act did we see any slowdown in this pace of runaway federal spending and that is reflected in chairman obeys own chart that he has presented us under grammrudman total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 1 1 percent under the 1990 budget agreement with its supposedly stricter than grammrudman spending controls total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 8 4 percent the proof is in the pudding as you can see from this chart here the grammrudman record clearly shows that seriously restraining congress ability to spend is the only real way to achieve progress on the deficit in addition i think it is important to point out actual tax revenues since the 1990 budget deal have fallen by more than 3 25 for every dollar the deal is supposed to raise and the deficit increased from 3 1 percent of gnp in 1990 to 5 percent in 1992 every economic study you look at shows that every dollar in new taxes raised since 1947 has led to 1 59 in new government spending a recent study by citizens agonst government waste showed that the 1990 budget agreement produced 2 37 in new spending for every dollar raised in new taxes that is hardly a formula for real deficit reduction experience shows that excessive government spending not a lack of tax revenues causes massive deficits revenues to the federal government have remained steady at an average of 18 6 percent of gross domestic product between 1965 and 1992 never falling below 17 5 percent at the same time government spending has risen from 17 6 percent of gnp to 23 5 percent in 1992 even more telling tax revenues have grown annually at an 8 percent rate over the past decade but spending has increased at an annual rate of 11 percent during the same time the clinton plan is more of the same with deficits the administration projected to average 250 billion a year and their analysis does not even reflect the blow to the economy of taking 328 billion out of the private sector out of the revenue stream in new taxes 328 billion these new taxes will stifle economic growth destroy jobs reduce revenues and increase the deficit economists across the ideological spectrum are convinced that the clinton tax increases will lead to widespread job loss let us look at a few of their comments david resler of nomura securities puts the cost at 400 000 lost jobs by the end of 1994 from these new tax increases drimcgraw hill says 700 000 jobs will be lost in 1997 and 1998 larry kudlow the chief economist at bear stearns estimates job losses at 3 2 million by 1996 and a reduction in real economic output of 450 billion we are going to have unfortunately i think the votes are there for the huge tax increases and we are going to see the prophecies of these economists realized constricting the economy with higher taxes not only means additional job losses less revenues from taxes higher expenditures for unemployment claims but ultimately larger deficits we all remember the infamous boat tax hike in the 1990 budget agreement that illconceived and shortsighted proposal not only failed to reduce the deficit despite the claims from many that it would do just that but it actually lost revenue the boat tax actually lost revenue because it threw thousands of workers out of their jobs as we now know the government lost the income tax revenues from these workers and increased spending on their unemployment claims the experiences of economies across the globe show that higher taxes and more government lead to longterm economic sluggishness we simply cannot grow the government without seriously stifling the private sector at the same time that the government gets bigger these tax increases stifle the productive private sector and destroy jobs we will not balance the budget or even make a dent in the deficit unless we allow the private sector to operate as the engine of economic growth i hope we can learn something from these economic lessons learned throughout our history economic lessons learned in couptries from mexico to poland but unfortunately lost on many of the politicians in this body when will they learn that free markets less government spending and low taxes are the only solid foundation for real economic growth 1 i urge my colleagues to support real

grave one hundred and thirtytwo years ago today he signed into law the nations first income taxdesigned as a temporary emergency measure to finance the civil war today president clinton is raising taxes to finance his version of a class war of course the administration is not without admirers one master of illusion the great houdini must be smiling down on this chamber today when we blow away the smoke and shatter the mirrors what we get from president clintons taxandspend road show is nowhere near what he claims not the 496 billion in deficit reduction not if we use the cbo numbers because cbo based on their estimates would score it at best at 428 billion in deficit reduction even that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of slower spending growth 4 or 5 years from now and then that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of lower spending in the fourth and fifth years this is the president who said we have all got to use congressional budget office estimates they are the real estimates and we have got to reject accounting gimmicks then he ignored cbos baselines and had his bookkeepers invent their own and counted savings from the 1990 budget agreement twice in order to puff up his deficit reduction numbers and i do not know if that is smoke and mirrors or what but if an accountant on main street did it he probably would go to jail that fact is this package includes about 120 billion in promises of net spending reductions almost all in the third fourth and fifth year 255 billion dollars worth of real net new taxes and user fees and about 53 billion in questionable debt service claims that is what you get when you lay this package against cbos estimates instead of the ones the administration cooked up there will be no net spending cuts in the first year zero and virtually none in the second year this package includes deficit increasing items totaling 62 billion over 5 years this new spending probably seems odd to the american people in a socalled deficit reduction package it is one of the reasons why they are nervous about this bill the largest tax increase in our nations history yes the largest by cbo estimates new taxes in this bill are 275 billion the democrats dispute this and they talk about the 1982 tax act but the cbo scored the 1982 tax act as raising 3214 billion in new taxes instinctively americans know these new tax increases are jobkilling poison for the economy they do not believe for one minute that the democrats tax increases are going to create jobs nor do most of the economists in this country the president claims the vast majority of these taxes will hurt only the rich and that is baloney he must not have read his own bill the socalled rich who are targets for massive retroactive tax increases are the small business men and women who create the vast majority of new jobs heaping higher taxes on those jobs creators translates into fewer jobs for working people perhaps we should remember the socalled luxury tax from the 1990 budget deal it is repealed in this bill because that misguided class warfare scheme backfired and killed the boatbuilding industry try to sock the rich and you drown working men and women simplistic attempts to minimize the impact of the energy tax on american families will not hold water either when the democrats tax transportation they are not just taxing people who pull up to the gas pump they are taxing everything that has to be transported senior citizens are among the hardest hit in this package thanks in particular to increased taxes on their benefits it must make them feel real special to learn that president clintons definition of rich people includes seniors with incomes of just 34 000 and that includes half of their social security benefits now that sounds pretty callous especially since seniors on fixed incomes are the one group of americans for whom lower interest rates serve as a financial curse rather than a blessing yes president clinton would like the american people to believe his own taxes only hurt rich people but with over 40 tax increases and 16 user fees in this package no one should seriously buy that story here is what the taxpayers do understand when he was courting their vote clinton promised the middle class a tax cut now he is raising their taxes he promised to create jobs now he is promising tax increases on employers that will kill jobs he promised 500 billion in deficit reduction he is at least 73 billion short of that at best all of the rate increases in the bill including estate taxes are retroactive to january 1 potentially unconstitutional and the installment payments gimmick for individuals does not change the bottom line he is imposing tax increases on people who have already died i urge my colleagues in the house to reject this bill today let us solve our deficit problem through spending cuts up front not tax increases"],

happened with this october surprise investigation when the democrat majority first pressed for a task force to investigate these charges i said the majority is offering an unacceptable resolution for an unnecessary investigation into unbelievable allegations based on unsubstantiated claims made by unsavory characters now after an 8month investigatlon at a cost to the taxpayers of 4 5 rrlion the october surprise task force conclusively refuted all alegations nde by the proponerls of 1he october surprise conspiracy theory i hate to tell you i told you so but i told you so i belileve now and i have always beleved that thi investigation was not necessary we were told by th majority tvhi there were trowbing llegations those allgatons were not troubling there were preposterous both newsweek and the new republic concluded as much in detailed investigative reports before the democrats even started this committee there is a curious aliceinwondarend logic about all of this first there were a number of october surprise conspiracy theories reported in the media these theories fed off each other repealing the same myths and fentasles in different ways taking unproven assertions and claiming they were undeniable facts quoting dubious sources playing up anything that could damage the reagan campaign team playing down anything that would damage their own case al the sordid ancient ticks of the conspiracy trade but simply by being reported and commented upon in the politcay correct media outlets ihat is the new york tames public television et cetera the conspiracy theories were said by democrats to raihe questions that needed to be answered once that claim was made it was inevitable that a congress dominated by democrats would be asked to provide the answers particularly since it was the antirepublican conspiracy theorists themselves who primarily did the asdng so the house had a costy investigaton based on nothing more than the claim that questions had been raised but questions are raised all the time in the media theories about secret powerful cabals of sinister puppet masters abound why was this particular theory dragged out for so long in the press paid such respectful attention and finally made the subject of two congressional investigations the fact that the questions were raised by disgruntled democratic party partisans shady characters and worldclass international liars was rarely mentioned by democrats when democrats were accused by republicans of partisanship in asking for an investigation based on unproven allegations they held up their hands in pious horror and exclaimed but questions have been raised we must investigate as if they rush to answer all conspiracy theory questions as matter of principle shorn of its sensationalism here is what happened reaganhating political activists and scoundrels concocted a libelous story claiming that ronald reagan or his aides or both deliberately used the hostages for their own political purposes the media reported the story and gave the theorists forums from which to spread the ibel because the story had been reported democrats said there are questions that must be answered and a congressional investigatory committee was formed and funded the theories were as i have said groundless is this going to be the investigative model for our future in the house will the democratic leadership always call for an investigation of conspiracy theories no manner what the source so long as questions are raised will we see democrats rushing to the floor or secretly enlisting the gao to investigate conspiracy theories about president clinton if and when such theories appear if some disgruntled republican who served in the bush administration manages to get a large part of the oped page given to him of the new york times as mr sick dkto offer a wacko conspiracy theory about the president clinton will democrats say questions have been ralsedl and call for an investigation i watch and wait with patient expectation it is also interesting to note the timing of the release of the report i can guarantee you one thing if there had been one bit of evidence that the reaganbush campaign was indeed involved the information would have been on every front page across the nation before the election instead the report concluded that there was no credible evidence of a conspiracy and it was released following the election i commend mr hamilton the very distinguished member from indiana who did a fine job in leading this investigation but lee hamilton should not be forced to waste his valuable time tracking down erroneous outrageous ridiculous allegations he should spend his time on the substantive things he does best things like heading a task force on congressional reform in fact investigations like this should be an item for the joint committee on the organization of the congress we should have better procedures in the house so that we can make certain that we dont form committees to investigate every wild conspiracy theory that hits the halls of congress we should also have a requirement that the minority is always kept informed of gao investigations initiated by the majority we should also prohibit staff from writing to federal judges urging them to release convicted felons from prisons because they proved helpful with secret investigations i appreciate the role that henry hyde both as the republican leader of this task force and as a force for reason during the entire debate i would like to thank him for reminding us all through this special order that the october surprise task force was formed not because the majority wanted to answer troubling questions from credible sources but because there are some who want to cast a shadow on one of the greatest presidents in our history i think the formation of this task force not the work product of the members of that task force symbolizes much to what is wrong with this house after

wholeheartedly behind that is the north american freetrade agreement i happen to believe very strongly that it is going to be one of the greatest jobcreating mechanisms that we can possibly put into place following along the lines of what was just offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania i would like to say that i stand here once again with a very bipartisan spirit that bipartisan spirit is a desire to try to implement a jobcreating mechanism in this economy over and above the north american freetrade agreement now i liketo pride myself on first being an american and second a republican and i was not a supporter of president clintons when he was a candidate last fall but i was frankly very impressed with more than a few things he said in his campaign and i would like to spend this evening talking about one of those items which he referred to in his campaign i want to talk about the fact that we unfortunately are not utilizing that campaign promise in this reconciliation package which we are going to be considering later on this week i happen to believe that president clintons statement last year that a capital gains differential was very important to job creating and economic growth was a correct one it is one which i have subscribed to all along and based on every bit of evidence that we have seen it is clearly going to play a key role in creating job opportunities in this country now as has been said earlier the president is going to be going on television this evening and he is going to be bringing forth urging the american people to contact those of us members of the congress to support his plan i will say here that while i am a strong supporter of many of president clintons initiatives i will do everything that i possibly can to defeat his plan that he is going to be talking about later this evening because even though he talks about an economic growth component and stimulating small business this plan does anything but that based on the evidence that we have seen in the past now i happen to believe and i made this statement earlier that we in the minority clearly have to offer a very positive economic growth component and in fact shortly after we defeated or after i voted against the initial budget package that the president had and many in the media were saying that republicans were simply trying to block president clintons initiatives they were not offering any positive alternative i introduced h r 1885 a basic 4point plan designed to create jobs stimulate economic growth and bring down the deficit the 4 points include first and i am going to be talking about it in just a couple of minutes a capital gains differential taking the 28 percent capital gains tax rate reducing that to 15 percent second imposing a moratorium on the promulgation of new regulations on the business sector of the economy we know full well that many of the problems that are created in this country come about in large part due to the burden of federal regulations that are imposed on the private sector and under the bush administration we opposed a 90day moratorium on new regulations for the business sector of the economy and there were no catastrophes as a byproduct of that so the second part of the proposal that i have in h r 1885 extends that moratorium on new regulations for the business sector of the economy the third thing that it does very importantly as we look at the deficit and the national debt it imposes what is called the 2 percent solution which is close to a freeze on federal spending and we all know that trying to bring about a freeze in the area of federal spending could go a long way toward turning the corner on that debt and the fourth point is as i said earlier establishment or expanding of individual retirement accounts in the 1981 tax bill which was the only tax bill that i voted for it was known as the economic recovery tax act and we established individual retirement accounts those individual retirement accounts were designed to encourage people to plan and save for retirement put dollars aside so that they would not have to be totally relying on the social security system or other government programs for their survival so what i have in h r 1885 is an expansion of individual retirement accounts allowing for a spousal contribution to that individual retirement account and withdrawals from that individual retirement account for three basic uses first a new home purchase which obviously is very important as we know that the housing industry has historically played a key role in pulling us out of recession second the purchase of very needed health care we are looking at health care reform and it seems to me that being able to withdraw form an individual retirement account would be very beneficial as we look at health care reform and the third thing is education we know that many people are decrying the very sorry state of the educational system in this country and one of the things that i call for in h r 1885 is a withdrawal for education purposes for postsecondary education so it seems to me that this 4point economic package would go a long way toward dealing with the challenges that we have and it is contrary to what many in the media and some on the other side of the aisle have said a positive alternative to the one that has been brought forward and the one which most on our side of the aisle strongly oppose now i want to take a few minutes to talk specifically about the issue of capital gains and the effect that a capital gains tax cut has had in the past and will continue to have first of all if we look at the overall tax rates since 1946 tax rates marginal tax rates have fluctuated from 91 percent at a high to 28 percent and revenues have basically as a percentage of the gross national product remained constant at 19 5 percent we have clearly demonstrated that the only way to increase revenues to the federal treasury is to expand the economy now my friend the gentleman from pennsylvania fias talked about the fact that this gasoline tax increase and other taxes that are in this proposal which the president is going to be talking about in a couple of hours is one which will lead the economy to constrict now how we can possibly expect to deal with the national debt and the federal deficit if we have not an expanding economy but a shrinking economy is really beyond me because most every small businessman and woman and many many others even in big business not withstanding those who went down to the white house the other day to support the plan have indicated to me and to others of our colleagues that we must have growth components there and according to the date that we have gathered from the joint economic committee and from the internal revenue service one of the very best ways for us to gain tax revenues to the federal treasury so that we can turn the corner on the 4 5 trillion national debt and the hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits that we run up each year would be to put into place a meaningful capital gains tax stimulus now in 1978 the top capital gains tax rate was lowered from 50 percent to 28 percent as a result of that tax rate reduction in 1978 we saw at that point an increase in revenues to the treasury from 51 billion to 32 billion in 1986 i would like to ask you to focus your attention if you could on this chart here which basically deals with the level of revenues that have been gained from a capital gains tax reduction versus the level of revenues when we have seen an increase in the capital gains tax cuts now i referred a few minutes ago to the capital gains tax cut which was known as the steiger amendment which in 1978 saw a reduction in the capital gains rate from 50 percent down to a 28percent rate that capital gains tax reduction which started then actually did create an increase in revenues to the treasury i refer to the 1981 economic recovery tax act known as the reagan tax cut we saw the rate reduction take place and we saw a further increase in revenues to the federal treasury this has taken place for a wide range of reasons primarily the fact that we have eliminated the socalled lockin effect whereby people who have a tremendous appreciation hold on to it because the rate of taxation is so high when we have a rate reduction they sell off those items which have a capital gains appreciation and therefore those dollars are going back into the economy the tax revenues come into the treasury and the dollars that the individual investors have been able to accrue are reinvested well in the 1986 tax reduction act known as the tra which i happened to oppose there was a 40percent increase in the capital gains tax rate that 40percent increase in the capital gains tax rate created a tremendous disincentive for those who had capital appreciation what happened was we saw a tremendous drop in revenues to the treasury because of that socalled lockin effect which went into play and at that point we lost a tremendous amount of revenue tragically now there are many that say that the loss in revenue to the treasury which has come since 1986 has been because of the economic slowdown which has taken place but you cansee on this chart here that there is a tremendous dropoff which takes place in 1987 when we were still seeing economic growth take place long before the economic recession began this played a role in creating the economic recession that increase in the capital gains tax rate of 40 percent which was incorporated in the 1986 tax reform act actually decreased revenues to the treasury and laid the groundwork for the economic recession which has been so devastating so it seems to me as we look at tax rates especially in the area of capital gains the best thing that we can possibly do is reduce them to stimulate the economy now the joint commission on taxation has come to the conclusion that any capital gains tax rate which is beyond 28 5 percent actually decreases the flow of revenue to the federal treasury as we look at that and this is evidence which has come from a wide range of economists and not just information from economists but empirical evidence which we have gleaned from the activities of investors here in the united states what we found is that we are going to decrease revenue to the treasury if there is any kind of increase in the capital gains tax rates and what we need to do to increase revenue to the treasury is actually see a meaningful cut in the capital gains tax rate this is a bipartisan issue as i said president clinton talked about it in his campaign last fall i wish he had taken that capital gains rate reduction plan that he talked about as a candidate and put it into place as part of his budget package unfortunately he did not and it is not the only promise that he has turned his back on and many of us have recognized that on both sides of the aisle when i say the capital gains tax reduction is not simply a partisan issue it is not just the fact that president clinton talked about it as a candidate we saw here in the house a vote on the capital gains issue two years ago and that vote saw 43 democrats join with us to pass the package tragically the capital gains tax reduction designed to stimulate economic growth died in the senate because of the filibuster that was brought about by the senate majority leader"], [0.0015707067213952541, 0.0015707067213952541, 0, "i rise in support of the words of every republican spoken today and to associate myself with the remarks of a fighting commonsense democrat the gentleman from ohio with all the white house has been doing over the last couple of weeks the american people are justified in asking what in blazes is going on with the clinton administration and specifically what is up with his budget while the concern is real the focus may be a little off indeed many things are going up with the clinton budget we are considering today but the worst things about it are what things are going down i want to bring my colleagues attention to both the ups and the downs of the socalled plan needless to say spending is up despite omb director leon panettas comments earlier this year that the administrations budget would contain 2 in spending for every 1 in new taxes this reconciliation bill reverses this plan it actually contains 6 in taxes and fees for every 1 in spending reductions and it is a 20toi ratio over the first 2 years call me a cynic but that is more in line with what some of us expected indeed whether spending reductions will ever occur is open to question but one thing is clear the president and the majority democrats in congress are interested only in paying lip service to spending cuts in its exhaustive search for domestic programs that dont work and are no longer needed the administration came up with only 11 programs totaling less than 3 billion out of the 1 427 trillion in nondefense outlays in 1997 and of the 343 billion this bill contains in reconciled reductions less than 70 billion is not arrived at by higher taxes overall this budget adds nearly 38 billion in new or expanded entitlement programs which have after all been the problem with this budget all along while the administration has been forced into negotiating with congress over entitlement caps little has been said about the entitlement programs the budget creates even though halt a dozen human resources provisions were cut by 1 2 billion over 5 years incredibly 20 other programs were expanded by 1 9 billion creating a spending increase of 700 million so what did the ways and means committee do characteristically it added new taxes including extending the federal unemployment tax which now enjoys permanent status as a temporary tax only in washington the new immunization program is a good example of how the democrats pass up opportunities to reform social services and simply resort to throwing dollars at problems despite evidence that govemmentprovided immunizations will have no impact on the immunization rate the democrats passed on a republican plan to allow states to use rewards and punishments to encourage welfare recipients to immunize their children thereby adding another 2 billion to cost of this bill there is not even a pretense that the regressive energy tax portion of this tax bill will not be used for more spending the white house has stated that the energy tax will help reduce the deficit and put the government on a payasyougo basis for needed public programs thats more spending folks and itis interesting to see how the democrats have tried to hide the taxs regressivity by robbing one class of taxpayers to pay off another this budget spends at least onehalf of the 71 5 billion expected to be raised over 5 years on lowincome families and individuals including printed on recycled paper containing 100 post consumer waste h 2998 c a 28 billion increase in the earned income tax credit eitc 7 billion in additional food stamp payments and 1 billion for lowincome home energy assistance program payments this forces middleincome familieshardly our nations richest taxpayersto pay an excessive share of the administrations revenue goal and as the energy tax increases yearly it is impossible for the middle class to know the size of the bag it is left holding it truly is a stealth tax which brings me to the next item that is up with the clinton budgettaxes all of this increased spending will require passage of the most massive tax hike in history it calls for 332 billion in tax increases over next 5 years and adding the various hidden increases the tax bite will grow even larger in later years it creates a new individual income tax rate brackets at the 36 and 39 6 percent levels which reach even lower down the income scale than now these new tax rates are supposed to raise 31 billion of the 39 billion in deficit reduction for 1994 under this plan gone at least from this reconciliation bill is all pretense of a millionaire surtax the white house no longer pretends that it is anything more than another rate bracket with millionaires defined now as those earning more than 250 000 and of course this tax is retroactive to the beginning of 1993 even families with incomes under 20 000 contrary to the presidents claims will bear the burden every time they pay their heating bills fill their gas tanks of make a purchase of almost any kind the clinton energy tax alone will cost every american family 471 a year individuals with adjusted gross incomes over 150 000 who pay estimated taxes must under the clinton budget pay 110 percent of current year taxes as next years estimated taxes to qualify for a safe harbor so individuals with no increase in income or tax liability during that year are effectually giving the government an interestfree loan this is outrageous but it is even worse for corporations even though this bill sets the maximum corporate tax rate at 35 percent large corporations which pay estimated taxes must pay a full 100 percent estimation rather than the 97 percent under current law this reduces the margin of error in computing estimated taxes and virtually assures the assessment of penalties the administration hopes to gain 2 7 billion from this unfair illusory deficit reduction provision which will only speed up the payment of corporate taxes by a few months and make a cheap profit from hardtofollow rules which are broken there is a hidden rate bracket increase in this reconciliation bill on small businesses and family farms the biggest job creators throughout the 1980s the bill would phaseout the permanent personal exemption limiting itemized deductions and removing the cap on wages subject to the health insurance tax there is also a new maximum marginal tax rate of nearly 44 percent as my colleagues know the maximum marginal tax rate currently almost 32 percentrepresents the true incentive for entrepreneurs to earn extra money so once a person pays the highest stated tax rate of 39 6 percent adds in a medicare tax for selfemployed individuals of 2 9 percent and tacks on an itemized deduction limit at about 1 2 percent tell me what is the incentive for him or her to engage in the type of

said this morning in more detail i believe there is a real possibility that vince foster committed suicide i do not believe after reading that report in some detail with about seven other people that he committed suicide at fort marcy park i believe his body was moved to that location and i will tell this body why i want to go into my remarks this morning because i do not want to hurt the foster family but at the same time i believe that if there was some misdeeds done out there the american people have a right to know and this congress has a right to know and there should be a complete and full investigation if there are any irregularities let us go into this just a little bit the man that found vince fosters body said his face was straight up and yet if you read the report there was blood coagulated on the side of his face and on the shirt forensics experts say his body was like this and they say in the report that one of the people who worked on the investigation must have moved his head the fact of the matter is before they even got out there the man that found him said his head was straight up so the head had been moved before the experts went out there who moved the body we need to find out who moved the body there was blonde hair not mr fosters on his tshirt and other parts of his garments whose hair was it it was not his there were carpet and other wool fibers found on the body where did they come from i do not like to talk about this but there was semen found on his underwear which would indicate there might have been a sexual experience that afternoon between i and 5 if that is the case it is hard to understand the state of mind of somebodk who is thinking about committing suicide and having a sexual encounter at the same time here is something very damaging they dug 18 inches around the body and they sifted all of the dirt and they could find no skull fragments at the site no skull fragments were found at the site and there was a 3inch hole at the back of the mans head from the gun if he was killed at fort marcy park they would have found skull fragments at that site why were they not found there i believe because he committed suicide or was killed someplace else and moved to that spot all of the bullets that were found at the site using modern technology show that there were a number of bullets found but not the one which killed vince foster and they were out there with grids and everything else for several days with 16 people looking and why was the gun in mr fosters hand in the wrong hand mr foster was lefthanded the gun was in his right hand i want to tell you that if you are going to commit suicide and you are in that state of mind usually you grab with the hand you use all of the time the gun was in the other hand why did the man who found fosters body say there was no gun in either hand not once not twice but three times when he talked to gordon liddy and that is the man the fbi investigated my concern is for the facts and the truth when people say i am down here trying to bring this body to a low ebb i resent it i am concerned about the feelings of the family members and i think it is tragic that they went through this mr foster had an awfully good record in life but if his body was moved we need to know from where it was moved if he had this kind of experience during the day we need to know about it we need to know whose hair was on his body these are questions that need to be answered we need to know why there were no skull fragments at the site if he blew the back of his head out it appears to me that he probably was moved from someplace else while i have time left let me go into what happened after mr foster was killed at 6 on july 20 deputy white house counsel vincent foster was found dead in the park shortly after 9 white house chief of staff mack mclarty was informed of his death mclarty ordered his office sealed however the office remained unlocked overnight until u the next day and despite this order less than 3 hours after his body was found white house officials removed records of business deals between mr clinton and his wife and the whitewater development corp from mr fosters office without telling federal authorities who were investigating the death in fact they did not admit that they were in the office until 6 months later why the people who went in were white house counsel bernie nussbaum the presidents special assistant patsy thomasson and mrs clintons chief of staff maggie williams bernie nussbaum said they were there 10 minutes the park police said they were there over 2 hours taking files out of that office during his first search whitewater files and president clintons tax returns were removed and turned over to david kendall president clintons attorney were any of those destroyed i do not know white house officials did not confirm that the july 20 search took place as i said until late in december there are a lot of questions to be answered we want to take care of peoples feelings especially family members but i something was done wrong we need to get to the bottom of it i include for the record the chronology of the two searches as well as some unanswered questions concerning mr fosters death as follows"], [0.00165898900013417, 0.00165898900013417, 0, "president clinton in his state of the union message talked about his plan to deal with the deficit and the republican study committee which i chair spent the entire weekend studying president clintons budgetary proposals and what kind of an impact it would have either positive or negative on the united states of america here is what we found there were 325 5 billion in tax increases the largest tax increase in unitedstates history by more than 60 or 70 percent the largest before that was around 184 billion in addition to that there are 70 billion in hidden fee and get this they are called spending cuts they have got 70 billion in fees in there that are called spending cuts when that is actually more money coming out of taxpayers pockets when you talk about spending cuts he has been telling america about this there are spending cuts totaling 91 7 billion but there are spending increases totaling 185 9 billi6n for a net increase of 94 2 billion so when he tells you he is going to cut spending the fact of the matter is we are not cutting domestic spending we are increasing it by over 94 billion on top of that there are 395 billion in new taxes and hidden fee increases the only spending cuts in his budgetary propolal that we can find are in the area of defense and those cuts were going to take place anyhow and that is 112 billion so the deficit reduction plan he is talking about is not coming from spending cuts it is coming out of the hides of the american taxpayer now 2 years ago when we had the budget summit agreement and president bush erroneously i believe signed on to that agreement with the democrat majority in both the house and the senate weraised taxes on the backs of the american people to the tune of 182 billion and that tax increase cost us thousands and thousands of jobs and put this country into an economic recession that we are just now coming out of the tax increases president clinton is talking about in my view are going to cost at least 250 000 jobs in the next year to 18 months and it is going to put this country into an economic decline much worse than what we have seen in recent years now i was talking to one of my democrat colleagues today and i promised i would not use his name because he was sorry he said this but he meant it here is what he said with smile any tax you pass is going to put somebody out of business and that is the problem these huge tax increases are going to put a lot of marginal business people over the brink and they are going to go bankrupt today out in the hall just 5 or 10 minutes ago i talked to members from the farm bureau do you know what they told me the btu tax the energy tax which i call the big time unemployment tax the btutax is going to cost them so much that many of them will go out of business because they cannot pass those increased costs on to the consumer because of the way the agricultural markets work on the commodities exchange they cannot pass that on so a lot of small farmers and mediumsized and large farmers are going to go out of business if we pass the btu tax in addition i just had a bunch of people call me who are in the foundry business they rely on energy to make the molds and make the products that most of us in this country use it is one of the biggest industries in america they tell me that many foundries are going to go out of business if we pass this stu tax then we come to the airline industry and i am only going to mention three tonght but i can go on and on and on but the airline industry is going to be hit with a 15 centsper gallon jet fuel increase and many of those airlines if you have been reading in the papers are on the brink of bankruptcy now they are trying to cut deals with british airways and other foreign airlines just to stay above water here we are going to joad on the backs of the airlines one of the most important parts of commerce in this country another 15 cents per gallon fuel tax i guarantee itis going to put alot of them out of business every one of these companies that go out of business has enployees when they go out f business their emplqyees lose their jobs and when they lose their jobs that increases the unemployment rolls for each 1 percent of unemployment when you add in all of the benefits they get that costs the taxpayers and the treasury 342 billion this one little phase of his economic recovery program is a recipe for economic disaster so i am telling my friends across this country who say well we have to do something we have gdt to do something we want to cut that deficit cut the debt that is absolutely true when president clintonstood up here and he said to the american people it is not what is important for me it is what is important for us meaning the entire nation he was absolutely corpect but the solution is not these homongous tax increases which will make us less competitive tith our foreign trading partners will drive business out of this country and itake jobs along with it take money out of the taxpayers pockets withoutwhich they cannot buyproducts and if they donot buy the products they do not produce products and if they do nat produce products people lose their jobs and unemplqyment goesup the solution is to cut government spending ten yearsago we were bringing in 500 billion a year in tax revenues it is now 1 2trillion we have almost tripled the amount of tax revenues coming in in the last 10 years and yet we are still rumling deficits tof about 350 to 400 billion per year so what is the answer the answer s nut more taxes out of your hide america the answer is to cutspending now how do you do that president clinton mhallenged the republicans saying if you are gding to complain be speciffc i have got a plan and you dont well we do mve a 3plan many of us have aplan it is called freezng spending at last years level

is already 400 billion in the red 1 out of the 3 spent by this congress is borrowed money this bill is an insult because under this bill the 4 1 trillion federal debt will get worse much worse the federal debt is so bad that 1 out of every 5 that the american taxpayer sends to washington goes for nothing but interest payments on a national debt and now the democrats in this congress are going

to join me in defeating this monstrosity so we can start over on a real deficit reduction plan that will reduce the deficitone that will cut spending and increase jobs in america a couple weeks ago i sent out a constituent newsletter to the people of the fourth congressional district as you might expect a good part of that newsletter was dedicated to the presidents tax bill and the reasons i felt it was bad for the country and the reasons why i opposed it in the original draft of the newsletter i made a couple lighthearted jabs at the presidents tax bill i mentioned that opposition to the bill was growing as more people learned more about it i said people started realizing that bill clintons economic plan is a lot like his haircutits much more vxpensive than it looks i also mentioned that the presidents btu tax was a technical energy termit stands for bill tricked you neither of those remarks was in the final version of my constituent newsletter they were both censored out by the house franking commission the franking commission would not approve the newsletter until i removed these two remarks they said they were too partisan but if this bill passes today and if you vote for this bill today you will not be able to hide behind smoke or mirrors and you will not be able to censor out the truth the btu tax was dropped in conference that is one of the few good things that did happen there but if you vote for this bill today the term btu still applies bill tricked you this is not what bill clinton promised in the election this is not what the american people voted for last november this is nnt even what bill clinton said it was tuesday night in his oval office fireside chat he is smooth and he is slick and he is a great teleprompter performer but regardless of how convincing the president may be this bill is still taxandspend pure and simple it will not cut the deficit it will not create jobs and it will not cut spending and no matter what you say you are not going to be able to hide the tax increases in this bill from the american zeople come next april 15 we treat criminals better than this bill treats taxpayers at least criminals are protected by the constitution from laws passed ex post facto you cannot make an act a crime retroactively and punish someone for it this bill punishes taxpayers for success after the fact all the way back to its amazing a lot of presidents have raised a lot of taxes but mr clinton is the first one who has managed to raise taxes before he was even sworn into office the clinton tax increases that we are voting on today actually go back and raise peoples taxes on income earned before mr clinton was even president i guess we should consider ourselves fortunate he could have made it retroactive even more and tried to tax the money people made when people were still making moneyduring the reagan years before the 1990 tax increase you can run and you can hide but even death is no protection against mr clintons appetite for new taxes like grave robbers in the night this bill raises the estate taxes on people who had the misfortune of dying since january it rips open the coffin and steals the silver dollars from the eyes of the dearly deceased if that is not punitive taxation i dont know what is i am not touching that grave diggers shovel you can hide behind the presidents assurances that this bill only taxes the rich but what about the jobs it destroys do you really think that small businesses the real job creators in this country are going to be able to expand and aire at the same time they are trying to come up with the money to pay their retroactive tax liability most small businesses partnerships and s corporations are taxed as individual income taxpayers and yes some of them are successful enough to be in the category that mr clinton calls the rich they are the folks who do the hiring and growing and who create 80 percent or more of the new jobs in this country by plowing their profits back into their business but if this tax bill passes small business wont be plowing back much they will be paying up new jobsdo not count on it the president is definitely right about one thing the people who do not get those new jobs which are not created because of his tax bill they definitely will not be paying higher taxes they will be unemployed retroactive taxation is not the only inequity here look at the taxes on senior citizens they are not richat least most of them six million social security households are going to be hit with the largest tax increase in the entire bill by having 85 percent of their social security benefits taxed rather than 50 percent the number will go up to 8 million by 1998 and higher every year after as inflation pushes more and more social security recipients over the threshold some 40 000 households in kentucky will be paying 32 million more in taxes because of this one provision and we arent talking about people with incomes over that magic 180 000 level that the president keeps using 57 percent of the taxes generated by the elderly surcharge will come from seniors with incomes under 75 000 even if you hold your nose long enough to get past the punitive retroactive tax increases and elderly surcharges in the bill you are left with one simple factthis bill just will not work it will not reduce the deficit tax increases wont reduce the federal deficit congress has proven this over and over again every time this body raises taxes it just turns around and raises spendings gimmicks like the presidents deficit reduction trust fund will not change that reality the promised spending cuts will not materialize and i have never seen a single economic model which even begins to suggest that you can create prosperity with tax increases it just cannot be done i ask you all to listen to the people for a minute they are sayingand they have been sayingcut spending first this bill does not do that it doesnt cut spending today it raises taxes yesterday it raises taxes today it raises taxes tomorrow but when it comes to spending cuts it only promises it only promises cuts some place down the road at some far off tomorrowa tomorrow that probably will never come we have heard those promises before we heard them in 1990 the taxes are still here but the promised budget cuts never came when i say there are no budget cuts in the bill i am of course speaking in relative terms there are some budget cutsthey are few and far betweenbut even these are phoney and temporary the presidents bill takes a token slap at federal employees cutting manning levels and freezing pay it slashes defense and it cuts reimbursements to doctors and hospitals but the only realistic way to cut federal employment costs over the long run is to improve efficiency or to cut the size of the federal government and to eliminate unnecessary programs as long as the federal government keeps growing we are going to need good qualified people to run those programs temporary employee cutbacks and pay freezes wont do the job but the presidents program doesnt cut back the growth of the government and it doesnt eliminate a single federal program the president does propose slashing defense spending in fact he plans to decimate national defense by cutting 127 billion but is that realistic i dont think so if he tries to cut that much some place along the line he is going to discover he doesnt even have enough aircraft carriers left for photo opportunities if he cuts as much as he proposes from national defense mr clinton is even going to have to ask mike dukakis to return the tank he used in the 1988 campaign and of course i think everybodyif they tell the truthrealizes we cant keep cutting the reimbursement for doctors and hospitals without destroying the quality of health care the savings arent real anyway the costs are just shifted out of the governments budget into the private sector so even the few cuts that are included in the presidents plan are phoney or temporary at best so overall the presidents plan was not improved very much in the conference process it is still a taxandspend bill the cuts are few what cuts there are are phoney and the taxes are very realretroactivejob killers the president would have us believe that he is our nations savior with a plan to heal the sick and raise the dead instead his proposal would sicken the economy and tax the dead it didnt have to be this way the republicans worked hard to come up with a realistic budget alternative that proposed real cuts in real programs but our proposal was frozen out early on the majority never gave it a chance or a second thought maybe if we defeat this bill we could get together and work out a real deficit reduction plan thats what we need to do this bill is not going to do the job you will not be able to hide behind empty promises backroom deals and censorship if this bill is enacted when april 15 comes around people are going to

strong support of campaign finance reform but in even stronger opposition to h r 3 coming from what is perhaps the least partisan state in the nation by orientation i find the excessive partisanship of the congress to be appalling coming from a good government state i find the currently evolved campaign finance system has a corrosive affect on the congress ability to routinely act to serve the public interest and our national interest america needs campaign finance reform but during the previous 102d congress the campaign finance reform bill was constructed primarily to generate partisan advantages and the truth is that there was certainly no legitimate effort by the house and senate majority leadership to work in a bipartisan way to achieve real and very necessary reform a partisan bill was forced from the congress which was intended to invoke a bush veto in the current 103d congress the democrat leadership once again is proceeding under the business as usual theory and refusing to listen to the american people who are demanding workable bipartisan campaign finance reform and one which does not include public financing of congressional campaigns we do need to address the problem of incumbent advantages and we do need to establish spending limits however this is the fourth time in the last 3 years that a campaign finance reform bill was constructed to primarily generate partisan advantages there was once again no legitimate effort by the house democrat leadership to work in a bipartisan way to achieve real and very necessary reform this member is disappointed with the democrat tactics and with h r 3 to say the least while h r 3 includes some positive features it has numerous major problems foremost among its problems is the provision providing almost irrelevantly high spending limits certainly too high to be a limiting factor in the great majority of congressional races or districts in short the measure sets the spending limit for house races too high at 600 000 even though the average cost of winning a house seat was 410 000 in 1990 and in 1992 only a third of current house members spent more than 600 000 to win their seats under h r 3 however no campaign would ever be subject to the socalled 600 000 spending limit once exemptions and inflation are factored in the spending cap will be closer to 1 million for most house races by the time it takes effect for the 1996 election this is a political ploy designed to make spending limits so high as to be meaningless in most districts of course the legislation should still be made to be totally effective in 1994not 1996 another problem is the partial public financing provided in h r 3 which is estimated to cost taxpayers 1 billion over the next decade while the supporters of h r 3 argue that the vouchers provided in this measure are not public financing the american public knows that their tax dollars will be used to pay for these food stamps for politicians public financing would be seen as just one more advantage incumbents are giving themselves most americans do not want the taxpayer or government to finance congressional elections they do not want to fund what will surely be called welfare politicians polling in nebraska and national polling shows that more than 70 percent of the people strongly oppose public financing of elections however this member notes that on june 17 1993 the senate passed its version of campaign finance reform which included a compromise limiting proposed public financing of congressional campaigns to candidates whose opponents exceed voluntary spending limits while this member remains opposed to comprehensive public financing for congressional races this member believes that the senate compromise is a good effort to find a workable way to reduce some of the major defects in the current campaign finance system it is therefore only folly and a purely partisan step to pass h r 3 with its overreaching version of public financing furthermore h r 3 does not include a way to pay for its benefits in fact the measure will not have any effect at all unless the financing legislation is passed later the democrat leadership was only able to overcome the financing stumbling block to its legislation by completely severing from the bill the funding mechanism the funding part of the measure would have had to pass through the house ways and means committee where apparently there were grave concerns about proposed new taxes on candidate contributions and a new larger proposed tax checkoff to fund the system therefore the house is now considering only half of the legislation and not the entire democratsponsored campaign reform bill we will only get to consider the additional unspecified funding next year this twobill plan is a ridiculous and an issuecowardly way for the house to do business this is one member who ts not afraid to say that this is a bad bill with completely flawed and unworkable sections the measures ban on bundling exempts pacs that are not connected to a business or labor group this is merely an obvious and totally unjustified attempt to create a special exemption for pacs like emilys list and wish list this provision practically guarantees that every pac in the country will reorganize in order to avoid the already too high limits on pac contributions furthermore the bills socalled ban on soft money money that is not subject to federal guidelines creates numerous loopholes that subvert the intent of any real soft money reform instead of an outright ban on soft money h r 3 provides a myriad of exceptions for example federal candidates are prohibited from raising soft money for party committees but they could raise soft money for state candidates in this members opinion you either ban soft money completely or you do notebut you do not create so many exceptions as to make a socalled ban meaningless additionally in reality there is no effective limit on special interest contributions from pacs the bills pac limit is insignificant in that it would affect only those receiving more than 200 000 from pacs this member has called for the elimination of pac contributions or at least the sharp reduction in the individual pac contributions limit to 1 000 a real reduction in pac contributions is needed to help challengers become more competitive since statistics from the last election indicated that 71 percent of pac funds went to incumbents it simply will be business as usual under the pac provisions of h r 3at the same time the public is complaining or at least widely suspicious about the undue influence of pacs in light of the real need for campaign finance reform on february 2 1993 this member reintroduced his campaign finane reform package while this members omnibus bill does not represent comprehensive campaign finance reform it certainly represents changes that must be included in any comprehensive campaign reform bill that congress passes during the 103d congress this member has long been a supporter of campaign finance reform and believes that it is a crucial reform of our political system which is long overdue the voters have nationally called rather loudly for change therefore this members campaign finance reform legislation would first reduce the pac contribution limit to 1 000 per pac second prohibit bundling of contributions through connected pacs third prohibit transfers among pacs and candidate committees fourth leadership pacs fifth prohibit soft money use to benefit federal candidates in joint federalstate activities sixth require a majority of funds raised by house candidates to come from local residents seventh prohibit corporations and unions from using their own money to indirectly influence federal elections eighth require a clearer disclaimer on independent expenditure communications and ninth require unions to get written approvalof any members whose dues or agency fees are used for political purpoems and require annual notice to such members if such funds are used for political purpose in addition this member is an original cosponsor of h r 3470 the house republican campaign finance reform package which this member will support today when the michel alternative to h mr 3 is offered this package has received favorable coverage from the media roll call called this plan tough and ambitious the christian science monitor reported that the republican proposals to ban all pacs and require local fundraising have wide public support indeed this reform package would improve competition reduce special interest influence increase disclosure and return power back to indistrict individuals the house republican package provides real reform without public financing or unconstitutional spending limits or taxes our comprehensive reform proposal will first ban all pacs if a ban on nonconnected pacs is determined to be unconstitutional the allowable nonconnected pac contribution would be reduced to 1 000 second ban the use of soft money to influence federal elections third ban bundling by pacs and lobbyists fourth require that a majority of a candidates funds be raised from indistrict individuals fifth allow political parties to contribute matching payments to challengers up to the amount of the war chest carried over by an incumbent sixth drop the contribution limits to a candidate whose opponent spends more than 250 000 in personal funds seventh implement the beck decision to require unions to get written approval of any members whose dues or agency fees are used for political purposes and require annual notice to union members if such funds are used for political purpose eighth increase the contribution limit to state parties to 20 000 the same level currently allowed for contributions to national parties ninth require disclosure of spending by unions corporations and nonprofits on political activities undertaken to influence federal elections tenth require that reform apply to the 1994 elections however the bill before us today h r 3 is designed to ensure partisan advantages by giving overwhelming advantages to incumbents

intelligence budget is cloaked and two the abrupt change in direction that the intelligence conferees have taken in their report regarding two important intelligence programs first i will state to my colleagues once again my belief that the foreign policy activities of this nation taken by our government on behalf of its citizens should and is for the most part done in the open i believe it is wrong however that an arm of our government is given the authority to conduct operations other than intelligence gathering in support of foreign policy goals that are unknown to our citizens the people of the united states have a right to be engaged in the debate which yields our foreign policy activities i do not here refer to the important maintenance of operational secrecy but rather to the need to debate in the open whether and when we would engage in hostile operations against another country in this context my concern lies not specifically the overall budget level for intelligence although i believe that prudent savings in the intelligence budget can be realized with careful planning and a recognition of the many new and open ways in which information flows to policymakers additionally it is the right of the people of our country to know the funding level of its intelligence agencies i will continue to support legislative efforts that would bring these aspects into the sunshine my second objection to the report is concemed more with what has become ablurred relationship between the national foreign intelligence or nfip programs and tactical intelligence and related activities or tiara programs i think it is time we substantially change this arrangement i am disappointed and concerned that the conferees have increased the authorization for nfip above the budget request while authorizing a corresponding decrease in tiara programs this action is contrary to actions taken by the conferees on the fiscal year 1995 defense authorization and appropriations acts and contrary to agreements reached between the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence resulting from their joint review of nfip and tiara programs we should be focusing on the interoperability of capabilities in support of military operations ensuring essential improvements for imagery support as well as developing a new unitedstates intelligence program and budget structure to better reflect user needs and priorities consistent with our changed strategic environment the blurring of national versus tactical intelligence was highlighted last year when the committee raised concern in its report on the fiscal year 1994 defense authorization bill the committee then observed that over the years the boundaries between tiara and nfip components of the intelligence budgets have become a source of confusion and contention the committee was and continues to be concerned that the lack of clearly established definitions for nfip and tiara have led to the sometimes arbitrary assignment of intelligence programs and functions within these categories as a consequence the armed services committee called on the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence to review intelligence programs and activities and provide to congress a report identifying those programs which support first primarily national purposes second primarily defensewide theater activities and the unified command or three primarily a single service or agency the report was also to have identified those programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget although we have seen fragments and or bits and pieces of what appears to be a concerted effort to address this matter a formal comprehensive report has yet to be provided an important review was undertaken by the department earlier this year to determine what if any programs or activities should be removed from tiara this effort was undertaken in response to the fiscal year 1994 house armed services committee language asking the department to identify programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget as a result the department determined that indeed there were certain programs that fell outside the definition of tiara used by the congress and has subsequently proposed to delete these activities from the fiscal year 1996 tiara congressional justification book these programs include for example ballistic missile defense the defense meteorological support program tanker support to reconnaissance and the navys mapping charting and geodesy to name a few when added up funding for these programs totaled more than a half a billion dollars in each of fiscal year 1994 and further earlier this year nowdeputy secretary of defense john deutch notified officials within the department of defense and congress that effective june 1 1994 he was establishing the joint military intelligence program or jmip to focus on joint defensewide initiatives activities and programs that predominantly provide intelligence information and support to multiple defense customers the goal of the jmip is to bridge existing programmatic divisions across national and service or departmental intelligence lines to provide more effective and coherent intelligence programmatic decisionmaking and ultimately to provide support to military intelligence consumers policymakers force modernization planners and warfighters i concur with the administration in their intent to submit a joint military intelligence program budget re

a sham and are likely to never occur many are doubledcounted from other bills user fees shamelessly labeled as tax cuts or spending cuts that begin in the out years since 80 percent of the cuts occur after the 1996 election one must wonder whether a future congress will still approve these cuts the taxes however are retroactive and are here to stay the 5year ratio of taxes to spending cuts is 2 13 of taxes for every 1 in cuts the package also falls to terminate even one single program the clinton tax increases will undoubtedly cost our economy jobs the economic forecasts are chilling dri mcgraw

tax designed to tax the rich falled miserably instead of raising revenues by hitting the wealthy yacht buyers the tax destroyed the jobs of the middleclass americans who built yachts i knew that this type of class warfare would fall and i voted against it in 1990 we should take a lesson from the luxury tax experience and abandon this new call for class warfare the presidents historic tax increase

certain standards in content and curricula and standards in performance everything has been voluntary everything has been in terms of we will state certain models and the states in the final analysis will decide what they want to do local control in curriculum has not been violated in any of the legislation for education that we have pursued so far if there are people who really want to have the federal government have a greater role in promoting values and preventing teenage pregnancies and providing more positive sex education then there are many things the federal government can do madam chairman let us be brave enough to take on the media be brave enough to use the power of the federal government through the federal communications commission the no i problem in america with respect

promote more stringent requirements on the manner in which sex and the wanton participation in sex is encouraged via our media via the radio television and motion picture formats we have the power to regulate interstate commerce the movement of pornographic magazines there are a number of things we can do corporations are responsible for most of the progranming that appears on broadcast television and much of the programming that appears on cable television we have power with respect to the regulation of corporate activity we have power with respect to regulation of how they spend their advertising dollars if you want to be brave and do something about trying to influence teenage values then why not take on a greater regulation role with respect to the fcc with respect to corporate power and the kinds of things they finance why not take on a greater regulation role with respect to the motion picture industry the magazine industry there are a number of ways in which you can deal with and deal more effectively with your agenda to better promote more positive attitudes among teenagers with respect to sex educatiom we have no business in interfering and we hope that they will take the necessary steps to provide enough sex education to guarantee that the youngsters know how to protect their own health to guarantee they know how to survive madam chairman aids is a very

many times more times than i can count it sets history on its head it takes me aback it is shocking to me to hear tonight on the floor of this body that the gentleman is asking us to oppose a rule that does not waive all points of order we cannot walk both sides of the street simultaneously unless your legs are pretty wide open and when they are you stand pretty vulnerable the gentleman from new york is my good friend and i respect him he says one person can rise to raise a point of order i do not stand here in the capacity of one person this is not an ego trip this is no personal issue i stand here as the chairperson of the authorizing committee charged with a responsibility it sets history on its head when you argue to sanction violations of a process that the gentleman from new york and i have already marched into the well on numerous occasions to defend that the integrity of the process must be maintained let us come specifically to the carrier let me say something to my colleague we asked for a point of order to be allowed against a 1 billion appropriation against a 4 8 billion weapons system now that is not an accommodation that is real money the bill says appropriation based on authorization first to simply say that is a prima facie case that that is a weapons system that is not authorized second i would say to the gentleman from new york this weapons system was not even requested in fiscal year now to the integrity of the process if authorized the house authorization bill did not authorize it it does not appear anywhere in the companion report of the fiscal year 1994 authorization bill just passed by the house further in the other body the companion bill of the dod authorization for fiscal year 1994 also did not authorize this weapons system their report does not speak to it to the gentleman from new york i would ask this question that he might answer in his time if the bill says appropriate upon authorization and the house authorization bill did not authorize it the senate authorization bill did not authorize it the only way that it can be authorized in fiscal year 1994 is both bodies to report back in a conference report s1 billion out of scope where is the precedent for coming back to a body 1 billion out of scope i would suggest that logic stands on this gentlemans side if you can authorize the bill in fiscal year 1994 and you say you cannot appropriate until you authorize and you cannot authorize until fiscal year 1995 then query why then encumber 31 billion in budget authority to appropriate in fiscal year 1994 saying that it is sitting there waiting so some businessman says well if i can take this money from 1994 sit it there until we authorize on october 1 we can rush to start signing contracts we on the house armed services committee take our jobs very seriously i will say to the gentleman from new york if we have rules here how can we argue to vote down a rule because it waives points of order we ought to maintain the integrity of the authorizing process but then when it comes to defense we say but let us set that aside do you want a kangaroo court here do you want rules that govern different subject matters in different ways then this would be a bizarre experience there has to be some continuity this would be a bizarre experience so there has to be some way you can say yes in the authorizing process you can say no in the appropriation process but you cannot turn that around you cannot say no authorization and yes in the appropriation that is the rules that were set up before i came here
