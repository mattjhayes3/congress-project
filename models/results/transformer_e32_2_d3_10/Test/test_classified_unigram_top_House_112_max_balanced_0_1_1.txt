individuals i have heard my republican colleagues mention cost throughout this day well make no mistake there would also be a cost in leaving tens of millions of americans uninsured according to a recent study published by the american journal of public health uninsured working age americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts the study estimates that lack of health insurance causes over 44 000 excess deaths annually that works out to about one death every 12 minutes from lack of health insurance my colleagues let us not forget to count those lives as a very real and continuing cost over 44 000 deaths a year one every 12 minutes i urge my colleagues to support the democratic plan lifesaving legislation and vote against the republican repeal of health care it is wrong for america i urge a no vote i rise in strong opposition to this harmful illconceived bill when the republican majority said it was going to make the deficit their defining issue this congress most of us did not realize it was to make the deficit bigger but according to the congressional budget office their first act to repeal health care would do just thatadd 230 billion to the deficit while making americans pay more for health care instead of focusing on job creation republicans are running up our deficit jeopardizing the health of millions of americans and threatening the creation of new jobs under the republican repeal effort insurance companies will once again be able to drop people when they get sickexactly when coverage is needed most children with preexisting conditions will be denied coverage while insurance companies would again impose devastating annual and lifetime caps young people will not be able to stay on their parents plans until age 26 pregnant women and breast cancer survivors can be denied coverage seniors will face an increase in their prescription drug costsmillions thrown back into the medicare part d donut hole repeal would deny seniors a 50 percent discount on prescription drugs recreating the devastating coverage gap each of these things will disappear if republicans are able to repeal the historic health reform law in my home state of new york repealing the affordable care act would be devastating new york residents providers small businesses and other employers would be denied critical new benefits of the law from protections against insurance industry abuses to new coverage options and millions of dollars in support so states like new york can deliver quality affordable health care options to all of its residents without the affordable care act new york will suffer 77 800 young adults would lose their insurance coverage through their parents health plans sometimes just after they finish school and as they are looking for a job families across new york would lose the peace of mind the affordable care act provides by making sure that young adults can stay on their parents plan to age 26 if they do not have coverage of their own more than 10 million residents of new york with private insurance coverage would suddenly find themselves vulnerable again to having lifetime limits placed on how much insurance companies will spend on their health care insurance companies would once again be allowed to cut off someones coverage unexpectedly when they are in an accident or become sick because of a simple mistake on an application this would leave 734 000 people in new york at risk of losing their insurance at the moment they need it most as one of the worst abuses of the insurance industry would become legal again new insurance plans would no longer be required to cover recommended preventive services like mammograms and flu shots without cost sharing nor would they have to guarantee enrollees the right to choose any available primary care provider in the network or see an obgyn without a referral nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would be forced to pay a copay to receive important preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup visit so nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would have to pay extra if they want to stay healthy by getting checkups regularly 192 596 on medicare would see significantly higher prescription drug costs in new york 192 596 medicare beneficiaries received a onetime taxfree 250 rebate to help pay for prescription drugs in the donut hole coverage gap in 2010 medicare beneficiaries who fall into the donut hole in 2011 will be eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand name prescription drugs without the law the burden of high prescription drug costs would hurt millions of medicare beneficiaries across the country for the sake of argument if we remove the moral obligation of providing health care to 32 million americans who would lose coverage with this repeal we are still left with a compelling fiscal reason for opposing the repeal of this law repeal adds 230 billion to the deficit over the first 10 years and more than 1 2 trillion in the second decade around onehalf percent of gdp americans purchasing health insurance on their own will see their costs rise americans will get fewer health benefits for their money i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill that will balloon the deficit

in this chamber there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the affordable care act when we know fully that the chances are slim to move forward and the measure would not be signed into law is it political posturing i believe it is of a grand style theres a pattern being established here theres been an attackoutright attackon social security attempts to privatize the system its been under attack for the last 76 years its been the underpinning that provides stability for working families across this great nation it has been a security piece that has enabled many to have at least assurances that there would be some support in family budgets as they move month to month we know that that measure social security has been dealing with its enemies for a long timesince before it was made a law likewise medicare which came to us in the midsixties enabled our senior community to have its health care needs met provided predictability and stability for retired households enabled people to enjoy a quality of life a better quality of health care we know that before medicare many of those who had retired expected to see their economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing health care when they perhaps could not get that coverage in an insurance context so medicare as we know it today would be undone by the republican majority in this house they would prefer to privatize social security allow us to reach to the financial sector to perhaps see a repeat of what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this past recession where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away trillions lost in the american economy pain and suffering endured by families across this land theyd rather see a voucher system for medicare handing it over to the insurance companies to leave seniors digging deeper into their pockets so the pattern has been established here and now a repeal of the affordable care act before its full implementation before given a chance as we arrive as the last industrialized nation in the world to provide a universal health care coverage program unacceptable progress is struck a decision is rendered by the highest court in the land a conservativeleaning court before the ink is dry on that decision a move to repeal the court spoke it has spoken to america and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a decision rendered that said yes in fact it meets the constitutionality test and so this evening on the eve of the attempts to repeal the affordable care act as it stands is a very telling moment it is one that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo programs that serve our middle class so very well and without a thriving middle class our nation is not prosperous without that thriving middle class theres not purchasing power strong enough to provide the recovery of our economy without a strengthening of our middle class there is not a confidence in the economy a confidence that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base and so the affordable care act is offering promise and hope to millions tens of millions of americans across this land whether youre insured underinsured uninsured all categories will see strengthening because of this measure think of it i represent a large proportion of senior citizens who are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs many dealing with that doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig into their pockets we close that doughnut hole we make more affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well and in some cases to have the medications that keep them alive we deny that opportunity to our nations seniors we deny the respect that we offer we deny the dignity in the equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals that our senior community requires that doughnut hole would have been closed by 2020 further at the other end of the age spectrum many young adults finding it difficult in this recessionand now the recovery periodto gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college are given the opportunity with the affordable care act to remain on their familys policy until the age of 26 therein lies a strong benefit for some 6 6 million young adults denied with the repeal measure denying access and affordability to health care situations how many cases of young adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction that would not forego this opportunity for our nations young adults a strong benefit associated with this package what about those who have a preexisting condition some 17 million children in that category and thats not to account for the many adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions asthma in children diabetes in our senior community being a woman utilized as a preexisting condition an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic core need that we should consider to be truly american another benefit lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in this house and the united states senate and signed into law by this president what about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding time in their lives games played with people and their lives and their recovery hope pulled from working families across this nation because of an insensitivity of this congress a deplorable situation assistance to our small business community now if we profess our small business community to be the economic engine that is part and parcel of our economic comeback our economic springboard then would we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area would we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business community many a majority of those businesses will remind all of us as representatives that they want to provide for their employees they want a productive workforce that means a strong and well workforce and so they see it as a strong investment one however that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating costs 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker coverage they wanted that turned around they wanted a smart approach a businesslike approach a sensitive response they got it with the affordable care act progress denied the small business engine weakened by this sort of neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing social security privatizing social security changing medicare as we know it forever now repealing the affordable care act we see the pattern we see the gross neglect the disrespect for americas middle class her working families so we go forward and we understand that with the opportunities of an exchange small employers our small business community understands that if theyre unable to enter into an exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the rules to sharpen their pencils roll up their sleeves provide the service live within the parameters and allow for the many to enter into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits think of it if 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be impacted with catastrophic illness its devastating an actuarial impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ if those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange a better outcome a different outcome a stronger outcome for the economic recovery of this nation because the gross majority of jobs being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business community and so you know the formula is quite obvious we want a comeback we want that strongest response here from washington for that kick that we endured from a recession that drained us of 8 2 million jobs the best way to do it first of three principles small business provide for the strengthening of small business which the affordable care act does because that small business community has forever been the pulse of american enterprise secondly invest in that entrepreneur the dreamer the mover the shaker it always stretched us since our days of pioneer spirit with the industrial revolution and the westward movement very familiar to the district i represent which is the donor area to the erie canal in upstate new york in the capital region mohawk valley that pioneer spirit exists in our fabric today its our dna invest in the entrepreneur to be the ideas economy kingpin we rely on these wizards to build us sustain us stretch us empower us and then finally invest in a thriving middle class which the affordable care act does it enables us as a middle class community to be bolstered by the confidence the security the stability that has come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and not just deal with illness that will put together efforts to cost contain that will bring people into a structured program so that we can monitor their activities and connect them to a system you know youll hear from some on the floor we dont want to pay for this its going to cost us too much were paying today for the neglect for the consequences of a notsoperfect system status quo will not cut it and so we need to go forward with progressive policies with the soundness of reform with the boldness of transition with the confidence we can instill with the progressiveness of policies that we can draft and so it is a sad note here echoed in this chamber that would attempt to unravel dilute destroy deny the promise we can make to america as i look at this effort for a comeback the containment of health care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control create that better environment in which to grow jobs cultivate a prosperity its important its important for us to understand that it is part of an economic recovery equation but theres also the wisdom of investing in education in higher education again under attack by a system that does not always profess the strength of research and education and patents and discovery we understand that we are in the midst of a global race on innovation clean energy and ideas and high tech to be outstanding competitors to arrive at that race ready to conquer we will need to be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global scene we saw that order of passion we saw that order of investment in the global race on space just decades ago this nation impacted by a sputnik moment dusted off its backside and said never again never again and what was the result together a nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race on space we are going to be that agent that nation that proud people that would stake the american flag on the moon and we won that race because of a commitment because of investment in the soundness of the people of this great country and her business community we embraced research we embraced science we believed in our strength as a people and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the victory where is that like passion today where is that leadership a rather youthful president that led us in the sixties and challenged us in almost replication today finds us interestingly to be challenged by a rather youthful president asking us to enter into the global sweepstakes committing with passion to the cause and so we need that investment in education in higher education and research just today in schenectady new york in the 21st congressional district of new york that im proud to represent we announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing center at that facility of ge ceo jeff immelt traveled for the celebration came to town to announce this wonderful wonderful addition that is america at work with her genius activity thats america determined to win the global race on ideas advanced battery manufacturing the battery the linchpin to so much potential out there to grow domestic supplies of energy to grow jobs as we grow our energy future to reduce the gluttonous dependency on fossilbased fuels oftentimes imported from some of the most unfriendly nations to the united states sending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the battlefield unacceptable there is a better way and this congress knows it we invest in jobs we invest in health care we invest in education we invest in research we do it in a way that promises our best attempt as a nation to generations yet unborn someone was there for us and we need to be there for future generations of americans to provide the sort of cuttingedge opportunity that will spell america at her best i look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but nanotechnology and semiconductor signs chip manufacturing the newly designed 20th congressional district in new york that comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st district that i represent is probably one of the most technology investedin congressional districts in the country it is happening because there is this belief in the worker a belief in the entrepreneur a belief in the small business community a belief in the industrial context of the district and knowing full well that americas needsbe they for the environment or energys sake or business creation job creation business opportunityare inspiring this remarkable progress it requires our moving forward with a plan it requires our moving forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends i see it all the time i see it in energyefficiency programs that produce jobs that enable us to capture waste heat that is part of the energy process enabling us to be much more efficient efforts that enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown much more competitive much more sophisticated we can ill afford to weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international economy the old american spirit the history of this nation replete with those rags to riches scenarios that became the reason and the inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to these shores because the opportunity called the american dream became the prize for which they searched i see it in my own roots the proudest label i carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants their journey gave me great opportunity and it gave my family great opportunity those journeys chased after the american dream we need beginning in this house chamber to reignite the american dream to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people to reach into that american heart and soul that has forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have opportunity and that we will not deny that opportunity that we will strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a generation of americans let us not fail in that attempt let us continue to reach deep into that american spirit at a time when we were challenged and our economy was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources and when we tripped and fell let it be known that in the recovery we were stronger than ever before because of that belief that our best days lay ahead of us the belief that those best days were in the future we moved forward and we dug deep into that american spirit to respond with the respect for americas middle class our middle classall of us in that middle classhave always understood if you play hard if you abide by the rules if you roll up your sleeves and do your best you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success that is america in her most shining moments and that is an economy that we can produce it begins with the soundness of a strong and productive workforce that went through training and retraining that got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that comes with education and to then understand our gifts so that we could share them in the most profound way and then to provide for the wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive so that the conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to a nation that was humbled by its own beginnings where the rightful stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a nation that believed in her people so tonight on this eve of an attempt to repeal the affordable care act let us understand that our budget here in washington our actions with legislation our responsiveness to the needs of the american people are an establishment of our prioritiesa prescription of what we see our future to bea reaching into the heart to say that we are a truly caring lot thats what separates us from other nations it is the uniqueness of america and her greatness the affordable care act is a measurement of not only sound policy it is a statement of a compassionate society that understands its not about oneself that its about neighbors that its about community that its about the great society it has been the history through the decades through the vintages of time that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation to respond to the challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger we owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn let them look at this moment in history american history knowing that america was challenged that she stepped up to the plate and said yes to her people and truly made a difference and allowed people to understand full well that the best days of this great nation lie ahead of us with that i

too many americans the recession is actually a depression yesterday the out of poverty caucus held a press conference with organizations working on the front lines with lowincome and poor people we heard stories of more homelessness long lines at food pantries and the desperation felt by so many our nations unemployment rate remains at an unacceptably high 9 2 percent millions of americans who have lost their jobs are finding it harder and harder to find a new one these new ranks of the longterm unemployed and their families are facing the stark reality of life in poverty for the first time

trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor is morally wrong we need a balanced approach that balances targeted cuts with the revenue that we need we must make sure that we can pay the benefits that we owe to our seniors protect medicare medicaid and social security and safeguard our most vulnerable communities while the nations unemployment level remains unacceptably high for some

many of us have known for a long long time now african americans and latinos have lost 18 to 20 times their net worth more so than white americans due to structural inequalities where race is a factor

lifeline for older americans providing quality and affordable health care for all seniors but this week house republicans are proposing to strip seniors of this guaranteed benefit the republican budget proposal dismantles medicare as we know it telling seniors they are going to be on their own to find insurance no matter what the cost or how sick they are and it slashes medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists for services or have no access to care at all in pennsylvania my home state nearly 40 percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans had the opportunity to reduce costs while maintaining and strengthening care for our seniors they demonized the plan voting time and again to stop important improvements in medicare and they still want to repeal the law that eliminates copayments for preventive care services that makes prescription drug benefits more affordable and improves coordination of care and health outcomes reduces errors and reduces costs for seniors they want to repeal the law that curbs the growth in medicare spending saves taxpayers almost 500 billion by ending overpayments to insurance companies and extends the life of the medicare

medicare and medicaid for millions of seniors republicans make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans in the very same budget proposal where republicans take away guaranteed

dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires

work but far too many will be suddenly cut off with nearly nothing nothing to keep them from falling behind into poverty they will have been left out and left behind we may disagree on how to help families in need and workers who are struggling find work access needed health services or feed their children but we can all agree that leaving struggling families completely cut off of unemployment insurance with nowhere to turn for help is not the american way when republican politicians protect tax cuts for millionaires we must be very adamant about protecting the working poor when tea party republicans fight to protect tax writeoffs for corporations and big oil we must fight to protect hardworking americans when republican tea party members continued to expend their energy protecting the dividend gains on investments we must fight to protect linda lee and geraldine matthew women who have worked their entire lives and are left with nothing to show for it unfortunately there are some who continue to support policies for the 1 percent where profits rather than people matter we need a jobs bill for those who are desperately in need of a job and we need to help with their support for themselves and their families so we do need a strong safety net to act as a bridge over these troubled economic times its critical to reaffirm that the needs and the aspirations of the poor and the working poor are really important and critical for us to address where they too are aspiring to be part of the middle class i want to thank congresswoman jackson lee for her support because i know she

today in january of 2009 we were losing 775 000 jobs a month then the obama administration and the democratic congress enacted remedial legislation and we stopped losing 775 000 jobs a month we started gaining we have gained a million and a half jobs in the private sector in the last year and a half not enough with a million and a half jobs but unfortunately state and local government had to lay off 1 2 million people because we didnt give them enough to prevent that but we did reverse the results of the bush policy of 8 years which was 775 000 jobs a month being lost dont forget in 2000 in the presidential election the great debate was what should we do about the 5 6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years bush got elected they enacted the bush tax cuts which they said would stimulate the economy and pay for themselves what happened we had the slowest economic recovery of any economic recovery after any recession in the history of the united states the only 8year period in which we did not gain one net new job even before the 2008 recession from which we are now recovering albeit too slowly the american people did not vote to kill remedial programs last year they voted for jobs they were told vote for the republicans well get you jobs you dont see any jobs so lets forget this revisionist history i rise in strong opposition to the republican effort to cut funding for the special supplemental nutritional program for women infants and children known as wic this program provides food for low and moderateincome mothers babies and children under 5 wic provides the food pregnant women need to help their babies grow after the baby is born wic provides the breast feeding support or infant formula to make sure the babies continue to develop and to grow and for young children wic provides staples like milk eggs bread fresh fruits and vegetables nearly 50 percent of the babies born in the united states each year rely on wic to get a healthy start to life but in this time of rampant unemployment the republicans opposethey oppose extended unemployment benefits and now want to ensure that the wives and children of the unemployed who dont get unemployment benefits cant get food and baby formula this bill says let them starve this bill will mean that 200 000 to 350 000 pregnant women and children will be denied food knocking these families out of the wic program is an aboutface on a 15year bipartisan commitment to ensure wic funds cover all eligible women infants and children who apply shockingly at the same time that the republicans are demanding that pregnant women and children starve they continue to promote tax holidays for millionaires and billionaires if we suspended the bush tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of americans for just 1 week we could cover the cost of the republicans latest cut of 833 million to the wic program the debate over wic funding specifically and the federal budget generally is about priorities by supporting the republican proposal to slash wic funding forcing thousands of women and children from the rolls the republicans are saying that america prioritizes tax holidays for those who need it the least over providing food to pregnant women infants and small children mr chair make no mistake about it this is about literally taking food out of the mouths of babies this republican bill is immoral food for women and children is more important than tax cuts for millionaires billionaires and oil companies reject this bill reject this bill and maybe just maybe the republicans given

resolution for a variety of reasons including because it will destroy hundreds of thousands of american transportation jobsjobs lost in every stateand will severely jeopardize our nations economic competitiveness this budget slashes investments in our peoplefrom ending medicare as we know it to destroying the familywage jobs of highway constructionall the while providing a doubledigit percentage tax break for millionaires that most of them will not even notice it makes big oil smile from ear to ear knowing that they can exploit 40 billion in tax loopholes yet the budget completely neglects millions of american potholes as the ranking member on the committee on transportation and infrastructure and given that congress faces major surface transportation reauthorization legislation this year let me focus for a moment on what this budget does to highway and transit infrastructure investment consider this for a moment today china spends nine percent of its gdp per year on infrastructure india spends five percent of its gdp per year on infrastructure yet the united states of america only spends 1 9 percent of its gdp per year on infrastructure woefully inadequate as it stands yet the republican budget cuts highway highway safety and transit investment by about onethird onethird less bridge repair onethird less safety improvement and onethird less bus service is where this budget leads usdestroying familywage highway and transit construction jobs all along the way and placing us in an even less competitive position than we already are against countries like china and india incredible simply incredible over the next six years the current budget baseline investment level for highway highway safety and public transit investments is 331 billion including 316 billion of contract authority from the highway trust fund and 15 billion from the general fund based on the assumptions included in the republican budget the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that the republican budget provides only 219 billion of highway trust fund funding over the next six years in effect the republican budget slashes surface transportation investment by more than 100 billion over the next six years let me repeat that because i want my colleagues to be very aware of what this budget proposes to do in this area today is the 100th day that the republicans have been in control of the house and today they are proposing to cut more than 100 billion from investments in americas future investments that keep our economy moving and help to ensure that america remains a good place to do business one hundred days in control of the house and they want to slash 100 billion from transportation investments they havent brought a single jobs bill to the floor of this house and yet today to mark their 100th day anniversary here we are debating a budget that will destroy half a million highway jobs amazing according to a cbo analysis of the republican budget assumptions this budget will slash current year highway funding from 41 1 billion to approximately 27 billion in fiscal year 2012 a 34 percent cut in year one of the reauthorization bill will destroy more than 490 000 jobs over the coming years west virginia cannot afford a 143 million cut in highway investment next year this investment and its 5 000 goodpaying jobs are critical to our mountain economy and ensuring that rural america shares in the great opportunities provided by our country put simply middle class americans cannot afford the republican road to ruin budget finally the republican budget destroys any pretext that republicans will restore the highway and transit budget firewalls that they wiped away on the first day of their new majority in the 112th congress when congress enacted those firewalls in 1998 to restore the trust to the highway trust fund and keep faith with the traveling public i stood shouldertoshoulder with former republican committee chairman bud shuster we lost that battle on the budget at 3 00 in may 1997 but one year later won the war with enactment of the transportation equity act for the 21st century establishing the budget firewalls which have served the traveling public for the past 14 years as their very first act in the majority republicans broke the trust of the highway trust fund there was a time when republicans were proud of their heritage in leading the way on infrastructure investment they were the party of lincoln and eisenhower to my good friends across the aisle do not let infrastructure investment become a mere

so pleased that you put this special order together to memorialize the contributions that african american women have made in this our month of march a tribute to all women as the democratic cochair of the womens caucus i am particularly proud to talk about some of the accomplishments and challenges quite frankly of african american women in this country it is so obvious that we have to honor some of our ancestors on whose shoulders we stand women like harriet tubman who led slaves out of slavery even at the point of a gun a rifle a strong african american woman that really instilled the kind of selfrespect and selfesteem in the african american community that strength of character that has helped us survive all kinds of tragedies in our community sojourner truth of course who really was engaged very heavily in the womens right to vote movement in the suffrage movement and of course fannie lou hamer in mississippi who fought for the right to vote and rosa parks who fought to end the segregation in the south on accommodation and really moving through history people like madam c j walker first millionaire so many people i could just go on and on naming women in every field of business and entertainment oprah winfrey all the way of course to our very own first lady our own great michelle robinson obama but i think that such a tribute would not be complete if we did not recognize some of the people who are unknown to people some of the unsung heroes within our own community and im thinking of such a woman right now a woman named velvalea phillips velvalea phillips lived in milwaukee wisconsin and graduated from north division high school my alma mater the same school that golda meir graduated from and it was at that time a predominantly white school and she won an oratorical contest and the school was reluctant to give her that prize because she was a black student and of course the majority white student body rebelled and insisted that she win the prize as an orator velvalea phillips later came to be known as vel affectionately as vel phillips went on to run for alderman of the city of milwaukee there had never been a woman who had won a seat on the common council until vel ran and because she shortened her name from velvalea to vel they thought she was a man she didnt put any pictures on her literature so they also did not know she was a black so she was the first woman and the first black person to become an alderman in the city of milwaukee she was the first black woman to graduate from the university of wisconsin law school she was the first black person to become a judge in milwaukee county she was the first black woman to ever serve on a national party committee in either the democrat or the republican national committee the very first black woman she is the first and only african american who has ever won a statewide office in the state of wisconsin she is alive and still kicking and is a major force in the community brainstorming conference of milwaukee a sort of black think tank in milwaukee that talks about all kinds of social situations in milwaukee very thriving organization in our community but even then it would be inappropriate to end this tribute without talking about those unknown women who have contributed so much and i believe that this hour started out with your referencing some of these people madea big mama aunt peaches cousin fannie these people who dug deep into their pockets to pull out a very carefully folded 20 bill to press into your hand as you went off to college to give you some support those people who scrubbed floors and were not proud to try to give you a better life than they had those people who held the family together when all else failed and that is why african americans have thrived and survived to the extent that they have because of the strength of the african american woman in our community i will tell you as a physician gentlelady from the virgin islands that african american women are facing some tremendous challenges right now we live in america and of course african americans are very proud to be american but the fact still remains that there is no level playing field in america for african american women women in general only earn 77 cents for every dollar that a man earns and of course african american women earn even less than that and theyre faced with so many challenges with a very high incarceration rate among african american men african american women are often finding themselves in situations where they are the sole breadwinners in a family where their wages are less than african american men or any men in this country african american women though have continued to show that they are overcomers that they can step outside of their story that they can stand in the truth of their power and continue to inspire generation after generation after generation of african americans and we see this so often when we think of people in our community who have been raised up by single female and single female heads of household but have continued to move forward we look at our own president barack obama he is an african american his mother was not an african american woman but she mirrored the condition of so many african american women in this country finding themselves rearing african american children on their own and that is why i think it is important to come to this floor and to implore our colleagues to not eviscerate the kinds of support that makes so much difference to children like the women infant and children program where there have been efforts to cut that by 747 million efforts to cut head start efforts to cut the maternal and child health block grant efforts to cut out basic kinds of support that african american women need to support their often lonely task of trying to rear children who are already poor and the genius of african american women to cobble together a living where there seems to be nothing is something that i admire a great deal and something quite frankly that i have been a beneficiary of my mother was the mother of nine children im the eighth of nine children and my mother was poor at the point at which i was born my mother had nine children and did not have a high school education she went back to high schoolthis was prior to gedshe went back to high school when i was about 5 years old and she got an associates degree after that and she went on to graduate and become magna cum laude as an adult and all this time she kept us fed with beans and cornbread and rice and plenty of fresh water out of lake michigan she believed firmly in taking us to church and feeding us at the trough of religion and good morality and having compassion and loving justice her very best friend ceria travis who went to church with her has a daughter dr dorothy travis moore who has established a school in milwaukee devoted to helping struggling african american men because they saw how these strong black women worked hard and my mom and mrs travis inspired a whole generation of african american men and women to strive for a life better than they had my mom helped so many young people go on and win college scholarships she used to train them and tutor them to be able to win scholarships from the local masons and elks oratorical contests this is why i cant stop gentlelady from the virgin islands because i had a role model in my own life of a sociological miracle someone who overcame all of the things that had been said she couldnt do so that is why if people tell me that i cannot do something i have what all children should have and that is a background of someone who is close to them that says continuously yes i can yes i can yes i can and as black women we can do it however scarce our resources however austere these budgets are we are not going to go away we are americans we work hard we have built this country and we have provided this country with a lot of genius we have provided original music we have provided inventions and agriculture we have built this capitol with our sweat blood and tears and as african americans we are proud

pollution bills has been very heated at times the debate has exposed very divergent views between the parties here in congress on the importance of clean air and on the value of good health for all americans despite our differences on how we treat air pollution my amendment offers us an opportunity to come together on a bipartisan basis specifically to protect the health of our older neighborsamericas seniors the passage of my amendment will not prevent the passage of the underlying bill if the amendment is adopted it will be incorporated into the bill and the bill will proceed to a vote the amendment i offer today will ensure that we respect the health of our older neighbors our parents and our grandparents by protecting the quality of the air that they breathe seniors are more susceptible than others to the harmful impacts of dirty air and pollution and our neighbors need to understand what is in the air that they breathe so my amendment proposes to do two things one require waste incinerators located within 5 miles of a nursing home an assisted living facility or a hospital to simply use the most effective pollution control methods available two require polluting boilers to notify surrounding communities of toxic emissions without my amendment the gop bill will cause a dramatic increase in the emissions of mercury dioxins acid gases and sulfur dioxide near populations that are particularly vulnerable to pollution the clean air act protects us all from some of the most carcinogenic and dangerous pollutants mercury damages the developing brain and reduces iq and the ability to learn sulfur dioxide is known to interfere with breathing and as a result is especially harmful to seniors some seniors are so sensitive to dirty air and pollution they require oxygen tanks to aid their breathing and a variety of health conditions afflicting seniors is aggravated by poor air quality any increase in hazardous air pollution will disproportionately harm our older neighbors at a time in their lives when they are the most vulnerable we can save lives and we can save money by requiring that these waste incinerators that are located near our older neighbors use the most effective pollution control methods available when it comes to the health and health care costs for older americans my colleagues weve got to be smarter it is not wise to aggravate the respiratory ailments of our older neighbors who likely are on medicare just as it is not wise for the gop to advocate for ending medicare as we know it it doesnt save any money the nonpartisan cbo explained that the gop plan to dismantle medicare would simply shift costs to seniors without addressing the underlying issues actually the gop pollution bills here can be viewed as handing our parents our grandparents and our older neighbors higher medical bills tied to dirtier air so lets be smart lets ensure that waste incinerators located in areas where our seniors live use the most effective pollution controls other industries have done it and this small industrial subset should not receive a special interest carveout while our older neighbors would be disproportionately affected by this gop bill in its current form theyre not the only ones young people and pregnant women are also extremely vulnerable to an increase in the toxic emissions that this gop bill promotes this congress has a duty to prevent such harm from happening when the evidence is so clear one sure way that we can help our families take adequate steps to protect themselves and their children is to ensure theyre fully aware of the dangers that they face from specific pollution sources so this amendment also requires large boilers to notify their local communities of emissions that are likely to increase because of this gop bill that way families can take adequate steps to protect their children from mercury dioxins particulates and sulfur dioxide this information will also enable our local communities to make determinations on where to locate playgrounds and schools we must ensure that our families and communities have all the information they need to make the best decisions for the health of their children and that they have a complete understanding of the location and scale of the threat posed by air pollution the gop bill blocks critical health protections against air pollution the epa estimates that the gops anticlean air bills together mean over 30 000 more premature deaths over 19 000 additional heart attacks and over 200 000 asthma attacks that otherwise would

concerned with one issue that has perhaps eclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this halfyear period of time that related to our national debt and the anticipated expiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks many americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it head on it says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are met first that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year 2012 budget second we need statutory spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can affect the here and now and can be binding for the here and now but we cannot reasonably expect and we cannot ask the american people when making a decision so longlasting and precedentsetting as this one to simply trust us that future congresses will see things the same way we do the only way we can bind a future congress is by amending our law of laws that 224yearold document painstakingly ironed out by some of the brightest men of the last several centuries in philadelphia 224 years ago when we amend the constitution we make it possible to bind a future congress that is what we need to do we have had some interesting debate and discussion surrounding this proposal last friday i listened with surprise and dismay as our president said we dont need to amend the constitution to require a balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident others a momentary blip still others would suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an actual act of budget balancing when that occurred regardless we know that balanced federal budgets are newsworthy indeed because they are very rare i look forward to the day when they are no longer newsworthy when they are customary and the only way to make them customary based on our experience as americans throughout most of our nations history is by amending the constitution to require it to make this a binding and permanent law i was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our senate majority leader senator reid from nevada stated just a few hours ago that he does not like this legislation he made some very disparaging comments about it notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more

"mr president i now choose to turn to another topica topic that is important to many americans a topic that relates to an important anniversary we are recognizing today we are highlighting the third anniversary of president obamas failed stimulus package the president promised 3 years ago that the stimulus would create what he characterized as millions of jobs but today unfortunately devastatingly there are nearly 13 million people in america who are still unemployed and many millions more have even given up on looking for jobs three years ago the white house said that because of the stimulus package unemployment would not exceed 8 percent that has not happened in fact the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 straight months nowthe longest stretch of high unemployment since the great depression the congressional budget office predicts it is going to go even longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive dance software 1 2 million was spent on a train museum 2 million was spent to study ant behavior 762 000 was spent to study improvised musici am not sure what that is but i am sure it is lovely not necessarily deserving of scarce federal resources 300 000 to track weather on other planetsgreat if one lives on another planet not so great if one lives on earth in a country that has accumulated an unprecedented debt exceeding 15 trillion 153 000 for an indoor water park and 712 000 to develop a machinegenerated humor systemin other words a joke machine this big joke is on the american taxpayer unfortunately it is no laughing matter in the last 3 years we have added more than 4 trillion to the national debt we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in our nations history and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit exceeding 1 trillion this week the president submitted a budget that calls for adding 11 trillion in new debt over the next decade his own treasury secretary calls the level of spending unsustainable and it is despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has failed the president has called for additional increases in spending i know the president is a good man i also know he faced a difficult economy when he took office but the president is unwilling to tell the truth to the american people about what lies ahead about some of the challenges we face i think he needs to do so and he needs to acknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can avoid making similar mistakes in the future today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the presidents stimulus rather we must lament a tremendous lost opportunity by this administration to put this country back on the right track over these last 3 years for the sake of future generations i

these days perhaps in the nottoodistant past it was more common but i think it shows that theres an opportunity for actually good bigpicture agreements on what we need to do in general although we may disagree on some of the particulars id like to point out some of the real problems that my colleague from wisconsin alluded to first and foremost i have got a chart here that talks about the amount of money were actually borrowing to make our payments in this country hes right were spending way too much were spending almost 3 6 trillion our revenues only about 2 2 trillion were borrowing almost 40 percent of what we spend you cant do that in your household folks you cant do that in your small business and we shouldnt be doing that and cant do that as the greatest nation on earth and keep our fiscal balance sheets in play right now our debt is almost up to 15 trillion and our deficit has been stuck at 1 3 trillion for the last 3 years the projections are even worse i would like to show a chart that shows the longterm projections given the current rate of spending at our level of revenues which are quite low at this point in time its a little bit busy but theres a grayer portion down below you can see that talks about the actual current law budget thats the stuff that my friend in wisconsin and i have to budget to that the congressional budget office puts out but the real budget is what the committee for a responsible federal budget talks about thats the real longterm debt that were dealing with that assumes unlike the current law budget that were not going to eliminate all the tax breaks to middle class americans different corporations it assumes that were not going to have docs have to pony up a 30 percent cut in their wages to make ends meet and it also assumes that were going to do something to keep the alternative minimum tax from affecting middle class americans i would also like to point out that this is not a good picture you look at whats happened historically were in a really bad situation at this point in time and there are some pretty big historical drivers to this id like to switch to a different chart this chart shows historically where our revenues and our spending have been the top line here is our spending this lacquer line down below is our revenues they have been a little out of whack forever only during the years when we had a democrat president and a republican congress were they back in good shape that was just 15 years ago but you can see that we historically have had our revenues probably in the 18 to 18 5 percent range and our expenditures in the 20 percent range not great but were worse now were at 25 percent and spending and only 14 or 15 percent in revenues to emphasize the point my colleague from wisconsin made so weve got to really work at getting this stuff back under control or were not going to be where we need to be id point out real quick that to that point were actually giving away almost a trillion dollars in tax breaks and i think my colleague has some good points hes going to make in a moment on that and weve got to get this tax code under control as a small businessman you cant possibly do your own tax you cant even come close when i started my veterinary business way back whenim not going to say how old i was my friendbut i could actually do my own taxes thats impossible these days thats impossible and it shouldnt be that byzantine the other piece of the problem here is the entitlement system people dont want to admit this particularly people on my side of the aisle but were going broke here in the medicare system the bottom blue is social security medicaid and other health expenditures is the green and medicare is up at the top there and heres our revenue line were busting through with medicare thats not because of malfeasance yeah theres some waste fraud and abuse that we have got to get under control and im sure we can get it under control but there are some simple economics here in 1960 there were five workers for every one beneficiary right now there are only three workers for every beneficiary and in 2035 there will be two workers for every beneficiaryless money in to take care of more folks back in 1975 we had about 25 million beneficiaries i believe now it is almost 89 million beneficiaries and the cost per medicare recipient has gone through the roof we are living longer hopefully living healthier lives in 1975 we spent about 2 000 per medicare enrollee thats hard to believe in this day and age now its 18 000 so more people more expensive care which is good quality care and frankly fewer workers to provide for the benefits adds up to this huge growth in spending that will be facing us over the next few years unless we get our act together at this point in time"], [0.9868572307750583, 0.01314276922494173, 1, "i rise to ask my colleagues to join me in improving congressional oversight of federal spending by cosponsoring h r

speaker who will follow me on the majority side i recommend he hang near the floor because i will be wrapping up shortly i rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of la roche college founded in 1963 by the sisters of divine providence in mccandless pennsylvania a suburb of pittsburgh it was named in honor of marie de la roche the first superior of the congregation of the sisters of divine providence originally a college for religious sisters it now educates a diverse group of students from around the world offering highquality educational opportunities that continue to reflect its catholic heritage soon after its founding la roche experienced financial difficulties that threatened the schools existence due to the financial strain the congregation at that time seriously considered permanently closing the college however because of the profound and positive impact the school made on the community in the short time its doors had been opened the students state officials and the community leaders urged the congregation and the schools leadership to continue the mission of the school and to keep the school open thankfully due to the outpouring of support from the community in 1970 the board amended its charter to establish la roche college as an independent coeducational catholic institution which it remains today it also joined with the art institute of pittsburgh and diversified its course offerings expanding the areas of study the college would offer including graphic and interior design programs that are among la roche colleges most popular programs today i was proud to serve on the board of trustees at la roche college it was during my time as a trustee that i had the wonderful opportunity to get to know the late monsignor william kerr who served as la roches president for 12 years it was during his tenure that the college established the pacem in terris institute a scholarship program for outstanding collegeage men and women from conflict and postconflict nations such as rwanda and bosnia the institute allows students to receive an education at la roche college to study leadership and diplomacy in return for their agreement to return to their home country after graduation to help engage in the peace process and rebuild their nations the institute successfully reflects the colleges vision and mission to foster global citizenship that program over the years has created a bond with some countries that is unlike any other institution of higher learning in america it has had students go through the program that have gone back to their home countries and have very successfully become leaders in those countries we are better off as a nation and as a global community because of their work and because of that program which initiated and continues at la roche college it was also during my time on the board of trustees in 2004 that la roche college board of trustees appointed sister candace introcaso as the colleges seventh president sister candace began her career in education at la roche in the late 1980s and its under her leadership that the college has continued to expand its global footprint while placing a renewed focus on serving the needs of those in the pittsburgh region i had the privilege of working closely with sister candace during my time as a trustee and as the congressman who now represents la roche college the future is bright for the college under her continued leadership la roche college improves upon itself year after year it continues to expand its academic offerings with more than 50 undergraduate majors 20 undergraduate minors and three graduate programs for six consecutive years it has been named one of the best northeastern colleges by the princeton review and it fields 12 intercollegiate teams on many occasions my office used their facilities for workshops and town hall meetings over the years la roche students and faculty as well as sister candace came to visit my office on a number of occasions to discuss the importance of education to our country and their efforts to collaborate with the greater pittsburgh and western pennsylvania community for the betterment of our entire region next year marks the 50th anniversary of la roche college despite early financial troubles the leadership of the college persevered kept the doors open and always stayed true to

state arkansas sat on the western edge of a growing nation in the late 1800s and it would be the unitedstates marshals and their deputies based out of forth smith arkansas that had jurisdiction over 74 000 square miles an area where countless numbers of dangerous criminals fled into indian territory to escape prosecution home to judge parkers courthouse fort smith became the center of law and order in the western united states throughout much of the late 19th century charles portis 1968 novel true grit first introduced fort smith arkansas to many americans and its role in the history of the unitedstates marshals service an arkansan born and raised in el dorado arkansas in my congressional district charles portis later saw his novel turned into the 1969 movie starring arkansas native and recording artist singer glen campbell and john wayne as unitedstates marshal rooster cogburn and more recently the 2010 remake of the movie featuring jeff bridges in the same role the importance of fort smith arkansas to the unitedstates marshals service is in part why the city will also be home to the unitedstates marshals museum to be funded partly by sales from the unitedstates marshals service 225th anniversary commemorative coin when finished the unitedstates marshals museum will be a world class national museum with over 20 000 square feet helping to share the history and legacy of the unitedstates marshals service most importantly it will serve as a memorial for all of those within the unitedstates marshals service who gave their lives in service to our country today more than 4 000 unitedstates marshals deputy marshals and criminal investigators make up the modern unitedstates marshals service carrying out many of the duties first assigned to them more than two centuries ago our unitedstates marshals and deputy marshals protect the federal judicial system apprehend federal fugitives seize property house and transport federal prisoners and operate the witness security program they continue to risk their lives to preserve and protect law and order the very basic tenet of our american democracy and yes our way of life this bill which will not add a single

theft act of 2012 or simply the stop identity theft act many of you have seen the recent headlines calling attention to the escalating nationwide epidemic of tax return identity theft an unsuspecting taxpayer goes to file their tax return only to be told by the internal revenue service that someone else has already filed and claimed their hardearned tax refund this happened to one of my constituents joan rubenstein who was a 64yearold teacher when her accountant filed her 2010 tax return in april of last year he was told by the irs that she had already filed joan followed advice and filed a police report and reached out to the irs but after 10 months she still had not received her refund only after working with my district office were we able secure her refund which she desperately needed to assist her daughter with her student loan payments for her 2011 tax return joan was informed by the irs taxpayer advocates office that she was okay to proceed with filing her return this year yet shockingly joans accountant filed only to learn that she was once again a victim of tax return identity theft for a second year in a row no one should have to go through the trauma of having their hardearned tax refund stolen and certainly not 2 years in a row and joan is not alone this case unfortunately is not an anomaly my office has been inundated with constituents who have also had their tax refunds stolen and i know this is a rampant problem in chairman smiths district and his home state of texas as well the amount of theft that goes on with this type of case is really astronomical its stories like joans that prompted me to file this legislation that is before us on the floor today the crime of tax return identity theft has quickly emerged over the last few years and congress must act to quickly address this epidemic tax return identity theft wreaks emotional and financial havoc on hardworking taxpayers like joan and costs the federal government billions of dollars in 2011 alone the irs reported thatlisten to these numbers851 602 tax returns and 5 8 billion were associated with fraudulent tax returns involving identity theft thats a 280 percent increase since just 2010 these tax return identity thieves hide behind a veil of technology by stealing social security numbers and filing false electronic returns where the payoffs are almost instantaneous right now more thieves and criminal organizations are turning to this lucrative lowrisk highreward crime because law enforcement lacks the kind of stiff criminal penalties afforded many other forms of identity theft essentially because of the small likelihood of getting caught and the very minimal current penalty it makes sense for these thieves to roll the dice because the chances of getting caught and actually doing any time at all is very low in this instance technology has simply outstripped the enforcement tools that are currently on the books basically this crime is worth it for the criminals who are committing it and we need to make sure that it is not worth it any more so they dont have incentive to continue and they move on to the next thing and then we can go after them for that we must protect the thousands of taxpayers like joan who fall victim to this crime many of whom belong to vulnerable groups like seniors veterans and even minors the stop identity theft act brings together several measures to strengthen criminal penalties and increase the prosecution rate of tax return identity thieves h r 4362 will add tax return fraud to the list of predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft the aggravated identity theft statute was created in 2004 to fight identity theft crimes committed to facilitate other types of felonies however at the time the problem of tax return identity theft was very new and it wasnt included as part of the predicate offenses under aggravated identity theft today it has become an urgent nationwide problem and we must give law enforcement the additional tools needed to combat this crime each of the last two administrations have called for adding tax fraud to the predicate offenses under aggravated identity theft with this change the stop identity theft act will toughen sentencing for tax return identity thieves which will help deter this kind of crime importantly the legislation also expands the definition of an identity theft victim to include businesses and charitable organizations often these organizations have their identities stolen and used in phishing schemes to extract the sensitive information from unsuspecting taxpayers used in tax return thefts essentially what happens and weve all been warned about this you get an email from what you think is your bank or the charitable organization that you are used to giving donations to but its really not because these thieves have stolen that organizations identity and they are asking for your personal information and unsuspecting victims give them that information by the way you should never do that because your bank and charitable organization wont ask you for personal information these thieves then use the harvested information to file thousands of fraudulent tax returns in fact on the irs web site it is noted that this type of phishing scheme is the most common one seen by the irs this amendment to the identity theft statutes will ensure that thieves who misappropriate the identities of any business be it a small business or a nonprofit organization can be prosecuted"], [0.986227173358202, 0.01377282664179802, 1, "i ask
