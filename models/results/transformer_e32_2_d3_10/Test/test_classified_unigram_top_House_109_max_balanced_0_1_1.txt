back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and it will not be like it is now and it will not be business as usual and it will not be well i dont care if you do not like it"], [0.0030056238174438477, 0.9969943761825562, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time as a member of the joint economic committee i rise today to speak on the economic policies of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.003336489200592041, 0.996663510799408, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman from washington for yielding me the customary 30 minutes i yield myself 5 minutes democrats have been saying again and again and again and again the american people want and deserve a clean upordown vote on raising the minimum wage and this rule does not provide for such a vote minimumwage workers want and deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that today so i urge my colleagues to reject this rule i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.003479599952697754, 0.9965204000473022, 1, "it is an honor to come before the house we would like to thank not only democratic leader ms pelosi but the entire democratic leadership mr hoyer mr menendez and mr clyburn our vice chair of the democratic caucus as you know the 30something working group comes to the floor to share not only with members but also with the american people about what is happening good here in the capitol and also what is happening bad here in the capitol and hopefully through a bipartisan effort we can move towards positive change here in the capitol it saddens me to report the fact that this congress need it be whatever poll you look at the american people by 33 percent think that we are doing a good job thirtythree percent of the american people feel that this congress is doing a good job i would tell you that if it was a grade system i would assume that and members i would assume that that would be a failing grade i have two children that attend school and if their grades were based on a 33 percent performance i do not think that they would be moving to the next grade and i think it is important members of congress as we start to look at our responsibilities to the american people not just to our constituents in our districts but to the american people because by them sending us to congress they federalized us to come up here and run this country in the way that it should be i also want to remind the members that this is the peoples house it is not my house it is not mr ryans house it is not ms wasserman schultzs house all due respect it is not your house it is the peoples house in the senate i must add and we must let all of the members we must remind them in the senate someone can be appointed to the senate of course they have elections but in a time let us just say like in new jersey the governor of new jersey the new governor of new jersey has the opportunity who was a unitedstates senator to appoint someone to be the new unitedstates senator from the state of new jersey but in the house with a seat being vacated let us just say someone from new jersey is appointed to be the senator he cannot appoint someone here to the house of representatives he would have to set a special election for that seat to be filled constitutionally so this is the peoples house and so when we start talking about the people of the united states of america we are closer to them than any other i think than any other branch of government i would like to say that on the heels of president bushs speech today on iraqs economy i could not help and mr ryan and i just returned from iraq we visited three cities in iraq and we went to the infamous green zone and baghdad visiting our troops many of them were members of the army soldiers some on their third deployment to iraq i could not help but pay attention and i got a copy of the presidents h11199 speech and he released a 35page 32 pages if you look at glossy cover and all 35 pages of his strategy for victory there in iraq but he talked about the economy today in iraq but i cannot help but say and to the members that it would have been good if the president could have talked about our unitedstates economy i think the reason why he did not talk about the unitedstates economy is the fact that we have record deficits some 3 5 trillion over the next 10 years deficits that is not the kendrick meek report that is not the tim ryan report that is not the congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz report that is reality we are recordbreaking as it relates to borrowing money members from foreign countries this president along with this republican majority here in the house and in the senate has achieved 4 5 trillion in borrowing money from foreign nations more than 42 presidents before him they were only able to among all of those presidents i mean all of them i am talking about since we became a country 4 1 trillion that have been achieved and i want to correct myself i am sorry i have so many numbers here i want to correct myself i am glad mr ryan brought this over 1 05 trillion by this president i said four and i will correct myself right now because in the 30something working group we believe in thirdparty validators and sharing with the american people and the members the truth about what is happening here in the capitol so maybe 4 05 might have sounded a little better but we believe in making sure that we give good information 1 05 trillion this president the last 4 years 2001 to 2005 and he is not done yet 1 01 trillion 42 presidents in the history of this country republican democrat and in their lifetime for some of them very early on were members of the whig party from 1776 to 2000 224 years and this is from the unitedstates department of treasury this is not from the national democratic party or anything like that we just want to make sure mr ryan that we have our thirdparty validators here maybe the president mr ryan could have talked abouit the fact that health care costs increased over 60 percent for small businesses over the last 5 years major companies are cutting jobs and not only their pension plan that they promised but they are following our lead here under this republican majority mr ryan by the fact that we are not only increasing copayments and the wait for our veterans once they leave the military they are following our lead companies like gm delphi merck verizon and now ford are now reprioritizing that means cutting jobs that means cutting back on promises that they promised their employees from the beginning the average family right now in the united states as relates to natural gas are paying three times more than they paid in 2001 the president could have talked about that but he did not he wanted to talk about iraq because he needs to explain himself republican majority they need to explain themselves sixty percent of americans if we like it or not do not believe that our leadership as relates to leading our effort in iraq has a sound plan in getting us out of there so we are going to talk about some of these things tonight we are going to also talk about this ongoing culture of corruption andc cronyism and incompetence this is not the kendrick meek report this is just todays papers this is just today that is outlining a culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence so when historians look back on the 109th congress and the contributions that we made they are also going to look at the void in leadership and leading this country in the way that they should lead we used to give speeches here on the floor mr ryan and you know full well about putting burden on future generations fl 2015 well i can tell the members right now and this is not me speaking they can check with any of the federal agencies that do the reports or the auditor generals that put out reports on an annual basis we are putting this generation in the present in jeopardy so i am so glad that we have the opportunity tonight to come to the floor and i am so glad that the gentleman from ohio is here and i am glad that we have a level of consistency for the american people to come to the floor and share this information i yield to the gentleman from ohio"],

how your daily actions square with what you believe as a catholic looking at this budget i cannot square the moral values of our country opportunity equality and justice with the practical impact that this budget proposal will have on the lives of working american families this year thanks to president bushs taxcutting progtam the unitedstates government will deliver up to 106 billion to the multiple bank accounts of some of the wealthiest americans this government program to help wealthy americans spend more money now forces a false crunch on our resources a 50 billion cut that republicans believe should come from medicaid food stamps and student loans who will feel the impact of these cuts well almost 60percent of all people in nursing homes who are on medicaid and onethird of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans that strive to even the playing field for all american families eight weeks ago across the united states americans saw the faces of other americans staring up at them from television screens scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it poverty is on the rise in our country 37 million americans are now in poverty i a family of two in povertya single mother with her child is living on 1 069 a month about 14 million americans are living on half of poverty a single mother with her child living at half of poverty is trying to survive on 535 a month that is two people living on 123 37 a week and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other americans we will be judged by how we take care of the least of our people we will be judged by our decision to turn our backs on those americans who were driven to cry out helpwe are your neighbors your grandmothers your children i

important that we look at this issue of the irresponsibility of the republican majority they are being very irresponsible and to say that that is fine we will give you what you want of course i think we are going to see more of that kind of action by the republican majority to say that oh we are with you even if we are running the country into the ground we know better we know that we have foreign countries that we are borrowing from because we cant even borrow from ourselves anymore because we have done such a bad job we know we have raised the debt ceiling time after time after time again meanwhile we come to the floor and say our policies are working we know that there are things we should not be doing because you are working every day or you are running your business eyery day you may not be paying attention to everything that is going on not only are we elected but we are paid to watch out for your best interest and also for future generations best interests and they are doing it and i think that the paradigm shift as it relates to the american people paying attention to what they are doing in a way from a fiscal way i think will take place between now and november and so what is so unfortunate abqut this whole situation is that we are supposed to be responsible policymakers on a bipartisan basis and that is not happening right now that is just not happening the american taxpayers are getting mugged knocked down and kicked by this republican majority and the rubber stamp or the rubberstamp congress republican majority that is here now one other thing i want to mention here which i think is very very important just today mr ryan mrs tubbs jones we dont have to go back to weeks or months or 2 years ago or 3 years ago we had a payasyougo provision here individuals decided not to take it up we had an opportunity to raise the minimum wage on behalf of the american taxpayers the republican majority rejected an opportunity to raise the minimum wage for everyday working americans as a matter of fact mr ryan one of the republican leaders said i havent voted in 25 years to raise the minimum wage and if he would have had his way the minimum wage would still be 3 35 versus 5 15 i am so glad that my state joined 21 other states in raising the minimum wage meanwhile we are still here with chisel and hammer in hand as neanderthals on the republican side of the ball and saying oh we dont have to raise the minimum wage we are so indebted to the special interests that we dont even want to bother them of having an american public that is able to pay the rent or pay for their house mortgage or to be able to put gas in their tank we are so invested in the k street project we are so invested in so many other things that we are willing to allow these individuals to suffer but guess what those are the same individuals that are making america america and there are millions of americans that are there and so what is very very unfortunate here is the fact that the republican majority is still boasting about you know we are in charge we are going to continue to keep our foot on the necks of everyday americans that are going in punching in and punching out every day 5 days a week sometimes 6 because they have to work overtime those americans that know what it means to take a 15minute break in the morning and a 15minute break in the afternoon and a solid 30 minutes of lunch if they get that and they better not be a minute late those kind of individuals i think are going to go to the polls this november and say no more they are going to go to the polls and say we are willing to fight for the kind of accountability that we need from this government i am so proud of the 30something working group and the members that come down here and the democratic members that file legislation on behalf of the american people not on behalf of the democratic party not even on behalf of the democratic caucus not on behalf of our leadership but on behalf of the individuals that they represent who woke up early one tuesday morning and voted for representation in this unitedstates house of representatives and i must add the only chamber that you have to be elected to that you cant be appointed to al due respect to the senate but senators can be appointed by governors if a senator was to say hey you know i have had enough i want to go home i want to take care of my grandkids a governor can appoint a senator but in democracy in this chamber in the unitedstates house if one member were to say hey i want to take care of my grandkids i want to spend more time with my kids they have to run for office they have to run for office and they have to be replaced by the people so we have a greater responsibility we have a greater responsibility than the white house than the senate or the supreme court when you look at the three branches government to the american people the oversight house resolution 841 and mr cardozas legislation that calls for the calling in those administrators that are not accountable to taxpayers dollars these are the kind of bills that we must pass one thing i can say mr ryan which is so very important on our side of the ball of saying we want to take this country in a new direction is the fact that we said we will increase the minimum wage we will make our country more energyindependent

about an issue that is of utmost importance to the american people i am constantly amazed at news reports at home when i go home and i watch television news and i read the newspaper and see what is being portrayed as usual for the american public if you just followed those stories you would not believe that there was anything that was good or positive going on in our nation you would not believe that the economy for example was doing very very well so one of the things that i try to do and i know others try to do as well is to try to assist and bring about some truth in reporting so tonight what we would like to do is spend a little time talking about the economy for the american people know better than what they see on the nightly news and what they read in the newspapers in fact so many of the folks that i talk to at home are really tired of the gloom and doom that gets reported on the news and frankly gets stated over and over and over here in congress by some members they are tired of congressmen and women who put politics and partisanship over good policy and i hear so often back home that folks say why cant you just get something done on behalf of the american people well a lot of good things are getting done and we are going to spend a little time tonight talking about our economy and some things that congress is doing and has done to assist the american people to help american families to help american children to help american communities it is important that we do that because there is good news to tell so what we would like to do is spend a little time tonight and review so many of the positive things that have been done to create really an economy that is on the move i would like to begin by just sharing a number of different charts that demonstrate clearly that the economy is growing this is a chart here that i think really crystallizes so many of the good stories that we have to tell this chart begins in the first quarter of 2001 and along this axis here is the annual change in gdp or gross domestic product that is how well is the economy doing as you see for the first number of quarters of 2001 and 2002 it is kind of going along kind of bumping up and down and then there is a remarkable change that occurs in early 2003 from then on from the second quarter of 2003 on what we see is a gross domestic product growth in every quarter 10 quarters in a row of a growth of greater than 3 percent and oftentimes greater than 4 percent in faqt the most recent quarter grew at a rate of 4 3 percent the individual who wants to know how to continue that kind of growth and who is excited about policies that encourage growth would say well what happened what happened at that point to bring that kind of growth about as most people know what happened was that the tax cuts the tax relief that congress enacted on behalf of the hardworking american taxpayers went into effect and that has resulted in this incredible incredible growth in the economy that continues that continues unabated and what congress has an opportunity to do this week is to continue and extend that tax relief hopefully to be able to continue the lines that we have seen grow in the economy this is another chart that demonstrates the kind of response that the american economy has to that kind of activity this talks about the creation of new jobs in our country in fact since the spring of 2003 there have been 4 46 million new jobs that have come about and this chart shows the percent increase each month from early 2002 through the current time you see again there is that remarkable change that occurs in the early part and midparet of 2003 where the growth in the number of jobs is remarkable again the inquiring individual would want to know well what changed there what made it so that we did not have negative growth in jobs we had positive growth in jobs as everybody well knows now that change was the tax relief the tax relief that congress enacted that took place in early 2003 just to put those numbers all together this chart which is a little busy shows two very clearly distinct lines one is the green line down here that is the number of jobs that increase in our nation each month the red line is the level of unemployment and as you see at the beginning of 2003 the unemployment rate was taken up here somewhere around 6 percent and the number of jobs began to increase at this point when the tax relief package went into effect we see that continued increase and in fact right now the unemployment rate is down at 5 percent which is lower than the average for the decades of the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s some economists will tell you that 5 percent unemployment rate is full employment because you have got a number of folks who are between jobs or are working to find other places of employment that is their design so 5 percent is basically full employment the number of new jobs that was created last month 215 000 new jobs so there is good news to tell i have been joined tonight by many of my colleagues and many of them will share some of the same kinds of goodnews stories with you first i would like to yield the time to congresswoman blackburn from tennessee she has been such an incredible leader in this congress in the area of tax relief and in making certain that we enact the kinds of policies here that result in smaller government lower taxes and more opportunity for americans with that let me yield to congresswoman blackburn"], [0.003822922706604004, 0.996177077293396, 1, "if my

political reason they decided not to purchase in the financial markets american debt instruments what would happen to our economy does anybody have that answer i mean i have my own theories but i am not sure could they come over and foreclose i wonder what they would do now here is red china red china it is kind of ironic when you think of red china and here we are piling up this red ink red china piling up red ink and it is all american red ink and in 5 years we have gone from owing the chinese 84 billion to over 200 billion i listen to the debates on the floor of this house i listen to them in committee and when i hear my republican colleagues and my friends on the other side speak about china it is always with trepidation it is concern about taiwan it is looking at china as a potential threat and yet here we are knocking on the door of mao zedongs china saying you know what would you buy this instrument from us give us your dollars i am telling you i think we are putting not only our economy at risk but we are putting our national security at risk it is like having a middle east gulf state operating american ports without doing due diligence that is exactly what it is

in there florida keys and hawaii and the great state of alaska what does it mean well in that 1 16 trillion that mr ryan talked about as it relates to the foreign investment korea owns a little bit of

germany comes in at 65 7 billion this bothers me putting these countries on this map but i just want to make sure because it is up to us to break this thing down so not only the members know exactly what they are doing to the country but not for the country and they understand exactly what is going on here because i do not want anyone to say on our watch that this happened and we did not try to do something about it now the uk quote unquote our friend and partner they own a piece of the american pie at 223 2 billion buying our debt meanwhile the president says follow me the republican congress says we know exactly what we are doing taiwan taiwan people laugh oh taiwan this taiwan what but guess what they own 71 3 billion of the american pie and our debt that means that they own something the president says he wants an ownership society hello it is going to other nations our neighbor canada i am going to put them right here 53 8 billion that they own of our debt that means that we owe them financially we owe them just got finished talking about red china communist china a lot of our jobs are in china a lot of americans have to train chinese workers to take over their jobs and then they are fired and they are put on some sort of government assistance china comes in at a whopping 249 8 billion a whopping 249 8 billion using a lot of our money because they have a

states taxpayers given access to 65 billion in oil and gas from the gulf of mexico costing the taxpayers 7 billion in royalties they should be paying back to the treasury that they did npt get given 2 billion to the ultradeepwater drilling fund they were given that money all for 87 million in contributions and expenses paid on lobbying 14 billion in tax breaks 7 billion in lost revenue for royalties in the gulf of mexico 2 billion in tax subsidies there to the ultradeepwater drilling fund you cant get a return on your investment like that on wall street where can you get a return like that the republican congress of course but that is not limited in fact that is prevalent lets take the health care industry they spent about 173 million on lobbying and campaign contributions yet the pharmaceutical interests 139 billion in additional profits over 8 years the prescription drug bill here which was supposed to cost 394 billion ended up costing close to 790 billion to the american people private insurers will make 130 billion in extra profits in medicare overpayments hmos given a 10 billion slush fund all for 173 million in lobbying expenses and contributions mainly to the republican party take business interests spent 500 million on lobbying we had a corporate tax bill to fix a 5 billion disagreement with europe by the time it was done it cost 150 billion not 5 billion and it never fixed the problem 150 billion in corporate giveaways to special interests on the corporate tax bill 139 billion in additional profits for the pharmaceutical interests 130 billion in additional profits to the hmos and in lost revenue to oil and gas companies close to about 22 billion while oil and gas interests are trading and oil is trading at 66 a barrel all in the house that jack built this is the operative philosophy of the republican congress they have turned the capitol upside down to figure out how much change they can take over from the american people and pass it off to the special interests when the gavel for the speaker comes down it is intended to open the peoples house not the auction house for the last 6 years that gavel has been turned over to the

years college costs and tuition up 38 percent for the american people yet median incomes are down 2 3 percent and yet what does this congress continue to do it continues to turn itself into an auction house for the special interests when college cdsts were up 38 percent the republican congress cut student loans by 13 billion yet we have continued to pass on over the last 4 years 3 trillion in

care costs higher educational costs they have not had a raise in over 5 years and the politics as usual business as usual continues with the policies and making sure that the special interests get

in the northeast and the midwest has skyrocketed but while american families struggle with skyhigh energy bills oil and gas companies are facing an entirely different crisis what to do with all the

companies are reaping huge profits henry hubble the vice president for exxonmobil head of investor relations said you just got to let the marketplace work i agree with the oil companies let the marketplace work now what do i mean by that this congress the republican congress gave big oil 14 billion in taxpayer subsidies to drill for oil i am tired of this corporate welfare you want to do your business plan go drill for oil we are not going to subsidize it so people have to pay three bucks a gallon at the pump and on april 15 have to subsidize the oil companies who are making 100 billion of revenue a year 9 billion in a singlequarter profits up 89 percent tecord numbers and what are we asking the taxpayers to do struggling to make ends meet for housing education health care needs we are going to subsidize big oil and while we are on top of it we are going to cut home heating assistance for the elderly in this country what congress would actually cut home heating assistance for senior citizens yet provide exxonmobil 16 billion to execute their business plan a republican congress of course now this should make sense to you for one simple reason since 1980 the big oil companies have contributed 220 million to the republican party in total to candidates and they get 16 billion in return you cannot get an investment like that even on wall street they are one of the largest contributors to the republican congress and the republican party and they get a huge taxpayerfunded bailout when you consider the refining bill for 2 billion the oil and gas bill the republican congress when it comes to big oil is the gift that keeps on giving there is a cost to this corruption it comes in the stripes and colors of a 14 billion taxpayer subsidy to big oil who are making record profits pharmaceutical companies are one of the biggest contributors they get 132 billion in additional profits in the prescription drug bill you have an energy bill that we talked about you have a corporate tax bill they were trying to figure out a 5 billion problem so what do we do we tbok 150 billion and threw it at that problem who is picking up the tab the taxpayer there is a cost to the taxpayers of this country for the culture of corruption we saw it in the energy bill and now all of a sudden republicans are all upset with figuring out what they are going to do to really punish big oil i say it is time we give the taxpayers back their 14 billion in taxpayer subsidies from the oil companies the 2 billion back from the refiners and let the marketplace work its wonder you want to do your business plan you will do your business plan but i am not having the taxpayer subsidize you all the while we are going to literally cut assistance this winter to our elderly and our most vulnerable you cannot give out money fast enough to the energy companies who are making massive profits and then on the other hand cut funding for those who need it most you cannot have a policy in this country that says to the oil companies who are reaping huge profits that is their business but we should not subsidize their business we are going to give you more while we cut those

professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these

about tax policy in the united states congress since i have been here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and

of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majority in the senate i regret that under the

signing of the peace agreement in nairobi kenya between the government of sudan and the sudan peoples liberation army the signing of this agreement has ended africas longest running war a brutal civil war that spanned 21 years where 2 million people died i congratulate the parties for reaching this agreement i also want to commend president bush secretary of state powell and his team ambassador danforth and all the outside groups for their unrelenting efforts in the support of peace i also want to commend all the countries that played a critical role in the peace particularly norway and kenya now all parties have to live up to the agreement and begin the task of rebuilding the lives of millions of people this would be a good time for the administration to appoint a strong acting ambassador to immediately go to khartoum to help implement the peace agreement this would not be to reward khartoum but to keep pressure on all parties to make sure the agreement sticks and to speak out on the issue of darfur there is nothing like being on the scene every day all day so much has gone into getting this agreement we must do everything to make sure that it lasts it is also important as we look forward that we do not forget the tragedy still unfolding in sudan as i speak women continue to be raped children die from hunger and disease men continue to be murdered by the governmentsponsored janjaweed and new attacks continue to be launched against defenseless villages many of these people have been huddled in camps for over a year put yourself in their shoes for a minute you are uprooted from your home you live in a refugee camp where conditions are terrible you do not know if your family members are dead or alive you are sick weak watching people die all around you from hunger and disease now picture you have been there for over a year the tsunami in south asia demonstrates how quickly and effectively the world can respond to such terrible disasters once again we are reminded that the world has failed the people of darfur i commend the quick and generous response to the tsunami but we must not only focus on disasters as they occur but also to respond to disasters like in darfur that have gone on for decades the peace agreement between the north and south opens new doors for a comprehensive peace throughout the country and dr john garang who will now be vice president of sudan has an opportunity to play a positive role and should go to darfur to help bring about peace i have strongly supported the united states commitment to the united nations since i became chairman of the subcommittee on commerce justice state judiciary and related agencies of the committee on appropriations all unitedstates assessments to the u n have been paid in full but over the past year we have seen the united nations fight an uphill battle on darfur resolution after resolution has failed to have any impact at least two security council members china and russia have threatened to veto strong resolutions from being passed secretary general kofi annan continues to report that the situation in darfur continues to deteriorate and the government of sudan has violated the previous security council resolutions by failing to disarm and prosecute the janjaweed ngos are leaving the region secretary general annan has sent a commission on inquiry to darfur to investigate if genocide has occurred and he has the report in his hands as i speak most people believe there is genocide but whether or not they use that term it still is horrible what is taking place and no matter what you call it the facts remain innocent civilians are systematically being murdered raped and displaced and the world has failed to stop it it is time for the united nations and the international community to respond in a meaningful way i ask secretary general annan to go to darfur to confirm with his own eyes that the situation has not improved then secretary general annan should make bold recommendations and call on the security council to immediately implement them because a strong meaningful resolution should be put forward and could make a difference it is now time for secretary general annan to use his strong moral leadership he is a nobel peace prize recipient and surely the security council would take his recommendations he should use his power and prestige to plead for the people of darfur and if the security council fails to take meaningful action secretary general annan should resign in protest i am not blaming kofi annan for darfur he does not control the security council but i ask him to use his leadership to demand a new course of action from them i believe these actions could turn the attention of the world back to what is taking place in darfur resigning under protest is an act of great moral leadership and this world would respect his actions great men in history have given up their posts to force change in 1973 at the height of the watergate scandal president nixon ordered attorney general elliott richardson to fire the special prosecutor he refused and resigned in protest and later got the presidential medal of freedom william wilberforce a member of the british parliament he could have been prime minister but spoke out to abolish the slave trade and gave up being prime minister of england anything kofi annan can do to get the world to focus on darfur would be greatly admired if in the year 2005 the security council cannot deal with genocide the raping of women and the systematic burning of villages now occurring then i believe it is fair to ask what purpose is the united nations serving in the 21st century i close by adding that just yesterday the new york times reported that villages continue to burn and that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence in darfur just last week fresh attacks killed over 100 people and drove thousands more from their homes where is the international community something needs to be done now this past weekend i watched the movie hotel rwanda i urge you all to go see it it is a movie about how the world stood by as almost a million people were

important and so valuable just a few short weeks ago upon the announcement of the ceasefire i stepped off an american military helicopter that took me directly from the island of cyprus onto the grounds of the unitedstates embassy in beirut coincidentally this was the 50th anniversary of my first visit to lebanon during which i had the pleasure of attending a shakespeare festival at the ruins of baalbak our ambassador took me to see the top leaders of lebanon to discuss the path forward on reconstructing that wartorn land and freeing it from the stranglehold in which hezbollah has held it for far too many years i was shaken by what i discovered in my view the lebanese government fully understands that the flow of weapons from syria and iran to hezbollah must end or they will once again find their nation at war not of their own making but at the same time without a word being said i was left with the distinct impression that the lebanese leaders are petrified of what may happen if they finally confront syrias dictator in damascus a bold decision to ask for international troops to put a full stop to the deadly arms flow to hezbollah could launch yet another round of syriansponsored political assassinations and other bloody attempts to destabilize lebanon with the passage of this singularly important resolution congress is asking lebanons leaders to make a brave and courageous decision to ask the international community to deploy a robust international force to the lebanonsyria border to stop the flow of weapons to hezbollah we are being equally as clear that the united states is ready to pledge its wholehearted support for the lebanese people against syrias campaign of appalling intimidation it is not in lebanons interest nor that of civilization as a whole to accept a world in which terr6rist bands can trigger crossborder conflicts in violation of international law and there will never be real democracy or sovereignty in lebanon as long as hezbollah is armed lets review for a minute how this whole conflict got started hezbollah terrorists probably acting at iranian behest killed three israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others as we meet here tonight the hostages remain in captivity no representatives of the red cross have been allowed to visit them and nobody even knows where they are except the thugs who snatched them from their countrys sovereign soil the u n security council resolution ending the conflict is intended to prevent such aggression in the future and the full deployment of the lebanese armed forces to their countrys southern border for the first time in decades is a long overdue and welcome development a 15 000 troop international force to assist in patrolling that border is a positive step forward but the new security regime is far from perfect it leaves far too much to the discretion of a weak lebanese government and the too easily intimidated lebanese military for example the international force will take no action against hezbollah unless it is requested to do so by the lebanese military it is selfevident that these rules of engagement will have to be reexamined and strengthened but the most obvious flaw in the u n mandate is that it doesnt require an international force on lebanons border with syria it is left up to the lebanese government to request such a force something that causes beirut to quake in its boots because of syrian threats hezbollahs missiles and other major weapons come from syria and iran and virtually all of them are smuggled in via syria to keep those weapons out of its house and out of hezbollahs hands lebanon must hermetically seal its border to military trade until that time we will face the resupply of weapons to hezbollah and the near certain renewal of hostilities let me be clear unless international troops are on the syrian border the conflict between hezbollah and israel will flare again iran syria and their hezbollah surrogates dont miss a minute of sleep caring about peace in the region or september 25 200 6 co lebanese sovereignty they care only about increasing their own power creating instability and destroying the state of israel syrian president bashar alassad whose primary instrument of diplomacy toward lebanon is assassination has said that he would consider an international force deployment on the lebanesesyrian border a hostile act to buck up the lebanese government against syrias threats our resolution pledges unitedstates support for lebanon against syrias campaign of intimidation our resolution also commends the lebanese government for its courageous decision to deploy lebanese armed forces along with unifil on its border with israel the first such lebanese deployment in decades this can be a watershed moment for the middle east the lebanese and their government can achieve true independence and sovereignty if they bring in an international force that can help seal the syrian border they will not only achieve those goals they will usher in a new era of stability with their neighbors and all of us then will have taken a giant stride toward middle east peace 2100 it is up to the leaders in beirut to
