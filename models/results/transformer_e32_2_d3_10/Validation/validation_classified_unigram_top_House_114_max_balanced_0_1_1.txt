hollen is right i have served on the judiciary committee it is there that we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year"], [0.0014483332633972168, 0.9985516667366028, 1, "the city of flint michigan has been hit by a crisis of massive proportion its impact on the longterm health and future success of its residents remains unclear the fact i find most disturbing is that it is a completely manmade crisis it grew out of the same kind of stubborn faith in austerity measures that has handicapped our ability to govern for years it grew out of a failure to protect the flint river from environmental damage it grew out of both a failure to invest in flints crumbling infrastructure and in the willful disregard for the people of that city a city in which more than 40 percent of the residents live below the poverty line and in which the majority of families are african american my colleagues and i are here on the floor this evening to urge every member of this body to understand one thing if we fail to acknowledge the issues that led to the flint water crisis we will see similar and equally devastating events in more and more cities across the country we need to recognize that tunnel vision for deficit reduction creates more problems than it solves the emergency manager appointed by governor snyder instituted a plan to run flint like a business in order to bring it back from the brink of death in the process he sought out the least expensive options for basic needs like water in doing so he decided to pull from the corrosive and contaminated flint river without ensuring the treatment protocol necessary to ensure the water was clean we now know that although the flint river is in poor shape a little additional spending could have prevented this crisis instead flint went the bare bones route leaving a generation of residents to suffer the permanent consequences congress has once more been so focused on reducing the deficit that we have lost sight of our responsibility to govern only a few months ago did we finally abandon the absurd policy of sequestration which has hampered the functioning of countless programs over the past several years the benefits of austerity and small government are questionable at best flint has proven that and we would all be wise to remember it unfortunately that is not the only lesson that we can take away from this crisis this congress has made undermining environmental and energy regulations one of its core missions in the first 100 days of the 114th congress it voted on more environmental and energy issues than on any other topic and not a single one was aimed at protecting resources like the flint river from the kind of contamination that allowed its water to corrode lead pipes if reducing the deficit has been the first priority for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle allowing corporations and big businesses to take whatever liberties with our environment they choose has to be a close second under the majority of this house our babies would choke on smog before we limit the amount of pollution a single smokestack can spew out our streams and rivers would poison even the fish swimming in them before we would set restrictions on where these companies can dump their chemical byproducts our forests and farmlands would turn barren before we would question the longterm impact of fracking it took years to turn the flint river into the downright dangerous water source that has caused so many problems but for other rivers lakes or streams there may still be time to repair or prevent the damage that we have done flint should move us to strengthen not weaken our environmental protections there is one more lesson to learn here and it is perhaps the most important the infrastructure in flint like in so many other cities is outdated and no one at the local state or federal level seems willing or capable of making the necessary investments today in our oversight and government reform committee hearing one of the topics of concern was that even if individual homes had replaced their old lead pipes the citys pipes would still have caused a major problem that is a matter of infrastructure at the most basic level in my home state of new jersey we spent more than a decade leading the way in the battle against lead poisoning but with the onset of governor christies administration all these advances have also come to an abrupt halt there there are now 11 cities with levels of lead higher than what has been reported in flint right in my state of new jersey this contamination from lead comes from paint instead of water nonetheless it is a reflection of the reduction and diminution of services and resources to make our environment safe for our communities two of these cities are right in my district still governor christies administration has ignored the problem and thoroughly failed our children by choosing not to fund our states lead abatement fund here at the federal level we can take this even further our failure to invest in transportation and energy infrastructure is building up to a crisis of a different kind a time when our roads our bridges and our power grids begin to fail there are so many lessons we need to learn from flint i have a number of colleagues who are here with me this evening who have raised their voices in support of the people of flint and who i know agree with me that this must be a watershed moment we need to change course to prevent this from happening again and ensure the future of our nation before i turn this over i want to take a moment to add that there are a number of organizations coalitions and other associations that consistently are dedicated to protecting our natural resources they defend the clean water act and they fight for the clean air act i hope to see more of them fighting for flint in the near future i yield to the gentleman from michigan who not only represents the district in which there is flint but he is a

leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of

beatty on ensuring public safety your leadership both congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries has been bold it has been visionary not just as the result of the very recent tragedies but for many many years even before both of you came to congress so it is an honor serving with both of you in this body thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening also i want to just thank congresswoman robin kelly who is the vice chair on the gun violence task force she also chairs the cbcs health braintrust i thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem which it is i rise this evening with my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to call on congress to do somethingto do somethingabout the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities since the start of the yearjust 11 days agonine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides my thoughts are with the victims family at this very terribly difficult time we have to do something enough is enough congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence whether it is charleston oak creek sandy hook the streets of oakland or wherever too many people have already lost their lives too many families have buried loved ones and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence now is the time for action our constituents are demanding action the country is demanding action i have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents and i know other members are also hearing from their constituents they are calling for action as well earlier today in my own district oakland city council president lynette gibson mcelehany buried her grandson 17yearold torian hughes who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before christmas this has been a very difficult period for council member mcelehany and her family so in addition to our prayers not only for my council members family but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence we must do something we must do something in all of their memory let me be clear congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents their families and communities last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of americans in applauding president obamas actions to reduce gun violence in our nation thanks to the presidents leadership there will be more background checks better enforcement of existing gun laws improved mental health services and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence but more action is needed to stop the more than 30 000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year congress must pass commonsense gun reform like closing the gun show loophole bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans and gun owners congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services but this should not be an excuse of course to do nothing on gun safety we have got to provide the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nations gun laws as a member of the appropriations committee i have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe we must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcements ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue that is why i introduced last year h r 1449 the tiahrt restrictions repeal act which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks these data restrictions are commonly called the tiahrt restrictions they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyedmind you destroyedwithin 24 hours prohibiting the atf from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers this is outrageous we have got to restrict and repeal these tiahrt amendments right away it will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals it is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes the tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers law enforcement and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community of course many of us are proud to support congresswoman kellys bill which would allow the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue and the consumer product safety commission to regulate firearms the time for action is now lets start listening to the american people and insist that congress do something it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this bodyfor yearsto get these sensible bills passed the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that congress can act no more excuses we should support congressman thompsons proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence the speaker should do this now so we cant continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about congress we need to do our job we have been trying many of us the congressional black caucus and others especially democrats for many years to try to get the speaker to bring these bills to the floor so what did the president do he had to do something but no more excuses congress needs to act so i thank congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries for this very important special order hour and for your tremendous leadership"], [0.0018579959869384766, 0.9981420040130615, 1, "yesterday i spoke about puerto ricos debt crisis and how there must be a sense of urgency because without action bondholders will be paid but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus

every high school i visit the questions are about donald trump is he going to be our next president is it true that he wants to revoke our citizenship and deport us to the countries our parents came from is it true he wants to round us up mr gutirrez and deport us all it is very sad when the questions a congressman gets from american high school students are about how much they should fear their own government whether their own government is going to break up their families whether their own government is going to treat them not as citizens and as equal partners but as outsiders and pariahs in their own country when they hear that trump is leading in the polls they think that means there is a pretty good chance that he will be the next president when they see him on tv shows like jimmy fallon not to mention cnn and fox news they get the feeling that he is a celebrity that all of us in america admire when they hear that trump is hosting saturday night live not just being a guest but actually hosting even after saying mexican are mostly rapists criminals and drug dealersthey get the impression that calling whole groups of people rapists criminals and drug dealers based on their ethnicity or national origin is basically okay with us in america the real question these chicagoarea high school students have is hey gutierrez what are you going to do to defend us from donald trump what are you going to do to stand up for us this leads to an intense discussion about american politics and i ask the students right back what are you going to do to stand up for yourselves for your

know that 93 percent of latinos under the age of 18 are citizens of the united states and that every 30 seconds a latino citizen turns 18 that is about a million a year for the next decade or so if they are half as motivated as the young people i am talking to in chicago donald trump could have a tremendous impact on the youth vote in the coming election but lets be honest do we really want to motivate civic participation through fear of deportation racial profiling and families being broken up these are american teenagers growing up to distrust their government trump wants to take us back to the good old days of race relations which apparently means the 1950s when president eisenhower evicted millions of immigrants and unitedstates citizens from the united states dr carson who believes that human history is only about 5 000 years oldthat is what he says we have only been around 5 000 yearssays of mass deportation schemes i think its worth discussing here in the house we have considered measures to deport children more quickly to make groups more distrustful of the police and to delay homeland security funding testifying on one of these bills before the rules committee last year i made the unfortunate but real suggestion that republicans were gravitating toward mass deportation policies which provoked a response from the chairman mr sessions he said gutierrez there is no one in responsible republican leadership that has said we should deport 13 or 11 million people and i find it extremely distasteful that people would come here and suggest things that we have not suggested well now that people are suggesting mass deportation openly and are gaining in the public opinion polls in the republican party i wonder why there is so much silence from the republican members of this body but it is not just young latino voters in chicago that are being motivated by republican attacks when republicans attack planned parenthood and block laws to guarantee equal pay for women that motivates women to register and vote when republicans celebrate people who will not issue marriage licenses to two men or two women a lot of people in the lgbt community get motivated to register and vote when republicans rail against unions and block increases in the minimum wage while of course they earn 174 000 a year and block environmental standards and block sensible gun laws a lot of working class and middle class americans get motivated to register and vote together with those young people i talked about at those high schools we are forming a very very powerful coalition

believe that we need to provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so once again i urge members to support change and stand with veterans not the bureaucrats and the special interest groups and the status quo i urge members to oppose the takano substitute i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9957636594772339, 0.9957636594772339, 0, "told us that the energy

have bought them myself they are the same as the old bulbs except that they last longer they use less electricity and they save consumers money we have heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict consumer choice but if you have shopped for light bulbs lately you know that simply isnt true modern incandescent bulbs compact fluorescent light bulbs and leds of every shape size and color are now available consumers have never had more choice the efficiency standards spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers critics of the efficiency standards claimed that they would cost consumers money in fact the opposite is true when the standards are in full effect the average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets worse the rider now poses an additional threat to unitedstates manufacturing the bipartisan 2007 energy bill requires the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is this rider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb the burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania ohio illinois across our region it would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing this rider aims to reverse years of

passed congress in 1961 if you mention foreign aid to many americans it raises their blood pressure members of our communities often are concerned about foreign aid to other countries because they are just not quite sure where that aid is going and what that aid is accomplishing it is important that we as members of the house of representatives legislatively communicate to america how americas money is being spent in foreign countries it is important that we are accountable and that that money that aid is accountable to the taxpayers it may shock you madam speakermaybe it wontbut congress has never passed a law requiring transparency and accountability of foreign aid i will use a different phrase we have never audited our foreign aid to see if it is working and to see what it is doing so people can see whether it is successful or not the american public is uninformed about how much we spend and why we spend that money a recent publish what you fund study rated half of unitedstates agencies in the poor category when it came to transparency of aid transparency is important because it sheds light on where the money is spent it is a lot harder to steal money if everybody knows where the money went and what it was for the american people have a right to know what we are doing with their money there are a lot of success stories but many americans dont know about them so it is important that we post that information and that the agencies that help in foreign aid assistance post that information on the web so we know who is getting the money and what they are doing with that money transparency will help foreign aid it will make it harder for bad actors to steal that aid it will make those who implement our programs work more vigilantly knowing the information will also be posted online it will educate the american public about all the ways our country is helping other people around the world as i said there are a lot of success stories where people are better off because america is helping them transparency by itself however wont save all of foreign aids problems but without transparency those problems will not be solved we also need to evaluate our foreign aid program so we know what works the key portions of this bill are transparency of the aid and evaluation of the aid evaluate that aid to see if it is working and if it is working may continue to do that aid evaluate aidif it is not working then we cut it off and do something else we have all heard about the boondoggles of foreign aid big infrastructure projects are especially prone to waste and mismanagement that is why it is so critically important that as part of this bill being implemented licensed engineers who know how to do these infrastructure projects are more involved with their expert input and operational skills let me give you some examples of where foreign aid has been mismanaged schools are being built by americans overseas but some of those schools never had a student attend them the special inspector for iraq reconstruction found out that at least 8 billion in american taxpayer dollars was lost to fraud waste and abuse 44 million was spent on a residential camp to house international police trainers the camp included an olympicsized swimming pool the problem is swimming pool and all it was never used the 43 million natural gas station in afghanistan was built by the department of defense when it built the same kind of gas station for 500 000 in pakistan let me explain that again american taxpayers built a 43 million natural gas station besides the enormous outrageous cost nobody ever used the gas station in afghanistan so rigorous evaluations of our foreign aid are important because they can tell us whether or not we are really making a lasting impact we have a long way to go and the state department really doesnt have a system in place to keep track of the dollars spent on evaluation of those projects the state department can only tell how much it plans to spend in the future but as soon as it spends that money on evaluations it has no way of tracking where the money went so the state department cant even tell how many evaluations were even done last year on the aid that we are already spending even in its policy the state department is moving in the wrong direction its new evaluation policy lowers the amount of evaluations that must be done usaid has some troubling signs as well usaid spent less money on evaluations in 2014 than it did in 2013 to solve some of these problems with transparency and with accountability of our foreign aid representative connolly and myself have introduced h r 3766 the foreign aid transparency and accountability act this bill requires the president to issue guidelines requiring tough evaluations and on transparency it codifies what is already being done and increases the amount of information required to be posted online including actual expenditures and evaluations so everyone knows what we are doing and whether it is working or not we need to be reporting on more foreign aid in a more understandable way the american people want to know where their aid is going what it is for and if that aid is effective transparency and accountability for our foreign aid this is a commonsense bill and it doesnt cost any money i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9887539148330688, 0.9887539148330688, 0,
