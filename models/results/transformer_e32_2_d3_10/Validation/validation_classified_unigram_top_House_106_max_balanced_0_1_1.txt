of about 60 members who have committed to promoting children first in the national agenda we look forward to hearing from mrs tipper gore the wife of the vice president on the mdrch 25 1999 issues of mental health services for children keeping that in mind i am very concerned with the budget as proposed by the majority leadership because our children must face the challenges of competing in a

reduces domestic spending in programs aimed at protecting the interests of children allow me to call the roll a program of which many members of this house have testified that they graduated from head start is being cut 501 million a 10 percent cut the wic program that provides for women infants and children being cut 425 million job corps which has allowed many inner city and rural community youth to find an opportunity out of the seat of degradation cut 141 million child care there is not a time that i go home to my district when women and men parents who say give me the ability to work provide child care and help me provide child care for my children sometimes onethird of their income 119 million the summer youth program where a mother gave me the good news of her young person who

in the spirit of hershey and bipartisanism i come to request a budget that protects the social security trust fund for americas citizens i rise to request a budget thact will protect the medicare trust fund we must authorize a budget that will protect the social security trust fund while women tend to collect benefits over a longer period than men because of a greater life expectancy women on average receive lower monthly social security benefits since they have lower earnings and are more likely to be widowed or unmarried in retirement the majoritys budget proposal does not protect women or children or the social security trust fund under this budget proposalprograms directed toward improving the quality of life for women and children are the first programs to be reduced and cut in order to give a tax break to the wealthy the majority is suggesting that their budget proposal will save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment and to modernize public schools educating americas children should be our number one priority our

improvement of the human rights these last couple weeks i am not so sure during the weeks approaching the vote for permanent normal trade relations for the peoples republic of china corporate ceos flocked to the hill to lobby for increase unrestricted trade with china they talk about access to 1 2 billion potential consumers in china what they do not say is that their real interest is in 1 2 billion chinese workers workers whom they pay wage on the level of slave labor these ceos will tell us increase trade with china will allow human rights to improve democracy will flourish with increased free trade as we engage with china but as these ceos speak their companies systematically violate the most fundamental of human and worker rights in the new report made in china the role of unitedstates companies in denying human and worker rights released by charles kernaghan and the national labor committee we see evidence of american corporations exploiting the horrible conditions of human rights in the peoples republic of china companies such as huffy and nike and walmart are contracting with chinese sweatshops to export to the united states often with the assistance of repressive and corrupt local government authorities 1 800 huffy bicycle workers have lost their jobs in ohio as huffy shut down its last three remaining unitedstates plants over the last 17 months in july of 1998 huffy fired 850 workers from its celina ohio plant where workers earned 17 an hour huffy now outsources all of its production to developing nations such as china where laborers are forced to work 15 hours a day 7 days a week and earn an average of 33 cents an hour less than 2 percent of what ohio huffy bicycle workers earned walmart makes its line of kathie lee gifford handbags in china there are a thousand workers at the factory where they put in 14hour shifts 7 days a week 29 or 30 days a month one off day per month the average wage of the factory is 3 cents an hour workers live in factory dormitories housed 16 in a room their id documents have been confiscated they are allowed to leave the factory only for one and a half hours a day for half of all factory workers rent for the dormitory exceeds their wages workers earn nothing at all and in many cases owe the company money these people are indentured servants to kathie lee and to walmart some would simply call it slavery the findings in charles kernaghans report illustrates why democratic countries in the developing world are losing ground to more authoritarian countries in the developing world democratic nations such as india are losing out to more totalitarian governments such as china democratic nations such as taiwan are losing out to more authoritarian governments such as indonesia where people are not free and workers do as their told the share of developing country exports to the unitedstates from democratic nations fell from 53 percent 10 years ago to 35 percent today corporate america wants to do business with countries with docile workforces that earn belowpoverty wages and are not allowed to organize to bargain collectively in manufactured goods developing democracies share of developing country exports fell 21 percent from 56 to 35 percent corporations are relocating their manuficturing bases to more authoritarian regimes from democratic countries where workers do not talk back for fear of being punished western corporations want to invest in countries that have poor environmental standards no worker benefits belowpoverty wages no opportunities to bargain collectively and worse as developing countries make progress toward democracy as they increase worker rights and create regulations to protect the environment the american business community punishes them by pulling its trade and investment from developing democratic countries to totalitarian governments and developing countries decisions about the chinese economy are made by three groups the chinese communist party the peoples liberation army which owns many of the export factories and western investors which of these three want to empower workers does the chinese communist worker want the chinese people to enjoy human rights i do not think so does the peoples liberation army want to close the labor camps i do not think so do western investors want chinese workers to make better wages have more democracy and bargain collectively i do not think so none of these groups has any interest in changing the status quo in china i repeat none of these groups western investors the chinese

of goods manufactured by imprisoned workers congress needs to know more about working conditions in chinese factories before we vote on permanent mfn for china american people need to know more about how our major corporations are behaving outside the borders of the united states before we vote on permanent mfn for china based on evidence released into the kernaghan report many of us in the

in what the republican leadership brought to floor in the form and guise of the commerce justice state appropriations as ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims i am mostly concerned about the latino immigration fairness act lifa the phrase compassionate conservatism has very hollow meaning if you just talk the talk and not walk the walk this lifa proposal is the modern day civil rights issue of our time and just 12 days to election day the republicans are thumbing their noses at immigrants who have contributed to our society and are trying to play by the rules i say not deal to this proposal and i urge a no vote this involves amnesty for immigrants who have paid their dues and have been in this country since 1986 parity for liberians guatemanlans haitains and hondurans and restoring section 245 i which allows immigrants to adjust their illegal status pay a fee and remain in this country with their spouses and children these are reasonable proposals and the republican leadership has a blind eye for fairness for justice and equity the republican proposal to provide relief to only 400 000 immigrants who were unable to take advantage of the 1986 law for those entering the country before 1982 is unacceptable it is unacceptable because it leaves and locks too many people out this is a proposal that is thinly veiled as an open door but it really is a feeble attempt to play up to the hispanic vote during the political season the republican legislation is a piecemeal correction of the flawed implementation of the 1986 legalization program basically those individuals who sought the counsel of a specific lawyer and filed suit with him are protected while countless others are left out of those people who are covered in the flawed proposal less than 40 are expected to prevail if the gop acknowledges that the 1986 law was not implemented correctly they should try to right the wrong entirely not pick some winners and losers based on what law firm they signed up to represent them also it is important to understand that this amnesty program in fact is just a long overdue update in the registry provision of the immigration and nationality act the registry provision gives immigrants who have been here without proper documents an opportunity to adjust to permanent status if they have been here for a long enough time and have nothing in their background that would disqualify them from immigrant status the legislation would just update the cutoff date for registry which is now set at 1972 then there is juan gonzalez who has been working for a construction company in houston texas for more than 13 years recently he lost his job because he was not able to present his employer a renewed employment authorization since then his family is living a nightmare juan and his wife luisa are having problems and close to a divorce they lost their home and rented a 2bedroom apartment unfortunately their children are paying the consequences we also need to remain ever vigilant on nacara parity this would address an injustice in the provisions of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of 1997 nacara nacara currently provides qualified cubans and nicaraguans an opportunity to become lawful permanent residents of the united states the proposed legislation would extend the same benefits to eligible nationals of guatemala el salvador honduras and haiti the bill that the republicans have brought to the floor has completely left nacara parity out i say no deal and a no vote like nicaraguans and cubans many salvadorans guatemalans hondurans and haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable political and economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s the united states has a strong foreign policy interest in providing the same treatment to these similarly situated people in addition returning migrants to these countries would place significant demands on their fragile economic and political systems like senator jack reed i have worked very hard to ensure that the 10 000 liberian nationals who have been living in the united states since the mid1980s and have significantly contributed to the american economy are not deported this legislation should also include these liberian nations if the latino immigrant fairness act is not enacted hundreds of thousands of people will be forced to abandon their homes will have to separate from their families and return to countries where they no longer have ties the inclusion of the latino immigrant fairness provisions would evidence our commitment to fair and evenhanded treatment of nations from these countriesand to the strengthening of democracy and economic stability among important neighbors the republican proposal creates a v visa for people waiting in the family backlogs but not all including us citizens this counterproposal treats the family members of some legal permanent residents better than us citizens the gop proposal leaves out us citizens applying for their children over the age of 21 ironically the gop fails to help even united states citizens seeking to reunite with their spouses and children if the spouse of the child fell out of status for six months or more in contrast the latino immigrant fairness act 245 i proposal would cover all people in the pipeline to becoming legal equally i say no deal and a no vote the republicans are failing to correct their flawed legislation of 1997 and 1998 it was the republicans who passed piecemeal programs in 1997 and 1998 for some refugees these flaws failed to correct years of uneven treatment to legitimate refugees from central america haiti and does nothing for liberian nationals it is baffling why today the republicans are now turning their backs on the lifa proposal for long time refugees that have been in the unitedstates for years worked hard and paid their taxes when a few short years ago they advanced these same proposals in conclusion there is not compassion here congress should stop trying to trade some deserving immigrant groups for others and move to help all deserving immigrants willing to play by the rules paytaxes and work hard in the united states

decisionmakers in china who gains from the system the way it is in china who is in charge in the peoples republic of china first the chinese communist party makes most decisions in that country second the peoples liberation army which owns many of the export businesses in china the big manufacturing concerns and third the western investors are very influential that have businesses set up in china

talking about hmo reform or managed care reform one of the things that i want to really stress is that there is a major difference between the approach that the democrats have been taking on the issue of hmo reform versus the approach of the republican leadership a lot of times i worry that americans and our constituents think that what we are proposing on both sides of the aisle is essentially the same and that everyone is trying to do something to protect patients rights during this managed care reform debate but i just think it is important to stress the differences i really feel very strongly that the patients bill of rights the democratic bill that has been put forward and is cosponsored by almost every member on the democratic side really protects patients rights whereas the republican leadership bills that have been put forward both in this congress and in the previous congress really do not do an adequate job of protecting patients and too often look towards the interests of the insurance industry instead in the last session of congress in the last 2 years in 1997 and 1998 there was some debate on the issue of hmo reform but the issue was essentially left unfinished in the 105th congress in the last congress on the house side the democrats patients bill of rights was defeated by just five votes when it came to the floor it was considered on the floor as a substitute to the republican leaderships managed care bill which did pass and which in my opinion was really not a good piece of legislation and did not do anything significant to protect patients in fact the republican leadership in the house has reintroduced a bill in this session of congress that is virtually identical to what it moved last year on the senate side the senate republicans in the socalled help committee approved a managed care bill which really in my opinion is a sham reform bill and does not allow patients to sue the insurance companies but does allow the insurance companies and not the doctors and patients to define what is medically necessary what types of procedures what length of stay what kind of operations would be performed and would be acceptable under an individual insurance policy i just wanted to if i could take a little time this evening to talk about why this republican bill that passed the senate the republican leadership bill in the senate really does not do an adequate job of trying to protect patients rights if you look at the bill that passed the senate or that came out of committee i should say in the senate this year it leaves out more than 100 million americans twothirds of those with private health insurance it fails to grant key protections needed by children women persons with disabilities and others with chronic conditions or special health care needs and it allows medical decisions to continue to be made by insurance company executives instead of by health care professionals and patients the main difference that i have tried to point out between the democrats patients bill of rights and the republican leadership bills that have been sponsored in the house or in the senate really come down to two points and that is that the republican bills really leave it up to the insurance companies to decide what kind of treatment you are going to get and with regard to enforcement they do not have adequate enforcement because if you want to appeal a decision about your treatment that you felt that you should have a particular operation you should be able to stay an extra day or so in the hospital if you try that appeal there is really no process whereby you can appeal the decision of the insurance company and be successful and certainly if you suffer damages you cannot sue for those damages under the republican bill what the democrats tried to do on the senate side in committee in the help committee when this republican hmo bill came up they tried a number of times through amendments to improve the republican bill all those democratic amendments were essentially defeated but i wanted to give you a little idea if i could about the kinds of things that the democrats were trying to do to improve what was essentially a bad bill that did not provide adequate protections for patients in hmos the committee republicans in the senate rejected on a 108 party line vote an amendment by senator ted kennedy to extend the scope of the bill to all privately insured americans as i said the republican bill leaves more than 100 million people unprotected because most of its patient protections are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance and that is selffunded employer plans the committee republicans also rejected on the same 108 party line vote senator kennedys amendment on external appeals again as i mentioned before the republican bill does not create a truly independent external review of plan decisions so if you feel that you are not getting covered adequately and you try to appeal there really is no effective external appeal under the committee bill the republican bill the socalled external review is controlled by the hmos and contains loopholes to allow hmos to delay or prevent patients from appealing a bad medical decision by an hmo bureaucrat many hmo decisions could not even be appealed under the republican bill just to give you another idea of some of the examples i talked about the issue of medical necessity and how it is defined the committee republicans in the senate rejected again on a party line vote 108 an amendment offered by senator kennedy to define the term medical necessity and to prohibit hmos from arbitrarily interfering with medical decisions again just to give you an example of how this operates this amendment would have prevented insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of the treating physician on issues relating to the manner in other words the length of stay in the hospital or the setting inpatient versus outpatient care it would have stopped hmos from overruling doctor and going against accepted and best practices of medicine the committee republicanpassed bill does nothing to protect patients when an insurance company bureaucrat tells them they must have a medical procedure on an outpatient basis or be discharged from the hospital prematurely the republican bill allows hmos to continue to define what is medically necessary giving them the ability to deny promised benefits another example the issue of emergency room care many of my constituents have complained to me that their hmo policy does not allow them to go to the emergency room when they think it is necessary or they have to go to a different hospital that is pretty far away if they want to go to an emergency room they cannot go to the hospital near where they live or where they work well senator murray tried to put in an amendment that again was rejected on a party line vote 108 to strengthen coverage for emergency care under the republican bill it is not clear whether a true prudent layperson standard applies to all of the plans covered prudent layperson says that if the average prudent person would think it was necessary to go to the emergency room then you can go to whatever emergency room is close by and readily available well many insurance policies many hmos do not allow that and so the democrats are saying we want to have that prudent layperson standard put into the hmo reform bill instead what happened is that in this case again the ability to apply that prudent layperson standard was rejected by the committee and what that means is that under the republican bill there still is no guarantee that you can go to the closest emergency room or that even if you go to the emergency room and later the hmo decides well you really should not have gone because it was not really an emergency that they can just deny coverage and say you shouldnt have gone to the emergency room therefore were not going to pay for the emergency room care another example that i think is important is with regard to specialists many of my constituents complain that their hmo reform bill does not provide them with access to specialists that they may need in a given circumstance senators harein and reed had an amendment to this republican bill that again was rejected along party lines that would ensure that patients have access to needed specialists under the republican bill patients could be charged more for outofnetwork specialty care even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan so if you decide that you want to go to a doctor i will give you an example perhaps you want to go see a pediatrician but as many people know today that for children there are pediatric specialists for different areas of pediatrics under the republican bill if there is nobody that has that specialty and you decide that you want to see that kind of pediatrician for your child then you can go out of the network but you have to pay for it again what we were saying with this democratic amendment is that access to specialty care should be provided outside the hmo if there is no one within the hmo that has that specialty and is part of the network but again that was an amendment that was rejected i will only mention one more effort on the democrats part to try to improve this bad bill if you will and there are many others but i will only mention one other one and that was senator kennedys amendment again rejected on a 108 party line vote with regard to liability the republican bill fails to hold limos accountable when their actions result in injury or death i mentioned this before you cannot sue the republican plan would protect most hmos from liability even when someone becomes disabled or is killed senator kennedys amendment in the democrats patients bill of rights would allow 123 million patients who receive coverage through private employers to hold their hmos and health insurance plans accountable under state laws for their abuses this is one of the loopholes if you will in the current law and that is that if you are not covered by certain state laws and your health insurance comes from your private employer oftentimes you cannot sue we were trying to correct that as well if i could just say that basically what i am trying to point out tonight is that there are major differences here and that when we look at what is happening on the issue of hmo or managed care reform it is obviously important that we have an opportunity in this session of congress to get a vote on this issue one of the criticisms that i have of the republican leadership is that frankly it is now april almost may and they have not even allowed us to have any kind of a vote there has not been any movement in subcommittee in the committee on commerce that i am a member of or in the full committee to bring any kind of hmo or managed care reform to the floor so we need to at least start the movement but when that movement starts and when we do have an opportunity to vote on hmo reform we have to understand that there is a major difference between the patients bill of rights which is being brought forth by the democrats and the republican leadership proposal now you do not have to take my word for it one of the things that i think is important is that we look at some of the commentators and what they are saying about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on this issue but i wanted to read if i could all or some parts of an editorial that appeared in the new york times on saturday april 10 earlier this month that talked about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on the issue of patient rights just about everyone on capitol hill professes interest in producing legislation that protects patients from unfair health insurance practices but the prospect of actually passing meaningful protections as opposed to talking about it is uncertain president clinton tried to whip up support for democratic proposals but the republicans are balking at democratic plans as too burdensome on the managed care industry yet it is the democratic proposals that more fully reflect the recommendations of a presidential advisory commission to improve health plan quality the republican senate bill s 326 sponsored by senator jeffords of vermont is too limited to accomplish that purpose the bill which was approved by the senate help or health education labor and pensions committee on a straight party line vote of 108 contains some consumer protections but it is unacceptable because most of the provisions would apply only to 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers leaving 110 million americans in other plans unprotected the republican bill would grant appeal rights to an additional 75 million privately insured individuals but those rights would be quite restrictive appeals to an external reviewer would be allowed only when an insurer refused to pay for a procedure on the grounds that it was not medically necessary or was experimental critics say this would give health plans power to limit appeals by simply asserting that a denial is not based on medical necessity it would exclude appeals where a plan unilaterally decided that the benefit was not covered under the contract even if medical judgments were involved in that contract interpretation the republican bill does not adequately ensure access to specialty care by allowing a patient to see an outofnetwork specialist if the plan has an insufficient number of specialists available both the senate democratic proposal which has white house support and a bipartisan bill sponsored by senators john chafee joseph lieberman and others would be substantially stronger in allowing external review of coverage disputes and defining medical necessity and in giving enrollees greater rights to take health plans to court the insurance lobby has already embarked on a media blitz to defeat any new regulations as too costly but consumer protections under the democratic plan would increase health plan costs by only 2 8 percent according to congressional budget office estimates made last year health plans should be made to deliver what they promise their enrollees and held accountable when they fail i think that new york times editorial really sums up what i am trying to say tonight which is the fact of the matter is that if the patients bill of rights the democratic patients bill of rights would be substantially stronger in almost every aspect of managed care reform over the republican proposal now i just wanted to briefly mention again the important areas where the patients bill of rights a democratic bill of rights really provides for a very good protection for patients once again and most importantly the democratic patients bill of rights allows doctors and patients rather than insurance company bureaucrats to make medical decisions using the principles of good medicine in addition it would first guarantee access to needed health care specialists the democratic bill provides access to emergency room services when and where the need arises the democratic bill provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped the democrats patients bill of rights gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process and the democratic patients bill of rights assures that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options and not be gagged because the insurance company says that you cannot talk about something that is not covered the patients bill of rights would also assure that women have direct access to ob gyn and finally and almost as important really as the medical necessity issue is that the democrats patients bill of rights provides an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions i sound very partisan this evening and i do not mean to suggest that there are not republican members on the other side of the aisle that are supportive of the patients bill of rights or the types of protections that i think that are needed in a comprehensive hmo reform bill i know that there are members on the other side that would like to see these types of protections provided under the law but the bottom line is that the republican leadership which is in charge of the house keeps producing legislation or keeps proposing legislation both in the house and in the senate that does not adequately protect patients and i think it is very important that we not only move ahead in this session of congress and quickly on hmo reform but that we move ahead with an hmo reform that adequately protects patients rights that is

history i consistently voted against irresponsible spending bills and for legislation to balance the budget and bring our fiscal house back to order today were reaping the benefits of our fiscal restraint we are now in our third year of budget surpluses and unprecedented economic progress the united states is enjoying the longest economic expansion in history the lowest poverty rate in twenty years and the lowest unemployment rate since the 1970s whereas in 1992 we suffered under the weight of a 290 billion budget deficit today we are buoyed by a 211 billion surplus and yet it seems that our republican colleagues have forgotten the lessons we learned just eight short years ago and are spending the surpluses as fast as they come in last year the republicans tried to enact their tax cut agenda at a cost of 929 billion over 10 years this sweeping bill failed because it was obvious that such a large package shoved aside all other priorities and put the nations fiscal health in jeopardy this year republicans have devised a more clever political strategy of breaking up their tax agenda allowing them to focus attention on the same attractions of each part of their agenda while obscuring the total cost but the cost is the same so far this year republicans have pushed through tax cuts that would eat up 739 billion of the budget surpluses when you add this to other tax cuts and spending increases they vow to bring up the republicans will have spent 88 billion more than is available once social security and medicare are protected today congress is on its way to invading medicare as well while we are currently in an era of surpluses we must not forget that medicares fiscal future is troubled according to the most recent trustees report part a will begin running cash deficits again by 2010 totaling neariy 7 trillion by 2040 despite these looming deficits the republicans have introduced yet another tax cut that robs the medicare program of roughly 100 billion in dedicated revenues over the next ten years and 464 billion through 2024 the social security benefits tax relief act repeals a portion of the tax on social security benefits thereby eliminating a dedicated source of revenues to the medicare trust fund without this income medicare part a will go into the red again five years earlier than under current law the result will be a significant threat to the viability of the medicare program for future generations and an even greater squeeze on hospitals and other health care providers dependent upon medicare payments h r 4865 purports to replace the lost revenue to the medicare trust fund from the projected onbudget surplus however while the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund is guaranteed the budget surplus exists only in projections and faces many other competing demands furthermore the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund would be permanent while the projected budget surpluses are temporary once the projected surpluses run out the medicare trust fund will be left with a large hole unless a future congress is willing to raise taxes or cut other programs perhaps most egregious like other republican tax cuts h r 4865 only benefits the wealthiest americans the national council of senior citizens calls h r 4865 an irresponsible political gesture to upper income persons which will have severe consequences for the social security system and the solvency of the medicare part a trust fund the massive amount of general revenues that would be consumed by this bill will leave fewer resources extending the solvency of the medicare program and creating a medicare prescription drug benefit the democratic substitute amendment on the other hand provides the same tax relief as the republican bill but offers it to more seniors at about half the cost whereas the republican bill only benefits the wealthiest 20 percent of social security recipients the democratic substitute would provide tax relief to 95 percent of seniors rather than eliminating the tax for all seniors the democratic substitute keeps the tax in place for only the very wealthiestsingles earning more than 80 000 and couples earning more than 100 000 a year the democratic substitute is also more fiscally responsible unlike the republican bill the democratic substitute protects social security and medicare by conditioning the tax cut on a certification from the secretary of the treasury that the onbudget surplus is sufficient to replenish the lost tax revenue thus it cant go into effect in years in which there is not enough of an onbudget surplus to replace lost revenues we are at a historic fork in the road if we continue down the path of irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthy there will be nothing left for shoring up medicare and social security enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or paying down the public debt i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the democratic substitute and no on the underlying bill

talking about price gouging price gouging some of the most vulnerable members of our community our seniors americans widely support programs to ensure the health and welfare of older americans we have social security we have medicare as well as housing programs nutrition programs and programs that really protect our lowincome seniors seniors today have less fear of being taken advantage of because of consumer laws and senior abuse laws that protect them but there is one area where we clearly have failed and that is to ensure that prescription drugs are affordable affordable to the people who need them the most our seniors the latest surveys indicate that 86 percent of medicare beneficiaries take prescription drugs and that the elderly in the united states who make up only 12 percent of our population use onethird of the prescription drugs sold in this nation the need for prescription drugs to treat such diseases as arthritis diabetes high blood pressure heart disease is simply a fact of life for seniors or a fact of death a few years ago a survey of seniors reported that 13 percent of older americans had to choose between eating or buying medicine in sonoma and main counties the district i represent the two counties north of the golden gate bridge two individuals that i have come to know roy and ivera cobbs of sebastopol have had to make some very difficult decisions around their prescription drugs what thley decided was she would take her prescription drugs and he would not because they could not afford both that is not the way we are supposed to be treating our seniors also in sonoma and matin county the area agencies on aging and green thumb have told me some other stories they tell me about cases where seniors just do not buy food because they have to have prescription drugs or they take part of their prescription every other day instead of every day or once a day instead of twice a day as prescribed by their doctors because they cannot afford to pay for the whole dosage and for the reason some seniors cannot pay for them keeps our seniors from having the best health care they can this reason i believe is solely on the shoulders of the nations largest drug companies because they engage in discriminatory pricing if you are a favored customer like an hmo like a large insurance company you pay less much less for prescription drugs but if you are an older person on medicare you pay a premium price for your drugs in the district i represent sonoma county seniors pay on the average of 145 percent more for the most commonly used drugs than favored customers pay for the same drugs for one drug they pay 242 percent more than favored customers i know this because i asked the minority staff of the committee on government reform to look into prescription drug pricing in sonoma and matin counties i released the results to that report to my community and its central conclusion can be summed up in the report subtitle drug companies profit at the expense of older americans as members can see by these charts for sonoma county alone the study looked into five commonly used prescription drugs charted their price at local pharmacies and compared those prices to what the federal government pays for the same drugs the federal negotiated price is nearly the same you must know as that charged to favored private customers large insurance companies and hmos senior citizens and other individuals who pay for their own drugs pay more than twice as much for these drugs than do the drug companies most favored customers for some drugs listed in the report the price is even more outrageous synthroid for example a hormone treatment costs sonoma county seniors 1 738 percent more than it cost the manufacturers favored customers by looking at these charts we can see that for medicare patients those who need the cholesterol drug zocor their costs are significantly greater than the favored customers this comes out to 115 for medicare patients and 34 for the favored customers that is 231 percent different the difference is not in price because the hmos the large insurance companies and government buyers are able to negotiate and buy in bulk the difference is because they are charging seniors to make up the difference for what they cut for their most favored customers"], [0.001048445701599121, 0.9989515542984009, 1, "i thank

weeks unveiling of my republican colleagues new budget proved to be more of the same all bad ideas despite predictions of medicare and social security catastrophes looming on the horizon the republican budget does nothing to extend the life of either social security or medicare for even one day but it still manages to siphon 775 billion into tax cuts for the richest americans instead of investing in education health care to prepare this country for the next century like nero the republican budget fiddles while social security and medicare burn the chief actuary of the social security administration has said this budget will have virtually no effect on the date that social security becomes insolvent it will just make sure that it goes broke on schedule that is not me speaking that is the chief actuary of the social security administration in contrast the democratic budget has a lock box which will protect social security until the year 2050 and protect medicare until the year 2020 my republican colleagues propose a plan that is less secure than the democrats and treasury secretary rubin recommended that the president of the united states veto it because in reality the republican lock box is more of an open till the differences do not stop there the democratic budget reduces the debt more than the republican budget every year that it is in effect the democratic

their lives for this country they deserve the very best health care the best services we can give them but my republican colleagues will not allow a vote will not even allow a vote on the clement veterans amendment the democratic budget provides more for defense spending over the long run than the republican budget because in the later years my republican colleagues had to choose between defense spending and tax cuts what do my colleagues think mr speaker they chose the tax cuts meanwhile the democratic budget still manages to provide some balanced tax cuts and keep our economy from slipping back into deficit the republican budget on the other hand will create a whole new deficit by the year 2014 the democratic budget does more to reduce class size and modernize our schools than the republican budget which will cut spending for head start cut spending for pell grants and cut money for work study the democratic budget protects important programs like wic which the republican budget cuts by so much that 1 2 million women infants and children will lose their benefits next year 16 400 of them live in my home state of massachusetts the wic program provides essential nutrition and education during the early years of the childrens development in order to make sure that they start school ready to learn if we do not give them good nutrition when they are very young we lose our chance forever some of my democratic colleagues tried to make sure that we got that chance but this rule does not make in order the defazio amendment on the progressive budget the clement amendment on the veterans budget or the mink amendment on education this rule does make in order the shadeggcoburn amendment which some people are equating with president clintons budget they say it reflects some cbo comparison i want to make something perfectly clear the shadeggcoburn amendment looks as much like president clintons budget as i look like gwyneth paltrow looking at this budget we would think that my republican colleagues have very sharp memories when it comes to bad habits that gave us the budget deficits in the 1980s and the tripling of our national debt now that our budget finally is in the black we should be very very careful about repeating those mistakes so i urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question if the previous question is defeated we will make in order the clement

of texas and the united states suffered a great loss with the passing of our former colleague henry b gonzalez last week there is no question that henry b gonzalez in his service on the san antonio city council in the texas state senate and as a member of this body including the pinnacle of being the chair of the house committee on banking housing and urban affairs did more for the people he represented than probably most members who have served in this body but more than that henry was a trail blazer for the hispanic population of texas and the united states and he was a trail blazer and a leader for american consumers as well there is not a piece of legislation dealing with consumer rights financial issues or housing issues that was not greatly influenced or does not bear the mark of henry b gonzalez that occurred over the last 30 years henry b gonzalez was the father of the community reinvestment act he was the father of much of the financial services reform that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s and he clearly was the father of the various laws dealing with public housing and housing assistance that were adopted by this body in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s henry b gonzalez was always true to his word he always rose to the occasion and conquered whatever task was put before him as my colleague from ft worth has mentioned there were some who questioned whether or not he would be able to rise to the occasion as chair of the house committee on banking and there were some who questioned whether or not he would be able to go beyond issues related to consumer rights and community reinvestment and housing issues to deal with the tough intricate issues of financial regulation particularly in the midst of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and yet henry b gonzalez was the person who was able to show the leadership to drive a force through the middle to pass the firrea and fidicia legislation and pass other legislation which brought this country out of its worst banking crisis since the great depression so i do not think there is any question that henry b gonzalez did what he was asked and served with great distinction for the people of the 20th district of texas and the united states i would just close by saying this i had the honor of serving with henry b gonzalez in two ways one as a member and also as staff and i can remember while in graduate school as a young staffer on the hill long before the conservative opportunity society and members really knew what special orders were about it was henry b gonzalez who came to the floor every day and closed the house and would speak extemporaneously for 60 minutes about whatever issue he happened to be interested in drawing back on his extensive knowledge of history and captivating the audience that was there the new cspan audience that was out there later as a member of the house committee on banking when henry was th8 most senior member with all due respect to the chairman but still the most senior member on the committee and i the most junior member on the committee he brought me along and i will never forget as the chairman of the committee knows this well henry b gonzalez who built his career who has the longest record for a filibuster in the texas state senate fighting the socalled states rights issues and the jim crow laws that at the end of his career it was henry b gonzalez and i who were fighting for states rights and the rights of texas to determine its home equity laws we were not successful that day in the house committee on banking as the chairman will remember but in the end henry prevailed and the issue went back to the state of texas it was a great honor and privilege to serve with henry b gonzalez he will long be remembered not just in the 20th

"i want to thank the gentlewoman for what she said and for being a leader on all of the issues of health care reform but particularly on the issue of the patients bill of rights and managed care reform the gentlewoman mentioned some of the piecemeal approaches that we are hearing from the republican leadership and i just wanted to remind my colleagues and maybe we could just spend a few minutes explaining why we are here tonight essentially the problem that we face as democrats is that the republican majority in the house has been unwilling to bring up the patients bill of rights and since we do not control the procedure either in committee or on the floor of the house we are forced essentially just to speak out and explain why it is unfair that the patients bill of rights has not been brought up here in the house of representatives obviously what we have tried to do from the beginning of this year is to have a hearing on the bill in committee which has not been allowed and then to mark it up and bring it to the floor when none of that was possible for the last 6 months we then se h5357 tried the discharge petition process where we come down to the floor and sign a petition the way our constituents petition us and basically the way the rules provide that if a majority of us sign a petition that the bill comes to the floor the patients bill of rights would come to the floor without going to committee that is of course difficult too because we have to get a majority and i believe because of the delegate status of the gentlewoman from the virgin islands she is not even allowed to sign the petition or maybe she can sign it but it does not mean anything that she signs it which i think is also unfortunate and should be changed but now that we have gotten a significant number of members to sign the petition i know we had over 180 before the july 4th break we are starting to see the republican leadership get a little restless and come up with other ideas about how to avoid a debate on this issue one of the things they did was to bring up a series of piecemeal bills that took little pieces of the patient protections that we have in the patients bill of rights and basically brought them up in committee and tried to get them out of committee fortunately there were a few i think two or three republicans who did not want to go along with that because as the gentlewoman said they wanted a comprehensive approach like the patients bill of rights so that has gotten bogged down i am not sure what the latest tactics are to deal with that piecemeal approach we do have some republicans that are joining us in the effort and feel that this really should be a bipartisan issue but unfortunately it has not been because the republican leadership continues to not allow the patients bill of rights to be brought up i just wanted if i could to again say that the problem with these piecemeal bills is essentially what i talked about before with the gentlewoman from california which is the two key points the fact that doctors and patients should make decisions about what kind of treatment or care they get and not the insurance company is absent in those piecemeal bills and of course there is no real enforcement there is no real opportunity to go outside the hmo to make an appeal there is no opportunity to sue in a court of law if someone is seriously damaged so i think it is important that we keep raising this issue and even though we do have the other body now bringing up the issue of hmo reform it is not at all clear whether or not we are going to really see action on the patients bill of rights so we will have to wait and see what develops in that regard"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9984105825424194, 0.9984105825424194, 0, "tonight cleveland

be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now i am happy to yield back to the gentleman from colorado"], [0.9981747147394344, 0.001825285260565579, 1,

that are wrong we ought to apologize wen ho lee has been in the news a lot recently many members of congress have been justly critical of the irreparable damage that has been done to his reputation no

congress have repeatedly made sensational public allegations against individual american citizens many of these initial allegations have received widespread coverage in the media further investigation however often has shown that the allegations are unsupported by the facts and when the facts eventually do emerge the news media inevitably gives little ittention to the truth and the public record is rarely corrected let me give you an example in june 1997 former representative gerald solomon the chairman of the house rules committee claimed he had evidence from a government source that john huang the former commerce department official and democratic national committee fundraiser had coinmitted economic espionage and breached our national security this allegation of espionage was very serious it amounted to a claim of treason the most serious accusation that can be brought against an american it was reported on national television and in newspapers across the country but it turns out that that allegation was based on nothing more than gossip at a reception when the fbi interviewed mr solomon about this allegation he told the fbi that he was told by a senate staffer at a capitol hill

out over time this is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting them in two they are asking if they can get half a prescription filled because they simply cant afford it we need to change that"],

tribute to the holy fathers remarkable contributions to humanity pope john paul ii has touched the lives of many and continues to be a powerful and enduring force in fostering peace among nations and in reconciling the three great religious faiths of the children of abraham christianity judaism and islam i am honored to stand before this house today joining catholics from my district the unitedstates the rest of the world and people of all faiths in recognizing this remarkable mans monumental contributions to humanity karol joseph wojtyla was born 80 years ago in an industrial town near cracow in poland in fact the holy father just celebrated his 80th birthday this past thursday may 18th during which he celebrated mass ate lobster with senior clergy in the vatican and sang songs with polish compatriots as a teenager during the second world war karol wojtyla experienced firsthand the horrors of nazism the holocaust and soon thereafter communist totalitarianism i have carried with me the history culture experience and language of poland said the pope once having lived in a country that had to fight for its existence in the face of the aggressions of its neighbors i have understood what exploitation is i put myself immediately on the side of the poor the disinherited the oppressed the marginalized and the defenseless said the pope after considering a career as an actor and even petitioning three times to become a catholic monk he was persuaded by the thenarchbishop of cracowwho recognized his charisma oratorical talents and potential to help people directlyto pursue the priesthood he was ordained as a catholic priest in 1946 became archbishop of cracow in 1958 cardinal in 1967 and was elected pope by the vaticans college of cardinals in 1978 at the age of 58the first nonitalian pope since the holy pontiff by his own description is a moral leader who believes in the sanctity of the human being over the years he has denounced the excesses and affronts to human dignity of the two major competing social systems of the 20th century communism and capitalism he has condemned the atheistic and dehumanizing forces of communism which he experienced in poland and he has denounced the more unsavory aspects of modem capitalism such as greed abject poverty selfishness and secular atheism according to his spokesman the holy pontiffs goal is to establish a mode of christian thinking to serve as a meaningful alternative to the humanist philosophies of the 20th century such as marxism and postmodernism his moral philosophy and its impact on world affairs eamed him the honor of time magazine man of the year of 1994 which described him as the most tireless moral voice of a secular age pope john paul iis moral philosophy has brought much needed attention to the plight of the worlds poor in this vein the pope has called for substantial reduction or outright cancellation of the international debt that seriously threatens the future of many of the poorest nations inspired in part by the popes example we are proud to have contributed to the enactment of international debt relief legislation last year which was facilitated by the jubilee 2000 movementthrough which the holy father has nurtured meaningful ecumenical cooperation pope john paul ii has already left us a substantial body of written work that will nourish future generations with the wisdom and benevolence of this moral philosophy in fact his writings fill nearly 150 volumes through his encyclicals homilies letters and other writings this pope of letters has inspired the world to embrace universal principles of human dignity and human rights in 1994 his popular volume of philosophical and moral ruminations crossing the threshold of hope became an immediate bestseller in 12 countries the most traveled pope in history pope john paul ii has brought his message of peace and reconciliation to 117 countries in his most recent visit to israel for example the holy father prayed at the western wall one of judaisms holiest sites his prayer an unprecedented act of contrition on behalf of catholic christians read as follows we are deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer and asking your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the covenant and how can we forget his groundbreaking trip to cuba in 1998 on that papal visit he condemned the dehumanizing and immoral aspects of both cuban communism and the outdatedand senselessunitedstates trade embargo as customary his words echoed in the farthest corners of the world pope john paul ii understands one of the most fundamental christian principles that has become a hallmark for fostering reconciliation forgiveness in one of the most remarkable acts of forgiveness ever witnessed publicly the holy father confronted the man that attempted to assassinate him and forgave him for his grave sin the holy fathers acts of compassion stem from his inherently benevolent nature his compassion charisma and moral authority are celebrated by leaders of other faiths for instance the dalai lama the spiritual leader of the worlds buddhists has said of the pope he really has a will and a determination to help humanity through spirituality that is marvelous that is good i know how difficult it is for leaders on these issues rev billy graham a spiritual adviser to many unitedstates presidents has also said about the pope hell go down in history as the greatest of our modern popes hes been the strong conscience of the whole christian world when pope john paul speaks whether to those gathered at st peters square at the vatican or in a mass delivered in the backwaters of cuba the world listens the world listens because he is the most powerful moral force in our lifetimes an apostle for social justice a champion of the poor and a harbinger of peace i urge the congress to move swiftly on this
