at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton and we will talk to her many many times"], [0.003036320209503174, 0.9969636797904968, 1, "from the committe on rules submitted a privileged report

in which to expand their lending revise and extend their remarks on the the home loan bank act was subject of this special order signed by president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached

2d edition oxford university press 1985 parker was a prominent and distinguished republican leader in north carolina for many years and an outstanding jurist who fell victim to the sustained opposition of the american federation of labor and the national association for the advancement of colored people parker was rejected by the senate 41 to 39 but abrahams commentary explains the irony of the rejection the n a a c p contended that the nomifnee was generally opposed to black partici pation in politics and especially to black suffrage thus walter white of the n a a c p leadership pointed out that judge parker while stumping north carolina as a gubernatbrial candidate in 1920 had indeed made an unfortunate remark the participation of the negro in politics is a source of evil

provision reappropriating unexpended balances of appropriations i section 4 b of the foley substitute reappropriates 16 million in unobligated dod funds to the president to assist the contras through june 30 section 5 a of the substitute reappropriates 4 million a month from the same unobligated dod funds to aid to assist the contras through december 31 1988 if a ceasefire is still in effect section 10 of the substitute transfer to aid 14 6 million in the same unobligated dod funds to aid to provide medical care to children who are victims of the conflict in nicaragua the substitute clearly reappropriates unexpended balances in violation of clause 6 of rule xxi the question remains however is this a general appropriations bill to which the amendment is being offered the precedents indicate that and i quote from 4 hinds precedents section 35663568 an appropriation bill covering several subjects may fairly be considered a general appropriation bill within the privilege conferred by the rule referrlng to what is now clause 4 a of rule 11 which confers on the appropriations committee the privilege to report at any time on general appropriations bills now it is true that the precedents indicate at section 835 of the house rules and manual that a general appropriations bill is not and i quote a joint resolution providing an appropriation for a single government agency and permitting a transfer of a portion of those funds to another agency nor a joint resolution transferring funds already appropriated from one specific agency to another march 6 1980 pp 67167 however in this instance we are not dealing with the mere transfer of funds from one agency to another agency for a single purpose we are dealing with the transfer of funds from the department of defense to both the office of the president and to the agency for international developmenttwo diverse agencies for two distinctive purposes aiding the contras and providing medical relief for noncombatant children while it might be argued that this is for the single purpose of providing assistance and support for peace democracy and reconciliation in central america as the title of the substitute indicates this cannot qualify as a single purpose according to the precedents i cite here procedure in the house 97th congress chapter 25 section 1 2 under the heading general appropriations bills privileged status the precedent reads and i quote the committee on appropriations filed as privileged a joint resolution making supplemental appropriations to two diverse departments for the balance of the fiscal year an examination of the congressional record of the date cited april 22 1975 at pages 1192526 reveals that the resolution in question house joint resolution 407 was in the words of its title a joint resolution making emergency supplemental appropriations for assistance to the republic of south vietnam for the fiscal year ending june 30 1975 and for other purposes specifically the joint resolution appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated 165 million to the department of defense for military assistance to the south vietnamese forces and 165 million to the president for indochina postwar reconstruction assistance in short the earlier precedent is clearly analogous to the present case in which unobligated appropriations are being transferred to two diverse agencies for two distinct forms of assistance in the same country in the former case it was military assistance and reconstruction assistance for vietnam in the present case it is humanitarian assistance for military forces and medical assistance for children in nicaragua had the 1975 joint resolution not been considered a general appropriation bill it could not have been filed as privileged as it was that precedent affirms that a dual purpose bill like this is a general appropriations bill it might be argued that this does not qualify as a general appropriation bill because it also includes legislative and authorizing language but there is no precedent to disqualify this on those grounds our appropriations committee reports numerous legislative provisions in each of its 13 regular appropriations bills so that argument can hardly be used to prove this is not a general appropriations measure however the distinction might be made that had this measure been introduced rather than simply called up as permitted by the rule it would have been referred to several committees as similar measures have been in the past whereas if a regular appropriation bill would be referred exclusively to the appropriations committee under house rules in other words that this is really a hybrid billhalf authorization and half appropriation but such an argument is irrelevant precisely because this has not been introduced and referred the legislative history of clause 6 indicates that it was another protection against unauthorized appropriations because this has not been introduced and referred to the appropriate committee it is all the more important that the clause 6 of rule xxi be available for use to prevent this reappropriation for new purposes without committee scrutiny and keep in mind that clause 6 differs from clause 2 clause 2 of rule xxi applies only to reported appropriations measures clause 6 on the other hand prohibits any general appropriation bill or amendment thereto from being received or considered obviously this anticipates the possibility that a general appropriation bill like this could be received or considered without being reported in conclusion clause 6 deals with one of our most important powers under the constitution the power of the purse we cannot apply a loose interpretation to those purse strings and hope to responsibly manage them i urge that the point of order be sustained 1615"]], "top_unsure": [[6.866455078125e-05, 0.49993133544921875, 0, "i move to strike the last
