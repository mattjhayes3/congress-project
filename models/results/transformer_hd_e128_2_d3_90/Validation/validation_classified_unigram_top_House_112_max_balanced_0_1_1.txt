again by itself is just a huge statement in terms of the challenges that families middle class families and working families are facing today in terms of trying to deal with the cost of higher education the value of a higher education degree or posthigh school degree which is sometimes debated in the media still i believe is indisputable and the statistics certainly demonstrate that at a time when our national unemployment rate is 8 3 percent if you drill down deeper youll learn that for those with less than a high school degree the unemployment rate is 16 5 percent those with a high school degree its 10 7 percent those with some college is 8 5 percent and those with a bachelors degree or higher is 4 5 percent so the stakes could not be higher for young people all across our country that we must deal with the mounting cost of higher education and provide mechanisms for them and their families to actually finance it and pay for it in 2007 the democraticcontrolled congress passed the college cost reduction act which was a terrific measure that cut the interest rates for the stafford student loan program the federally subsidized student loan program which provided some stability and affordability for middle class families from 6 8 percent down to 3 4 percent in addition we unfroze the pell grant program which is the workhorse of paying for college education all of it paid for by eliminating wasteful subsidies to banks that measure has a sunset this july the interest rate reduction of the college cost reduction act will in fact expire on july 1 unless congress acts president obama in his state of the union address a few nights ago raised this issue before all of us in the house and senate when he said when kids do graduate the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college at a time when americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in july shortly after his address myself and congressman peters from michigan introduced h r 3826 which is a measure that would extend the 3 4 percent the lower interest rates on the stafford student loan program and in just a few days we have accumulated 55 cosponsors to this measure again the math is crystal clear if we do not act if we do not maintain those interest rates at 3 4 percent if congress does nothing the unitedstates public interest research group has calculated that for those students who take out the maximum 23 000 in subsidized student loans their interest payments will increase by 5 200 over a 10year repayment period and 11 300 over a 20year repayment period now if you told middle class families that if congress doesnt act on a measure like this your outofpocket costs are going to go up 5 200 for taxes there would be a huge hue and cry about the fact that congress must not let that happen well thats exactly the same situation we face today with the stafford student loan program again

undergraduate has almost a perfect 4 0 grade average very motivated to go into the health care field and he has already accumulated 100 000 in student loan debt we as a nation must address this

fallen to number 12 according to the national college board and the biggest reason that students are not finishing college is because of affordability and cost again the president laid out the challenge to the congress in his state of the union address we must not allow stafford student loan interest rates to double on july 1 1l 1010 we should pass h r 3826 we should get that to the

of president kennedy back in 1960 when he spoke to the university of michigan and encouraged those students to volunteer to help america abroad finally in 1961 he started the peace corps since then over 200 000 americans mainly young people mainly females have volunteered to go around the world representing the united states it is very hard work being a peace corps volunteer they deal with issues that most americans never deal with just simple basic necessities such as of electricity and water and matters such as that they do without or they are difficult to find in the remote areas where they are because they are helping other people that dont have those things we have in the united states generally they work alone when they are in foreign countries but all is not well with the

to mention just one of those persons that i know personally i have got to know jess smochek since this crime against her has occurred she joined the peace corps in 2004 on her first day as a peace corps volunteer in bangladesh a group of men started sexually groping her as she was walking to the house that she was to live in but no one in the peace corps did anything about this assault she told the peace corps staff over and over again that she felt unsafe in bangladesh and the situation she was in but the peace corps didnt do anything months later she came in contact with the same men who then kidnapped her they beat her they sexually assaulted her but they werent through they abandoned her and threw her in an alley somewhere in bangladesh and no one did anything according to jess the peace corps did everything they could to cover this up because they seemed to be more worried about americas relationship with bangladesh than they were about this american volunteer that was assaulted a victim of crime jess says that the peace corps not only didnt do anything they blamed her for the conduct of others they blamed her for being a sexual assault victim a rape victim is never to be blamed for the crime that is committed against her it is the fault of the criminal offender whether it occurs in the united states or abroad we need to understand that these precious people who go overseas and represent us somewhere in the world when a crime is committed against them we need to take their side we need to be supportive of those individuals and we dont assume they did anything wrong because they did not do anything wrong when they became a victim of crime they were just victims of crime and the person that should be held accountable is the criminal and not to blame the victim rape is never the fault of the victim it is always the fault of the perpetrator but jess got no satisfaction from the peace corps no one did anything when she got home she was told to tell other people that she was coming back to the united states for medical reasons to have her wisdom teeth pulled not for the sexual assault that was committed against her this was jesss case a few
