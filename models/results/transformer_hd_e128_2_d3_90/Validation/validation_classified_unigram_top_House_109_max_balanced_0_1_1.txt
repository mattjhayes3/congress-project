billion 618 billion precisely from 38 billion to 618 billion by any stretch of the imagination it is hard to argue that our trade policy is working and that is why the opposition has been bipartisan to cafta to the central american free labor the central american free trade agreement that is why the opposition has been bipartisan that is why the opposition has been overwhelming last month 2 dozen democrats and republicans in congress joined more than 150 business groups and labor organizations sending the message vote no on this central american free trade agreement last week more than 400 union workers and members of congress gathered in front of the unitedstates capitol again delivering that message vote no on the central american free trade agreement now those of us opposed to cafta which clearly is a majority in this congress or we already would have voted on it those of us opposed to cafta say we are not opposed to trade we want to see fair trade agreements instead of free trade agreements because we know what free trade agreements do we know what this trade deficit does to our country it means according to the first president bush according to his economists it means literally 12 000 lost jobs per 1 billion of trade deflcft that means a million lost jobs it means more than that a million lost manufacturing jobs in this country in my state alone we have lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs not entirely because of trade agreements but that is a big component of it so we know what these trade agreements do to individuals when they lose their jobs what it does to family members when they lose their jobs what it does to communities when a community has a plant closing what it does to the school districts and the schools as they h3336 co lose funding because these workers have lost their jobs and because this plant has closed what it does to our country as a whole when we have this kind of trade deficit we understand that that is why those of us opposed to the central american free trade agreement want to throw out this dysfunctional cousin of nafta and want to negotiate a trade agreement that will lift workers up in central america while promoting prosperity here at home there is no reason that our trade agreements need to look like this need to have a result like this instead congress can move forward in passing a fair trade agreement the

on the central american free trade agreement by the end of may now if you will look at this chart you will see that the end of may happens to be the 1year anniversary of when cafta was sent to

"19 years ago i came to congress to fight aids a disease that has taken nearly 18 000 lives in my city of san francisco alone we have lost friends family and loved ones but we have not lost our will to fight this terrible disease this year we mark the 25th anniversary of the first diagnosis of aidsa stark reminder that this epidemic is still among us ahd that our work is not done yet as we grieve for those we have lost we are filled with hope a~s we see the strength of those who are fighting and living full lives with hiv and aids this would not be possible without the help of the federal government through initiatives such as the ryan white care act the act has been instrumental in our fight to defeat aids it has greatly improved the quality and availability of health care services for people living with and affected by hiv and aids i was proud to be a part of the creation of the ryan white care act unfortunately i must rise in opposition to this reauthorization there are a number of good provisions in this bill including the recognition of emerging communities and the use of actual living aids counts rather than estimated living aids cases that change will benefit many communities including my constituents in san francisco however when it comes to meeting the needs of people living with aids our mantra should be the same as the physicians who care for all patients first do no harm the primary problem with this legislation is that it fails to provide adequate funding for the treatment of hiv aids patients had this administration and the republicancontrolled congress made a priority of funding the ryan white program over the last several years i would be standing here in strong sup port of this bill but they have not and i cannot support this bill yet funding in this bill simply wont be able to meet the current demand for hiv aids care in the united states under this reauthorization san francisco with the highest per capita caseload of people living with aids in the country stands to lose almost 30 million over the next 5 years that is a far cry from the bipartisan consensus we were able to achieve on this issue between 1993 and 2001 during that time fundingadjusted for both inflation and caseload growthunder the ryan care act increased by 70 percent since 2001 funding has declined by 35 percent the problem is not that one part of the country gets too much money and some other parts of the country are left behind instead peoplesuffering from this diseaseand those caring for themare being forced to compete for pieces of an evershrinking pie if funding for this act had simply kept pace with the number of people with aids and inflation my city and all other cities and states would be getting increases in funding instead of grappling with how they can stretchand where they will have to sacrificein meeting the growing demand for services in fact the impact of the cuts will be compounded because in san francisco these funds form the basis for matching funds from the city due in no small part to this federal state and local investment more people are living with hiv and aids now than dying from it that is remarkable as the epicenter of the epidemic san francisco has experienced terrible loss of lifebut from that loss my city has created a standard of care that has been a model for the nation but our problem has not gone away there are more people living with aids in the san franciscos area than at any point in the epidemics history this legislation has farreaching implications for the stability of hiv aids funding in our state and cities the programs funded by the ryan white care act have literally been lifesavers for people who live with hiv aids it has provided critical support to the cities that have been the center of the epidemic and to states that have been funding critical drug and support programs to treat the disease this cut in funding to san francisco means a loss in services for patients receiving primary medical care a lack of access to counseling support outreach services transitional and emergency housing and emergency payments for health care costs where do these people go what do we tell them when their ability to receive support to fight hiv aids is cut off in prior reauthorizations of the ryan white care act the changes that have been made were made at the margins in order to deal with emerging problems and developments these changes did not however disrupt an initiative that was working unlike those past reauthorizations this bill would have a drastic destabilizing effect on many of the hardesthit areas of the country including california a basic goal of this reauthorization must be to ensure that the actions we take do not destabilize systems already in place unfortunately the bill fails to meet this goal and jeopardizes the critical funding of areas throughout the country in general and the state and cities of california in particular in addition the bill prematurely incorporates hiv reporting into the allocation formula eliminates the hold harmless provision just when san francisco and california need it the most and allows the administration to devise and implement a whole new funding formula without congressional approval it is for these reasons i must oppose this bill and i will submit the entirety of my statement for the record the second major problem with this legislation is that there is simply no way to incorporate data on hiv cases into the funding formula on a consistent and comparable basis across jurisdictions the 2000 reauthorization of the act included a requirement that hiv cases be incorporated into the funding distribution by no later than 2007 at that time hiv reporting systems were in various stages of development across the country although some states and cities had been reporting hiv cases by name since 1985 others had yet to implement an hivreporting system at all given this landscape the drafters understood the need to provide sufficient time to allow states and cities to begin collecting hiv cases at the time they believed seven years to be adequate for such a transition as it turns out it was not as hiv reporting systems were developed variations among these systems across jurisdictions emerged some areas reported hiv by the individuals name along with other identifying information others like california as a means of protecting the individuals confidentiality opted not to report the persons name at all and instead included only a unique code identifying the individual the 2000 reauthorization of the ryan white act did not specify which type of reporting system jurisdictions were required to use and nothing in the law prohibited this kind of variation so long as the secretary found that the data on hiv cases was sufficiently accurate and reliable jurisdictions were free to report cases by name or by code thus whether an area began collecting hiv by name or by code they were on equally solid ground under the law it was not until december 2005 that cdc first gave a clear indication that it would deem only cases reported by name to be sufficiently accurate and reliable in a letter to all codebased states cdc set forth its strong recommendation that those states convert their systems to namesbasedit did not however establish any sort of legal requirement at that point 13 states used some form of a codebased reporting system in response to cdcs announcement almost all codebased states began the process of converting their hiv reporting systems to namesbased systems the reported bill would rely exclusively on namesbased hiv and aids cases in making funding allocations starting in fiscal year 2011 in order to meet this deadline and have all of their namesbased hiv cases counted for funding purposes codebased jurisdictions will be required to have completely converted to namesbased systems in less than 3 years for large and diverse codebased states with several very large cities like california this is simply not enough time to make this change california essentially has to start from scratch in its codebased system california currently has approximately 40 000 cases of hiv nonaids under california law these cases cannot simply be retallied under the new namesbased system in order to incorporate these cases into the new system the state must contact each of these 40 000 individuals and ask them to come in to a testing site to be retested some of these individuals are homeless some are drugabusers many dont speak english when personnel and resources are already strained california will simply not be able to get all of these individuals entered into the namesbased system in 3 years the experience of other large codebased systems provides a sense of the difficulty of this task new york for example converted to a namesbased system in 2000 and is now considered by cdc to be mature however it is widely acknowledged that new yorks current namesbased hiv count severely undercounts the true burden of hiv in the state simply because it has not had enough time to find and report all of its hiv cases i cannot support legislation that would disadvantage my state and city and take large amounts of dollars away simply because the data system is incomplete the number of persons with hiv and with need for services remains they should not lose needed services because of an unrealistic data requirement under the language of the proposal it is also unclear on what basis the funds will be allocated gao and the state of california both of which have modeled the bill have quite different case counts for the same state and city the proposed language says codebased numbers are used to determine funding allocations hrsa numbers used by gao in their estimates are not codebased numbers those numbers purport to show neednot any scientific way of counting cases and a method which surely varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction depending on how much the grantee estimated what assurance is there that the gao numbers will be used to allocate funds in fiscal year 2007 and the out years this does not pass the test of good govemment under the proposed language the case count used in 2010 and 2011 in making the allocation to san francisco will be substantially less than the actual number of hiv positive individuals who currently live in san francisco that simply is unfair and is not good policy because hiv reporting systems across the country remain in a state of flux it is critical that this reauthorization protect against severe losses in funding whenthe bill requires that the funding be based on hiv cases the most effective way to accomplish this protection is to incorporate a holdharmless provision for the entire life of the bill unfortunately the current bill protects a jurisdictions funding for only the first 3 years this is not enough california faces the most drastic cuts at the very time the hold harmless under the bill comes to an end by californias estimates the state stands to lose nearly 25 percent of its total ryan white care act funding during the 5th year of the bill alone our state simply cannot sustain these kinds of losses in year 5 when transition to namesbased reporting becomes mandatory california and all other jurisdictions moving to namesbased reporting will lose substantially the amount of loss is difficult to ascertain because it will depend entirely upon how quickly california and other jurisdictions can transition to namesbased reporting the elimination of the hold harmless will have a devastating impact on the provision of hiv aids services in san francisco the hold harfrnless was adopted to protect the epicenters of this disease from experiencing drastic reductions in care funding from year to year that would disrupt the systems of care in place and eliminating it now would cause this very consequence as you may know the city of san francisco consistently has invested local funds into the fight against this disease and the care of those living with hiv aids san francisco has been conscientiously preparing to absorb cuts as a result of the eventual loss of the hold harmless but the more than onethird cut in funding proposed is punitive and will eliminate critical care for thousands of people living with hiv aids finally i cannot support the bills inclusion of the socalled severity of need index soni the bill requires the secretary to develop a soni to measure the relative needs of individuals living with hiv aids but fails to specify the factors that should be incorporated into this index leaving it entirely up to the secretary further the bill then permits the secretary to completely discard the current funding formula and distribute funding on the basis of this soni beginning as early as fy 2011 without congressional action this is unacceptable congressnot the administrationshould be solely responsible for making such a drastic shift in the way funds are distributed under the act"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "2 000 american troops have now lost their lives in iraq it is time to end this war let us bring our troops home and restore unitedstates credibility in the world community this war was based on fiction that is a fact that is no longer disputed there were no weapons of mass destruction and no ties to al qaeda there was no imminent threat this administration with the acquiescence of congress rushed into a war that according to secretary of state colin powells former chief of staff lawrence wilkerson has made our country more vulnerable not less to future crisis the bush administration has stubbornly refused to reassess the situation they have refused to listen to the words of military and diplomatic leaders who have warned that a continuing unitedstates presence in iraq will not calm the violence or lead to a more stable iraq the unitedstates presence in iraq is now a major part of the problem al qaeda is in iraq today because we are there the abuse and torture by unitedstates forces of detainees at abu ghraib prison and the near 3year occupation by us troops have made us an unpopular force in iraq even among those who originally supported the unitedstates invasion we have spent over 300 billion on the war with no end in sight it is estimated that another 2 years of war will boost that amount to 1 trillion our military is stretched to the limit with much of the burden falling on our guard and reserves there are some politicians in washington who say that no matter what we must stay the course i strongly disagree it is worth pointing out that it is not congressmen senators or members of the bush administration whose lives are on the line in battle it takes no courage for anybody in washington to wave the american flag and send more troops we owe our brave fighting men and women so much more washington made a mistake in going to war it is time for politicians to admit that mistake and fix it before any more lives are lost in vietnam we didnt have the lesson of vietnam to guide us says david halberstam who won a pulitzer prize for his coverage of that war he goes on to say in iraq we did have those lessons the tragedy is that we didnt pay any attention to them mr speaker we have now sacrificed the lives of 2 000 members of our armed forces

troops it will allow us to support transitional security provided by other countries including international organizations like nato and the united nations the bill will also allow for continued support for iraqi security forces and international forces in iraq as well as funding for reconstruction efforts this is not a cut and run strategy rather it is a way to support efforts that i believe can be more helpful in creating a more stable iraq but the bill makes clear no more unitedstates boots on the ground in iraq ultimately the future of iraq will depend on whether the various factions in the country genuinely and truly want to live with each other no constitution or election can fully determine that outcome this war has cost us dearly in terms of human life and treasure at a time when we are shortchanging our veterans here at home our schools health care and even our homeland security it makes no sense to throw good money after bad in this quagmire in iraq sometimes great

structure to fix the flaws with the unsatisfactory there are a host of problems with the wto and the number of problems is only growing the wto completely lacks any degree of transparency hearings are closed to the pub lic and public transcripts are not released where in a very limited manner wto rules permit limited transparency by allowing the assistance and resources of private parties who h4316 are supportive of the unitedstates government position the administration has chosen not to utilize this allowance transparency is not the only problem contributing to the wtos failure to move rulesbased trade forward globally but it is the central factor allowing the wto and its bureaucrats to escape the scrutiny which would quickly eradicate other abuses in geneva through the lack of transparency the wto dispute settlement and appellate bodies are emboldened to disregard the proper standard of review in disputes involving trade laws for example in this way past wto panels have issued rogue decisions against the unitedstates with no basis or standing in the context of previously negotiated agreements this rampant judicial activism is rapidly undermining the support for the

"in the last few weeks once again there has been no shortage of a man named mr joe wilson on television who is mr joe wilson why would he want to use false claims to attack this bush administration mr joe wilson endorsed senator john kerry in october of 2003 according to media sources mr joe wilson contributed 2 000 to the kerry campaign in the same year the boston globe has reported that mr wilson spoke to the kerry campaign at least once a week during the campaign well he himself has even said that he advised the kerry campaign on foreign policy so now this kerry supporter and adviser is on television pointing fingers at the administration he despises now during my tenure as a judge credibility of witnesses could usually be judged by seeking to learn if the witness had a bias obviously this witness has quite a bias it has also been reported that he and his wife supported albert gore for president against george w bush in 2000 the motive for bias seems to deepen the press has reported mr joe wilson was in fact the last unitedstates diplomat to meet with saddam hussein in 1991 he was also the envoy sent to africa to investigate reports that the iraqi president had tried to buy nuclear material there was it possible he hated president bush so much that it got in the way of his ability to assess the facts and actions and motives of his old acquaintance mr saddam hussein perhaps his intentions were loyal to the security of the united states in 1991 but if that is the case while serving as an official envoy to niger as he claims it appears he brazenly spoke out publicly against our own administration the senate intelligence committee found that mr wilsons report rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to iraq actually bolstered the case for most intelligence analysis so now it appears that like his favorite former presidential candidate mr wilson is flipflopping the typically softspoken senator pat roberts chair of the senate se lect committee on intelligence was harsh in his condemnation time and again joe wilson told anyone who would listen that the president had lied to the american people that the vice president had lied and that he had debunked the claim that iraq was seeking uranium from africa not only did he not debunk the claim he actually give some intelligence analysts even more reason to believe that it may be true roberts went on to say that it was important for the intelligence committee to declare that much of what wilson said had no basis in fact contrary to what he has said publicly mr wilsons wife a cia employee did recommend him to serve as envoy in 2002 it appears obvious that neither mr wilson nor his wife had conducted themselves properly in the best interest of this country why would a former ambassador privately report inaccurate facts about iraqi officials potential dealings with business men in niger why would his wife float his name to serve as envoy on this trip if they wanted to stay out of the public eye i have come to know people after they retired from being covert agents of the government it seems that the best covert agents are the kind of people who go into a room and when you look around that room you do not notice them they blend in they keep their names off lists so they do not make contributions especially to political figures they keep a low profile they certainly avoid having their picture put in popular magazines it really appears that the wilsons disdain for this administration will likely go down as one of the greats in history but they have been so blinded to something we would call the truth some of our colleagues across the aisle and senate democrats down the hall have embraced this man on little credibility in efforts to harm this administration that is determined to protect us from evil men with evil motivations desiring to destroy our way of life their rhetoric is based on two news storiesboth of which appear to exonerate rove the facts are simple joe wilson said the vice president sent him to niger and that his report was shown to the vice president the senate select committee on intelligence confirmed that rove was right and wilson was wrong the vice president didnt send wilson anywhere karl rove then discouraged a reporter from writing a false story that was based on a false premise promulgated by a lying or blindly prejudiced mr joe wilson the main questions now on the matter should be what else has joe wilson lied about and why is anyone putting him on television perhaps if recommending a blindly prejudiced man to go to niger to do critical research for our country is any indication as to mr wilsons wifes judgment then maybe it is a good thing she has not been trying to be covert for several
