bloody war was fought earlier in this decade with the karabagh armenians successfully defending their homelands a ceasefire was accepted by both sides in 1994 but a political settlement has not been

fund the programs that do work i would like to say as i will speak later on my own time that i join with the gentleman in wanting to support these good programs that do work and i would be delighted to work with him and his successors in figuring out as i ask every time in every hearing how do we legislate excellence but the answer is not to cut back when there is so many people who need the education they need the retraining because not everyone is benefiting from this great economy so i am sure my colleagues on this side of the aisle would be delighted to work with the gentlemans successors to make sure that these programs are delivering that is the challenge to all of us we do not want to fund everything"], [0.00010582804679870605, 0.4998941719532013, 0, "i yield myself such
