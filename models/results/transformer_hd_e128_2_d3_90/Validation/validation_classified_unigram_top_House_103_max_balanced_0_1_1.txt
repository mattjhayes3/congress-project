directions first we hear people say how terrible it is we are going to divert all sorts of resources at the local level away from education then we have people on the other side who are trying their darndest to prevent us from authorizing which is exactly what we are trying to do with the socalled roberts amendment the money that is necessary to pay for this added cost which is a minimal minimal cost of people asking two more questions of all the other questions that they ask when a student has to register for class we just ask two more questions as far as i am concerned we have to be really up front right now about what we are talking about we are talking about in this language the roberts language an authorization of the money we just hear people on the floor saying that they are concerned that the local governments will have to spend that is what this is an authorization we also hear that we cannot for example by authorizing this money really be assured that the money is going to get there because it is not appropriated come on that means nothing in this bill has any meaning at all because we do rely on the appropriators to appropriate the money this is exactly where this kind of stand should be made this is exactly where the policy is made we are stating the policy we are making the authorization as i say the end cost is minimal even to the federal government i think the public when they are listening to this debate will understand we are being told you cannot do anything about the illegal immigration problem leave it to the immigration and naturalization service in my state we know by providing tens of thousands of dollars worth of benealts education health benefits housing benefits to illegal aliens what we have done is enticed a flood of illegal immigration from all over the world into california and it is breaking our bank again if members defeat my amendment and this amendment no one from california from the southwest should come back to this body and say we need money to help take care of the education or health needs of illegal immigrants because they have refused to permit us to set up a system where we can quantify the problem by the way leaving it up to immigration we know it has not worked in california we know it has not worked they can build a wall 10 feet high dig a trench 20 feet deep and if we are giving a package of benefits to people to come here illegally especially if it is aimed at helping their families and these are good and decent people we are not saying that the people who are coming here illegally whether it is from canada as was suggested in michigan or whether it is from mexico as many of the people from california are from mexico or from asia or from europe or from ireland these are not bad people coming here we just cannot afford to spend tens of millions hundreds of millions billions of dollars educating people from other countries who are here illegally the bottom line is when we hear the other side of this argument talking with all sorts of compassion about we cannot waste the money to even determine the problem the american people can understand what is going on the american people are going to see that what we are being told is we cannot do anything about a problem that is draining billions of dollars out of our system draining bihlions of dollars that should be going to provide education for our own kids meaning kids of legal residents and unitedstates citizens and giving this money to provide benefits for the children of illegal aliens that is not to say that we do not like these children or that they are bad people we have to care about our own people first now you can talk about all kinds of parliamentary maneuvers and things of why it cannot be done and use all of these words the people back home will just know that what is happening is an attempt to prevent at least a first step of coming to grips with this problem and that is we have got to take down the welcome sign that says if you can get across this border we are going to give you all kinds of benefits the same benefits package that any american has because we are inviting people to come and the immigration service that you are talking about you are h 1020 c saying let the immigration service do it i will tell members if we are providing this benefit they are never going to be able to do that job and you know they will never be able to do that job because we are giving people an incentive to break the law and come here i have supported legal immigration this is not an antiimmigrant bill this is an antiillegalalien move to try to stem this flow that is coming into our country and dissipating all of the funds that our people have saved up whether it is retirement or whether it is health care those people who come from our own country who have been here for a long time legal residents and unitedstates citizens and have contributed to the pot we are about them it is not that we are heartless for us to hear these words nazi germany the american people do not buy that kind of namecalling anymore they know it is a serious problem it deserves serious discussion and that is what this is all about"], [0.48631224036216736, 0.48631224036216736, 0, "i have to tell you this is a very special time to be participating with three of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and two on this side of the aisle to just be talking in simple terms about what is so essential the only reason why we deserve to be here is to do the right thing and i looked at what would happen if president clintons package had not passed and we just continued with what seems to be happening spending would have gone up 27 percent the national debt would go up 48 percent but with his package spending still goes up 23 percent and the national debt still will go up 40 percent and the administration and i say this not being critical of a democrat versus a republican i say this by the mere fact that the administration seems content with this 40percent increase in the national debt they have to be content with it because you have a good faith effort on the part of democrats and republicans to reduce this deficit more and i feel like this is a group that should be nurtured i think there should be press just doing everything they can to get this story out we need the american people to know that there is a bipartisan effort to cut this national deficit so we just do not keep adding to the national debt fortypercent increase in the national debt people say that is a smaller increase than in past years it is but it is on such a higher base the absolute increase in the national debt is 1 6 trillion in the next 5 years one reason i am not discouraged john when you do come to my officesometimes i am discouraged when you are not aroundbut you have given me a tremendous feeling of participating in something that is so important and you tim pfny i am as grateful as i can be for the both of you you have hielped lead a coalition of republicans and democrats if you were not there we would not have that kind of leadership we would all be frustrated in our own way we are a force a smaller force now but the reason i know we will gain in momentum is the problem is not going away that is the thing the problem is still there it is getting worse i had a meeting with a high administration official and since it was a oneonone meeting i will just say it was someone very high up i went to plead with that individual that they at least if they cannot support the pennykasich deficit reduction plan do not oppose it let the house argue on it because if the administration were just neutral this wouldpass what we are dealing with right now is a concerted effort to kill and destroy and stamp down on something that is starting to grow that could help the administration i consider my three colleagues on the democratic side the best friends the administration has and the sad thing is they do not seem to know it i think we are the best friends they could have because the problem does not go away i went to this high government official i said the national debt is 4 trillion now in 5 years it is going to be 6 trillion interest on the national debt is going up 27 percent in the next 5 years i am thinking that is money we could be spending on programs and we would not be jlt spending it on interest on the national debt more than 50 percent of our personal income goes to pay interest on the national debt it blows my mind when i am paying all my taxes and you are paying all your taxes 50 percent of it is going to pay interest on the national debt you know what i do when i have people come and complain about the pennykasich plan i say im going to spend as much time as you want to talk about it but first i want to tell you something i want to tell you that the national debt is going up 40 percent that it is going up 1 6 trillion and that we are going to be spending 3250 billion on interest on the national debt in the fifth year that could be going for other programs 3250 billion not 250 million 250 billion interest on the national debt that is why i am voting for the pennykasich plan and one of these groups said to me but wait a second there is 100 million of real good programs is here i said you are right there is s100 million of real good programs in fact there are even some more that i like but i am supposed to vote against the pennykasich plan because there is 100 million that i like and yet this cuts 390 billion so i am going to prevent us from cutting 90 billion because i want to save 100 or 3200 million i said is that not the reason why we are in this mess the one thing that i remember and i will conclude this way i remember when president jimmy carter talked about his daughter and he talking to his daughter about national defense and we all laughed but there are times you look at your daughter or your child or your children friends and you say when they ask me what did i do was i part of the problem or part of the solution i want to tell them i was part of the solution i will conclude by saying this i am absolutely convinced that whether or not pennykasich passes and i pray on bended knee it passes but if it does not this is the beginning because we are not going to go away we are not going to give up we are tough enough to deal with this these letters that we are getting from chairmen that are saying if you vote against us you are going to lose out you know they are one kind of view they are the old kind of view but they have no impact ultimately because the problem is not going away and we are going to have to deal with it now or later the only problem is if we wait later the medicine may almost kill the patient we have to act now as soon as possible i wanted to conclude and say praise the lord for members on both sides of the aisle you mr penny and mr finomrhut and mr andrews and your colleagues that are with you you are doing the right thing it is really an honor a privilege to be part of this with you you helped restore my faith that what we are doing means something"], [0.4868084490299225,

inclusiveness ingenuity and just downright innova tion that we have had had in this committee and it has been a very difficult one it has not been partisan at all there has been a suggestion that maybe it should be far more partisan but agriculture is not a issue here as a matter of fact when we realize that only 2 2 percent of the entire population of the united states is involved directly involved in agriculture production it is amazing to me that they all wound up here in congress because we have 435 absolute geniuses and absolute experts in agriculture because everybody is interested in agriculture no matter how far away we have grown as far as our basic roots are concerned we are all experts in this field weall know what programs we want to fund we know what could be cut and yet that is not the way the game is played because there are some discretionary and there are some mandatory facets to this whole question and some of these expenditures lie on one side or the other about the only thing that the committee on appropriations can do is take the discretionary side and deal with it as we must given the 602 b or the budget allocation we got from omb i think we did a credible job with a very difficult task and one that is not to the liking of anyone particularly those of us who have actually lived in the agricultural community and worked in agriculture and know that there is no margin or very little margin very little profit we despise the fact that in a national sense we are the target and the aim of a lot of discussion about the ridiculous situation we have in funding agriculture programs we are a target for cutting expenditures in government because no one believes that with our little rosy derrieres wellfed as they may be that there are so few people involved in really producing the kind of food that we take for granted today the quality of it and the rest because we do not need those agricultural pro grams any longer if it was not for those programs there would not be that kind of an agricultural program in the united states i also get just a little bit testy with the fact that we hear a lot of people from other businesses that say why can you not run agriculture like you run any other kind of business i will tell members why not because we have no control over our margins we have no control over our production costs we have all the planning in the world but we take all the risks in the world it is an unique kind of business we do it better here in the united states than any place in the world we are the greatest agricultural technologists there are the greatest producers on a unit basis but we do not ever get any kind of a margin benefit out of these programs we are never sure how long we can stay in this kind of a business as a result of that when i first came to congress in 1980 there were 4 percent of the population of this country involved directly involved in agriculture today it is about 2 2 percent so tell me about high interest rates tell me about other things that nobody can control in the agricultural communities that has driven these people off of the agricultural production plain rolled it into larger and larger operations so you have scale as a matter of fact for the family of four today to be involved in agriculture to have any kind of a chance of surviving in that particular endeavor it takes about a 1 5 to 2million basic investment that is in land and equipment and so forth so it is a highcost highrisk undertaking q t we in the united states produce the best food the best quality food and the best quantity of food of any nation in the world we are helping the rest of the world feed itself through our own technology we have reduced the spending in agriculture through various programs over the years we have gotten rid of the honey program it cost us dearly because we cut the program but we did not say that we had to go back and make good on the deficit payments that we had to make to honey growers we are phasing out the wool program which is supposed to be a big savings it has absolutely saved not one dime because they are still collecting the tariffs and those costs are still carried out to the taxpayers so if you were going to get it off the taxpayers you missed one more time there are several other reasons for looking at this business of how are we going to cut because when we are dealing with this we do not always want to get what we pray for because if we keep going in the direction we are going in agriculture in cutting the core we are not going to have any core production it is just that simple we do it or we do not do it we came up with the best we could user fees is not a new idea around this place it was initiated sometime ago also this is the straw we are trying to grasp to produce the kindof inspection we owe the people and consumers of this country today it may not be the best way to do it but that is about the only avenue that we had to explore in that particular vein to get inspections done it is not a happy solution to this thing but if you have got a better one come up with it we need all the help we can get we appreciate that and we have the authorizing committee that will be involved in this process because if they want to raise the allotments in those particular areas they have the authority to do that with that i want to say that we have done the best we can with this bill we are not apologizing to anybody for what we have done we have made the cuts where we thought they should be and the increases where we thought they should be we have all agreed on it that we are going to support this thing i know it does not smell good or taste good but it is about the only kind of medicine we have available to us let us get on with the business of taking care of agriculture in this country and let the people there produce rather than worry about what we are going to do to them next i reserve the balance of my time"],

the media and from special groups like common cause is so great that there is probably not much chance that we are going to beable to reverse the tide i thought i would tonight take a little bit of time and try to express my concerns about the ethics reform bill that we are talking about that just passed the senate a similar bill just passed the house to tell you why i oppose many provisions in it and why it is going to be bad for the institutioncalled the congress of the united states and bad for the american people right now we have a policy which demands that every time we do anything that costs money from a lobbyist or a person who takes us out to lunch or dinner or buys us any kind of a small gift we have to report it on our fec report that is going to be changed with the new ethics reform bill to such a degree that many of our constituents will not even be able to converse with us let me just give an example right now if a businessman or a businesswoman wants to take a client out to lunch or a friend out to lunch they do that and they deduct it in many cases from their taxes many times a constituent or a group of constituents will come to washington 10 or 15 and they will say we want to sit down with our congressman over lunch and talk to them about problems of our state and because there are 10 or 15 of them the congressman cannot afford to buy everybodys lunch or dinner so they will take him out to lunch or dinner so they can have the opportunity to spend a long period of time with him talking about their problems or their concerns under the new ethics reform law if they go out and have lunch a 2 50 sandwich the person buying the sandwich and the congressman or congresswoman will be guilty of a crime that is going too far that is just going too far if a congressman or congresswoman says to a friend visiting washington or maybe even back in their district would you like to go out and play golf and the congressman or congresswoman pays for that that is all right if a businessman pays for that if a friend pays for that that is all right but if a person takes a congressman or congresswoman out to play golf or tennis or something like that that is going to be a crime not only for the congressman but for the person who is paying the freight charity golf events and charity events that have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for different charities cancer research ronald mcdonald house and a lot of other charities like that instead of the federal government paying for it instead of the taxpayer paying for it many of these charity events pay for it a lot of those are going to be stopped completely because congressmen and congresswomen will not be able to participate any longer they are going to cut that out i think that that is something that ought to be looked at with a jaundiced eye because if these charity events are done away with across the country and maybe this is a first step toward eliminating them altogether i dont know then the government is going to have to pay for it and that is going to mean the taxpayer is going to pay for it individual citizens individual businesspersons do not have these kinds of restrictions and they should not have i do not think we should have a double standard where congress should be any better off or any worse off than the private sector what we are going to see if we pass the senate ethics proposal is you wont be able to have lunch with anybody if they buy you a sandwich because it will be illegal you wont be able to go to a sporting event with them if they buy you a ticket because it will be illegal and both of you will commit a crime you wont be able to play golf with anybody or tennis with anybody if they pay the fee at all because it will be a crime you wont be able to participate in any charity events that raise monies for charity because it will be a crime i just think that is going too far it is just going too far what is the answer the answer is to let your constituents and let the people of america in on everything we do report it all if we get a small gift report it limit the gift but report it if we go out to lunch with somebody report it so our constituents know who is buying our lunch or who is going out to be with us for a sporting event or whatever it may be if we go too far you may rest assured that the media that is always following everything that congressmen and congresswomen do they will report it and they will report it on the front pages of the paper and the political pressure will be so great that congressmen and congresswomen will have to change what they are doing that is the way it should be to make criminals of congressmen and congresswomen because they go out and have a sandwich with somebody is wrong to make criminals of congressmen and congresswomen because they play golf or tennis with somebody and make the person paying that a criminal as well is wrong to stop us from participating in charity events that help cancer research and help organizations like ronald mcdonald house and others like that is just dead wrong most of my colleagues are scared to death to come down here and talk about this they have tried to put some loophole in the senate provision by saying if you go out with a friend that that does not qualify as something being purchased by somebody who may lobby you for something what are we going to do are we going to have congressmen going around with a sheaf of letters and when they go to have lunch with somebody say i hereby say that i am dan burtons friend or im the congressmans friend and you have them sign it and then you have record back in your office that it was a friend that bought you that sandwich or that round of golf or whatever it might be you could drive a truck through that loophole and i guarantee it will be on the front page of the paper shortly after that passes and it will make congress look even worse than it has in live or 60 minutes or some other the past show the way to solve the problem is to make everything clear and above board and reported in our fec report so the world knows about it but do not start creating criminal penalties if somebody buys you a mcdonalds hamburger or takes you out to play a round of golf or takes you to see a basketball game besides that it is going to be very very hard for usthey said in some cases that they will allow you back in your home district to have somebody take you to lunch or take you to dinner or you can go out and play a round of golf with them the problem with that is they may be a lobbyist and you will have to just carry that ethics reform law with you everywhere you go to make sure you do not violate it there will be members of this body and the other body that will inadvertently violate the law and some of them may be subject to prosecution down the road not because they intentionally violated the law but because they unintentionally did because ignorance of the law is no excuse as we have heard many times in the past i would just like to say to my colleagues that i am confident that they are going to pass this bill i am confident that it is going to become law but i think it is a step in the wrong direction a more realistic way to solve the problem is to report everything and let the people know the facts and the country will be safe and i would like to add to that and say let the people know the facts and congressmen will toe the mark 0 1930 that is the way to do it instead of making these criminal offenses i would like to say just one more thing which really galls me there was a charity golf event this past monday i believe and there were about 30 or 35 congressmen that played in it and 35 000 was raised for charity 35 000 raised for charity i believe it was abc that was out there in a plain blue van going around the golf course peeking through the trees they had a tripod with a telephoto lens trying to take pictures of members of congress with other members of congress and the people that put on the charity event trying to make it look like there was something horribly wrong with that and i want to tell members that really bothers me that the media and these scandal shows are out there trying to make something like a charity event look like something that is a crime because there was not anything wrong with that and there is not anything wrong with that for congressmen who are busy 6 7 days a week to go out and participate in a charity event that raises money for a good charity to be scared to death to even go participate because they are afraid they are going to be on television on prime time so i guess i have vented my spleen tonight i think if i had all of my colleagues up here speaking what is really in their heart i believe the majority in both the house and the senate would agree with me the answer is not to create criminal penalties for us having lunch or playing golf with somebody in this capitol or in our home district the answer is to report everything the answer is not to do away with charitable events that are going to help many worthwhile charities because congressmen and congresswomen cannot participate the answer is for us to report when we participate in those events and if we participate in too many of them then i am sure that we will be taken to task by our constituents with that i think i have said my piece"], [0.4871249794960022, 0.4871249794960022, 0, "the problem is not the gop and five dozen democrats the problem is the crime bill we can have a much better crime bill one that is paid for and one that will get tough on crime and one that will fix some of the problems that the conferees wanted to be fixed the conferees took out four or five gettough measures that the senate put in the conferees ignored seven motions to instruct that this house of representatives put in the conferees did sneak in or at least members in the conference snuck in projects that neither body apparently knew about what we call pure pork 10 million for a university somewhere in texas the conference report required a rule to protect parts of this bill that we do not even know what it said or did not know at the time we voted and the other thing is that most members of this congress in fact i think i can say every member of this house had not read the crime bill we voted on because there was not time to do it under the rule we reported out the crime bill as we had a chance to look at it that we voted on in the past 5 days had some good and some bad parts there is quite a list of social programs about 9 billion dollars worth part of the problem with those they are not high priority and they are paid through the patronage system they are not paid through competitive grants they are done on the whoyouknowinwashington basis h8411 there is also no accountability for a great deal of that money nine billion dollars we do not know whether it is going to work there is no standard there is no measure there is no come back and report and find out if this worked nine billion dollars is a lot of money that talk about getting tough on crime sort of goes pale when we see that we are going to let something like 10 000 people who have been convicted of drug crimes who are in jail now out because they are lower priority and we need those prison spaces for higher priority i have already been asked by some constituents in my district if one of those 10 000 is going to be the son of joycelyn elders who was recently convicted of such a crime i do not know the answer to that this supposed 100 000 policemen on the streets that are going to be put in that we have heard so much about from the white house aqtually there is ofily funding in this bill for about 20 000 policemen on the streets and if we were to divide that into three 8hour shifts which is what we have to do when we are running a police department at any given moment in america right now that will be an additional 6 000 or 7 000 policemen i say to my colleagues well when you divide that countrywide you can see thats a help but its not going to be a gigantic help and frankly most of those police are going to go into the urban areas that are decided by somebody else and most communities are not going to get those policemen there is no habeas corpus reform in this bill and this bill is not paid for it is a budget buster it is about 25 billion added to the deficit over the next 10 years or so and we do not even know how much it will cost beyond that nevertheless we need a crime bill and we have the ability to get a crime bill and to deliver a crime bill and if we had perhaps little more help from the white house on focusing on a gettough crime bill that would pass here instead of the demagoguery that is going on i think we can accomplish it some of the things that we are worried about is that my colleague and friend the gentlewoman from washington introduced an amendment for tracking sexually violent predators and community notification now some of my colleagues may remember picking up a paper a few weeks ago and reading about a 7yearold youngster in a town in new jersey who was strangled is a sex crime by a known sexual offender who was living in that community been no community notification we wanted those requirements put in this bill so that that kind of thing cannot happen again and i ask you know what we instructed the conferees to put it in and you know what they left it out and youknow what theyre accountableless to tell us why andyou know what they didnt tell us so that family was not invited to the rose garden yesterday by the white house and i do not know why i hope the president will correct that oversight i feel very sorry for that family and all families in that situation and we have the ability to fix that and make this crime bill right in this country we asked for 13 5 billion for prison funding by a vote of 338 to 81 in this chamber and do my colleagues know what the conferees did not do that they cut itby 5 billion and they did not explain why they just ignored the instructions of 338 members of this house it seems to me we can do better when everybody in america is saying lock up the criminals please lock up the criminals we want to be safe on the streets in our houses in our cars when we go to the store andl if you let those criminals out we will not be safe everybody in america understands that why did we chop out 5 billion i do not know we need to do better than that we had a provision to instruct the conferees for minimum sentences for crimes carried out with handguns now my colleagues would think that would be pretty simple to do we are having all this fuss about an assault weapons ban but we cannot even get a provision in in this crime bill this supposedly gettoughoncrime bill that says if you carry out a crime with a handgun that you get a severe minimum sentence it seems to me that is

to the right and walks to the left on all bills that we have seen the language that this administration uses does not match with the words that they write in their bills you will recall the very first commercial that candidate clinton put out during the campaign was to end welfare as we know it to get tough on welfare get people out working for themselves again that rang well in the ears of the electorate that is something the americans have been thinking and worrying about for some time we spent 5 trillion since 1965 on the poor and the poverty rate has gone from 12 8 to 14 1 percent what has the administration written on this welfare reform not one word indeed the liberals on the democrat side will not let welfare reform come to the fore because those folks on those plantations are their voters last year on the budget the president you will recall during the campaign said we are going to have a middle class tax cut in the last debate he said if any of my proposals would require any tax increase i will drop them then he said in december well i have been surprised by a budget deficit that was much larger than i thought and we are going to have to have the largest tax increase in history however it will only affect the top 1 2 percent of the income earners well he needs to talk to those people who are retired and making 40 000 a year and who have got a 70 percent increase in the taxes on their social security i am sure they do not consider themselves in the top 1 2 percent but they got the tax increase he needs to talk to the truck driver who makes a living going across our roads who pays 4 3 cents per gallon more in new taxes every day on health care the president made it clear he was going to provide everybody with universal coverage that you cannot lose lifetime security in health care he was going to improve your choices improve the quality of care and reduce the cost well words mean things words are the currency of this profession and you cannot just keep lying to the american people we learned you do not listen to what they say you read what they write when the president was interviewed on cbs by paula zahn she said could someone go to their own doctor and pay them with their own cash the president said of course you can that is not what his bill says you may do it but you would be guilty of bribery and the doctor who takes the money is guilty of a felony worth a 10 000 fine the most recent example of course is the crime bill we are working on on the floor of the house at this time the president promised to expand the number of crimes for which capital punishment can obtain and they brag about that but in fact the procedural roadblocks put into this bill make it unlikely that anyone will ever be put to death for any federal crime again the president promised to get tougher on habeas corpus the endless appeals to shorten them in fact as the speaker before me said they are dramatically lengthened we even add an additional governmentpaid lawyer for those appealing the president promised in a press conference last september and in his state of the union that he is going to endorse three strikes and you are out three violent felonies and you are in prison forever well the bill says that but procedurally it makes it virtually impossible to apply to anyone and indeed of the thousands and thousands of people in prison on federal charges today only 500 would be eligible for the difficult procedure to use the three strikes and you are out it has been said that somewhere between 15 and 25 percent in some states of all the people in our federal prisons are there as illegal aliens did we get tough on that and send them home no we do not address that the president did not do one thing in his crime bill about addressing the root cause of crime which is not insecurity and lack of selfconfidence it is drugs neighborhood use of drugs the communicable disease spread by user to user in our neighborhoods we do not address that it is obvious to everyone who looks at this problem and it is repeated over and over that 6 percent of americans commit 70 to 80 percent of all crimes those are studies that go back

yielding time and i would like to thank him for his efforts in putting together this special order and for his leadership on this issue i come to the floor tonight to take part in this as a former small businessman as a matter of fact as someone who still owns part of a small business back in ohio in trying to look at what is going on here in congress with regard to health care from the viewpoint of a small business person trying to succeed in america if we begin to look at the clinton bill clintongephardt bill the clintonmitchell bill you will see that the central pain feature to pay for those bills is the employer mandate it has been estimated by a number of research firms that that employer mandate will cost americans 1 to 3 million americans their jobs for those americans who do not lose their jobs they are going to see their wages reduced their fringebenefits reduced as a result of this requirement to make employers pay some 25 million american workers are estimated to be in this category that may see their wages not increase as fast as inflation or their benefits reduced companies that can pass along this increasing cost are going to do that what does that do that is nothing more than a tax on consumers because it causes consumers to go out and consume those goods and services the companies provide and they are required to pay higher prices because of this mandate it is nothing more than a tax on them because of it small businesses in america that currently do not offer health insurance would love to be able to do so today because it makes good business sense and it makes good business sense today because if you want to be successful we all know the key to a small business succeeding are the employees that they are able to keep on their payroll because it is not the owner of the business that makes it successful it is the employees that they have that make every company in america as successful as they are if they could do it they would but the reason they are not is very simply there are a lot of marginal businesses in this country think about your local dry cleaner think about the local grocery store owner or maybe the local gas station that is being hit not only with health care mandates and employer mandates but being hit by the clean air act and other laws and other agencies of the federal government forcing up their costs to compound this problem or to solve this problem i should say what the clinton folks and the gephardt folks and the people over in the other body want to do is to offer subsidies to small employers because they know if they have an employer mandate it is going to have a devastating impact on employment in america so they want to overcome this by giving subsidies to small employers where do these subsidies come from they come from the taxpayers either we are going to raise taxes or we are going to cut spending but when it is all said and done it is going to come from taxpayers many of whom are small business people in america the second point i would make about subsidies is this promise we are going to subsidize this it is not going toreally cost you very much that is what we say but what is going to happen next year when the budget crunch gets a little tougher what is going to happen the year after we all know what thehistory of promises from congress are we can all look 5 years down the road 7 years down the road and realize those subsidies arenot going to be there and the employer is going to get stuck with the bill the third point i make about subsidies is the fact that they are based on the size of a company i do not know that it makes any sense to say that just because you have 10 employees that you are more marginal than a company with 100 employees you just may not be as large in my company we had five employees we were very successful however there are a lot of companies much larger that were in a much more marginal situation as we begin to look at the clinton gephardt clintonmitchell plans i think they have very serious problems from the viewpoint of a small business person what is the alternative i think the alternative based on the rowlandbilirakis bill would greatly assist small businesses in providing health insurance to their employees without mandates and without new taxes we would do this in several ways first we would allow small businesses to more easily group for the purposes of selfinsuring pooling their resources pooling their risk in order to bring their costs down if you are a small employer with 5 employees or 10 and you go to an insurance company and ask for a group policy they laugh at you because if you have anyone in that risk pool of 5 or 10 employees that has any kind of a health problem it is going to put the rates out of reach for most employers so by expanding the risk pool we bring better rates to more employers it is going to entice more employers to provide insurance for their employees second we deal with those with preexisting conditions through a modified community rating system a lot of these employers have an employee or an employees spouse or child that has a preexisting condition that puts their costs out of control if we solve the problem with preexisting conditions as we do in the bipartisan approach we again make it cheaper for small employers to find insurance for their employees third we change the tax code so that the selfemployed who today can only deduct 25 percent of the cost of their health care insurance premiums would be able to deduct the full cost of those premiums why is this important if you are a corporation of any sort you are allowed to fully deduct the cost of health care for your employees and yourself however if you are a partnership a sole proprietorship if you are a farmer you can only deduct 25 percent of those premiums it is discriminatory therefore if we put in 100 percent deductiblity for employers it is going to entice more of those small employers to in fact be able to offer insurance to their employees this type of approach based on the market based on having faith in the free enterprise system we believe best delivers more health care to more americans as opposed to the clinton idea we all know the government is too big and spends too much we all know clearly that as we see in the clinton bill that has been around for the last 9 months we all know that is going to do nothing more than make government bigger and make it more expensive the american people are trusting us to do the right thing with their money the american people have a certain cynicism about government they have heard about welfare they have seen welfare not work there has been a lot of promises given but very little in the way of results that have been received by average americans therefore as we begin to debate the health care issue we begin to move forward i would urge my colleagues to do what the american people want that is trust them and to put these decisions in their hands and not in the hands of bigger and more expensive government i thank the gentleman from indiana"], [0.4875553250312805, 0.4875553250312805, 0, "i would like to thank the gentleman from california for putting together this special order and addressing this subject i think he has done an outstanding job on many occasions with these special orders in bringing to the publics attention a number of concerns the one that i am speaking on this evening is the eeoc regulations that were promulgated last october and made known through a hearing period and in effect have been recognized by companies in this country so strongly that many of the private companies have issued regulations dealing with those proposed eeoc regulations they is sued rules for their companies now what would these eeoc rules do first of all they would say that in the work place under the guise of religious harassment under title 7 that we could not have any mention of religion either positive or negative and that is essentially what the company that issued its regulations has said that would include jewelry artifacts potential conversations of employees dealing in this area now this is as much a question of first amendment protection as it is anything else it is not the necessity to sponsor any religion under any particular name it is not the necessity to be against any religion under a name it is to say that the framers of the constitution gave us a bill of rights and that first amendment protected us in the area of religion it was not that we wanted a state religion on the contrary the framers of the constitution had seen that experience before and wanted nothing to do with the state of religion but they did want religion in the state and over the 200 years of our history in this country we have recognized that fact and here comes today bureaucrats that have devised rules that say no this is wrong this is something that we cannot tolerate it will be harass ment if you mention any sort of religious activity invitesomeone to sunday school do something else in the work place that will be harassment now this could have been stopped the president with one phone call could have stopped this months ago the president could have said this is wrong this is something i dont want to see it seems to be encouraging rather than discouraping and lets see what the effect is yesterday i met with a group of nascar drivers they said they could have had a truckload if they had had time to put it together but we had seven or eight come down and point out one of the things that concerns them about the eeoc regulations they pointed out that each sunday since that is the day of the race at the track they have a minister who has a special service for the drivers now they are about to get in about a four by four space of solid metal it is about 140 degrees on a summer day out there and they are going around laps between 100 and 200 miles per hour risking their life in a sport they love if they want to have a special service conducted by a minister on sunday morning before they start the race who are we to say that they cannot who are we to tell the fans the hundred thousands or so that are going to be watching that race im sorry we cant have that race because we think there might be some religious harassment going on here in the stadium before the sports race starts the necessity and the reason we have the freedom of a bill of rights is to let everyone make up their own mind in these areas to let everyone have the freedom to do as they please in these areas the government in my district people recognize would mess up a onecar funeral and yet we are calling on them to devise regulations and tell us how to micromanage our lives in this most sensitiye of areas it is absolutely ridiculous that we are getting to this point i had a marine write a letter an officer in the marines he said first of all we are going to have to change the marine motto if this goes on because semper fidelis is just part of the motto the motto is always faithful to god and country nowwe will have to remove god obviously because that will not be allowed in our workplace and the chaplain may not be able to miiister either in the battlefield or in the barracks because that is the workplace of those individuals so it is a situation where with each step we get more and more ridiculous i served on committees with the gentleman from california who has put together this special order and i maintain that the depths of dumb cannot be fathomed in washington dc that does not mean there are not good people here i served with intelligent people in the house and in the senate people whose character is above reproach but somehow as we pass legislation and it becomes promulgated into ever finer regulations on the american people all of us who have human weaknesses and fallacies are going to make the errors and that is passed on and put on the american people as onerous rules and regulations somehow that comes about and we continue to pile these on the american people day after day we issue between 60 000 and 100 000 pages of regulations in the federal registry every year those are regulations like the eeoc regulations that have to be recognized and obeyed as the law of the land one last comment i would like to make and i know the gentleman from california is a cosponsor of this and that is we have legislation our amendment tomorrow that will deny the eeoc funding to enforce the religious regulations that it has and i hope that amendment will pass it will give us a year to go in and change those regulations abolish those regulations if the house sees fit and to correct that problem but what about the future the gentleman has cosponsored with me a piece of legislation that would require whenever rules and regulations or whenever the bill is passed and then goes to the appropriate bureaucracy for rules and regulations to be promulgated they would have to come back to this house to be examined by this house and then approved or disapproved we could save the american people an enormous amount of grief and trouble if we would pass that regulation and if we pass that law and keep those regulations from being put on the public until we get a chance to assess them i want to tell the gentleman again how

bill i know there are going to be different people saying different things but let me just tell my colleagues why i believe that it is not a partisan issue because the person who had this job before me former congressman joe fisher was opposed to changing and modifying and repealing the hatch act most federal employees are honest and decent people and this bill will politicize the federal work force i believe h r 20 will scuttle a policy that has been in effect from thomas jeffersons time having been raised in philadelphia in south philadelphia and seeing the political pressure that can be brought on federal employees state employees but particularly city employees this bill is absolutely wrong has anyone focused on the fact that the white house under the leadership of mack mcclarty fired five federal employees career federal employees in the travel office because they did not do what somebody wanted i saw very few members in this body stand up and speak for the travel office employees now let me tell you something about these career federal employees they almost all have legal bills of over 20 000 each when a member of congress gets in trouble what do they do oh they write their financial supporters and they get the money out of their campaign funds and they take care of their legal fees who will take care of the legal fees of these federal employees one of these individuals is my constituent who will take care of their legal fees the answer is no one no one under this bill it is a bad bill have you seen the reinventing of government that al gore wants they are talking about rifing 250 000 employees and the clinton administration wants to be able to pick what employees they buy out and move out well what is permitted will be what is expected and if you do not participate in the political activity what will happen in the old days they come by and say you know we are having a fundraiser for x today we would like you to buy five tickets at 100 apiece what will happen what will happen when they change the performance appraisal for the federal employee and the employee is bumped out what will happen to the man or woman who does not want to participate where is the support for changing the hatch act are federal employees for this bill your offices have not been called by federal employees you have been called by federal unions you have been called by the white house you have been called by special interests but i doubt if you have ever been called by federal employees i saw the last speaker the gentlewoman from virginia who now represents most of the former congressional district that i had did she get any calls from federal employees i represented 65 percent of that district and almost every federal employee said do not repeal the hatch act they said congressman it gives us the protection so we dont have to participate in and make financial contributions to they do not want it so where has the outcry been now if you want to separate out the postal service i think the chairman has a very good idea the postal employees fine but the federal employees are not asking for it in addition you are now accepting the amendment that i tried to offer which i was not given the chance to offer but you know what you have done by accepting that you have actually acknowledged by exempting irs and cia employees you have acknowledged that there is potential corruption by accepting that amendment you have acknowledged that there is a problem so you do not want coercion on the cia but it is ok to coerce the department of labor or osha you do not want to coerce the irs but it is ok to coerce meat inspectors or poultry inspectors the bill is flawed by the very nature of that fact lastly i know the votes are not here to defeat this bill because the wheels are rolling and this administration is going to sign it this bill will probably be repealed again i would hope that when the republicans take control again whenever that time may be that we repeal this because this is a bill that will bring about corruption as the son of a philadelphia policeman in the inner city i saw what can happen back in philadelphia if you even wanted a scholarship for somebody you had to know somebody and i know the next speaker is going to talk about it you had to know somebody in the state legislature or be involved in the political process we do not want that in the federal government we have an honest ethical moral highcaliber federal civil service and federal employees are not crying for this bill and

times is against it the washington times is against it the wall street journal i heard the gentleman from new york say that is why the wall street journal is against it the wall street journal is opposed to it the washington times is opposed to it the l a times is opposed to it it is a bad bill i respect the gentlemen for their efforts to try to pass it i really think it will be bad for

understand that land can be taken by the federal government but in the past there are lands that have been tried to be condemned or taken by the federal government and the federal government cannot pay for those lands we are up to 3 billion in back moneys that we need to buy the lands that we already have while that is happening the person that owns the property goes onto a list but yet they are still under the laws that prevent them from doing most things with their property there will be an attempt to offer an amendment to the amendment and what it does and i read with the exception and all that follows and insert unless and until acquired by the united states no lands within the boundaries of wilderness areas or national park system units designated or enlarged by this act that are owned by any person or entity other than the united states shall be subject to any of the rules or regulations applicable solely to the federal lands within such boundaries and may be used to the extent allowed by applicable law what that does any time there is a take provision for an endangered species or a take it basically guts everything we are trying to do here i am offering this amendment on private property rights on behalf of myself and my colleagues the gentleman from louisiana who cannot be here with us today who had an excuse the gentleman from north carolina and all of us are accepting an amendment that protects the people that are having their lands taken away by the federal government all we are asking for is they pay for those lands before those restrictions go on to them in california desert protection act there are over 7 million acres of wilderness and new natural parks although most of the land is currently public land there are 700 000 acres of private property that would become inholdings within the national parks and wilderness upon enactment most of this private land you will find is a checkerboard pattern throughout the proposed parks there are now approximately 150 000 acres owned by small private owners just like my friend the gentleman from california we do not want to take exception just to the large companies but the small people one hundred fifty thousand acres owned by individuals ranchers owners of private property and again all we are asking is if the government is going to take that land that they pay for it but right now the government does not have the money most of this land is within the proposed mojave national park unfortunately these owners who do not have wellorganized political lobbyists and did not get special treatment from the congress like the two largest land owners the example of the gentlewoman from california in the other body have not had the opportunity to have this come up as a result it could be years before their lands are brought before the federal government the national park service already has a backlog of two to three billion and i say billion dollars not million dollars or a shortfall in funds that we already have that we cannot pay while those farmers and ranchers are waiting they are subject to rules which keep them from doing anything with their property for example if they want to apply for a permit to put a new dwelling on it they cannot do it what this amendment does is it protects those private property rights so that when the federal government says we want your land that is okay but pay for it and then those rules and regulations will be applicable not during the long period in between it is a private property issue because of this massive land acquisition backlog and the fact that congress typically underfunds the national park service with the president wanting to reduce the deficit there is no way we are going to be able in the future to pay for these lands so again these landholders are going to be sitting in limbo and not able to use their land history shows these property owners land is actually purchased by the park service it just does not work in the community of foresta ca as an example located within yosemite national park was a scene when we had a terrible fire when my dad was alive we used to go up there every summer but because of the fire the national park said to local landowners that had their property burn down and they tried to rebuild they were opposed every step of the way by the park service which said that the development was notcompatible with the purposes of the park the park service even fought thecounty the zoning officials which supported the rebuilding effort i have a lot of examples but in the interests of time we will not go through them bt time after time after time it has prevented property rights and people that own their property from doing anything with that land i submit this with

oregon because i thought he made a lot of excellent points first let me thank the new chairman from the intelligence committee because i have been very impressed with his leadership but i must say it is a different world none of us would say it is a different world none of us would say it is a peaceful world but we would say it is a different kind of environment we have to target by not being able to talk about this openly we do not know if we are targeting it right or not i was very pleased this year that the committee on armed services did practically its entire markup in the open i think that is a real change we have never seen that happen before i would hope that that would be a reason we could at least say how much we are spending on this whole area of intelligence second let me put a few things up the gentleman from oregon pointed out very well that why we have been so focused on the international arms race one of the things we forgot to look at was our domestic arms race and our domestic arms race is very out of control cities such as mine are reeling from that i think an awful lot of our constituents are much more fearful about getting shot as they drive to the grocery store than they are about having some missile coming at them i also thought the gentleman made an excellent point about the ridiculous statements that have been made in one of the prior newspaper stories and that was that we cannot fire anybody here that is why we have to keep the budget so high because if we fire them they will tell well i certainly hope that is not true i certainly hope as we look at different threats in the world radical fundamentalism and so on that there is an ability to shift the kind of personnel needs to people who understand that rather than hang on to people from the prior cold war at any cost for fear that they will say something finally let me say if we cut this money there are so many uses for it domestically and every other way remember we are still leaving 90 percent intact which is more money than most countries spend on absolutely everything in their national budget one of the things that has worried me the most is that in intelligence one of the things people talk about is maybe we ought to have intelligence out there to watch our national technology base to make sure that there are not foreigners coming in and stealing secrets from americas corporations now at the very time we are seeing that we just finished this incredible competition where we went out and we asked people to take the research we were doing in these hightechnology classified areas and figure out a way to put it out in the civilian sector we had this terrific competition ceo said we think this is silly its you liberals talking about defense diversification it wont work we have 471 million and guess what if we funded all the things that came in in this competition we would need 8 3 billion and the people applying have to put in half that money so it would be almost 17 billion all together that we would have out there to start new jobs right away now let me tell my colleagues that if we do not pick upthis resource if we do not find some way to fund all those applications that came in guess what foreign investors are going to fund them they are drooling to fund them on a 5050 match and we will not need the intelligence community to tell us why they went offshore they went offshore because we had a competition got people excited they came forward and thought of all sorts of new market approaches for the things we have invested in as taxpayers in defense that had been classified and then we could not fund it at this point we are going to be able to fund about oneseventeenth of the proposals and every one of the proposals is appearing to be jurored very very high this is eating our seed corn so madam chairman this is not saying that all of the world is peaceful we do not need it it is saying the world is different it is not peaceful let us reconfigure it is not saying that the future is not looking at intelligence but make sure the people there are looking at the proper things and it is also saying we have new threats domestically in our cities and new threats to build a tech base in the civilian side where we do not rely totally on government contracts coming from the defense department or the intelligence department and everything else is offshore that is a miserable future for this country defense diversification is our future and we are sitting here looking at the most successful thing anyone could dream of and it is going to go down the chute because we do not have any money to fund it so i think these are places where we could find the money we could begin funding these things and we can begin instant job creation in a very critical area that will help us retain some of that defense and technology base forwarding and that is one of the ideas i would have and i would hope people would vote

care issue if we do not have personal responsibility doest prouniversal coverage we donot we miss mote high standards does it protectabout 22 million people whowill still americaniclftiens at home and abroad members can even apply that to health care i salute my colleague the gentleman from south carolina who just said a few moments ago let us not fool the american people i agree with that what i am prepared to do here tonight for you the american people is to talk about not only the politics of health care the pragmatism of health care and the plans of health care the only way i can do that is that i have prepared a chart a road map of my thoughts i am going to explain this because it helps explain the actual debate that is going on right now about health care right here along this section this is where we presently are in america this is the present hybrid health care system that we have in america the reason i call it a hybrid system that we have is because we have medicaid medicare the va the veterans administration hospitals and clinics and we have the military health care delivery system we really technically have a hybrid health care system in the hybrid system that we have we have come along and said the present system that promotes the greatest quality health care system in the world and the system that also preserves the greatest choice of an individual of doctor or facility or alternative methods of treatment is at 85 percent right now we are right here right here at this square at 85 percent so we because of our compassion and sincerity for the uninsured and underinsured we seek to do better we also recognize that there are growing costs and we try to seek cost containment how do we want to do that do we want to move forward this way or do we want to take this direction let me explain here at the 95 percent or actually i should write 94 percent there is a system that is referred to in washington here a lot called the hawaiian health care system it has 94 percent coverage it is a universal coverage system it has been in effect for 20 years and has only been able to achieve 94 percent think about this for a moment if we are presently at 85 percent and the a model universal coverage health care right now is the hawaiian system and it is exempt it is exempt from what ever plan is going to be passed here so they must like the 94 percent now think about this utilize common sense when you were in school and you got a 85 or an 87 on a test how did you feel you probably felt pretty good you did not say oh my gosh my 87 85 is a failure i have to go out and get an all new method of learning no you did not say that if you want to get to 94 you work harder at what you are presently doing you dont go out and say i need to get a brain transplant to move to 94 percent what we seek to do is increase the access maintain the quality and have cost containment how do we do that we do it by working on what is wrong with the present system and not moving to brain transplant let us think about what is really happening out there it is wonderful to get up and talk to america and say im going to be the protector of the middle class im going to deliver to you less it is not going to cost you incredible the american people did not wake up yesterday it almost reminds me of a knockknock joke knock knock who is there the government the government who i am the government and i am here to save you come on the american people are much smarter than that so if we are paused right here this is where we are at 85 percent there are those of us that believe and support incremental reforms to the present system to open up the access to permit greater risk pooling out there we also recognize when i say open up the access i am referring to allow small businesses whether it is local chambers or associations to create greater risk pools so there is greater integration in the health care economy both vertically and horizontally as we do that we also as we are paused right here there are those here in the congress that say you know what we need to do is we should have incremental reforms to a singlepayer system they are not saying that they are not going to say that because they want to fool the american people you see the real goal is a singlepayer plan a canadianstyle universal coverage system for america but they are not going to say it they are not going to say it the ones that i respect in this body are those who come out and say i believe in a canadianstyle health care system for america i respect them because they come right out and look you in the eye and say that is my sincere belief the ones in america that you should be scared of and frightened of are the ones that finesse it they finesse it by saying well we are just going to have some triggers we are going to help out the small business sector we are going to help out the middle class we are going to protect you we are going to look out for you let me explain what this is we are right here they are sophisticated they meaning the liberal side of the democrat party is sophisticated enough that they cannot make a hard left turn and take america directly to a singlepayer plan they cannot move from here to a singlepayer plan america will say no and reject it what is their answer their answer is substantive incremental reforms to a singlepayer system so they want to move from here and take america this direction that is the debate that is going on right now the president is going to say i might loosen up a little bit vice president gore yesterday said we might relax maybe 10 years out may be acceptable it may not be acceptable we will have to look at it what are they really talking about they are talking about how to move america to a singlepayer plan without telling you without telling you so what they seek to do here is move america from the 85 percent and go this direction they want to turn left and take america this direction now this time period could last anywhere from 7 to 10 years time enough to pull america into a malaise then when they get out here in the year 2000 2002 they turn around and say those of you who like congressman buyer back in 1994 said we need incremental reforms from the present system they will say see steve you were wrong we tried but we could not make it think about this they tried what they are going to do is in the reforms they are going to rewxlte up there in the back room that we may or may not get a chance to see before we are voting on itwhich is an incredible thought they control the process when they control the process they can then control the substance and predetermine the outcome of legislation get it i got it so what they are going to do is set unrealistic expectations in different sectors of the health care economy that cannot be achieved that is why they are saying out here 95 percent we have hawaii that has been doing it for 20 years and which they are exempting and they cannot even reach 95 percent so the goal the goal is by the liberal side of this body is to move america to a canadianstyle health care system but they are not going to say it they are not going to say it because they are scared to death they are scared to death that you will not send them back to this body and their job to them is so important what is it they are going to try to do they are going to try and fool the american people i agree with my colleague the gentleman from south carolina let us not fool the american people there are those of us that firmly believe that we do not need a brain transplant when it comes to health care what it is we support are incremental reforms to the present health care system that increases the access and permits greater risk pooling to occur we seek tort reform medical malpractice reform 100percent deductibility of insurance premiums the list goes on and on there are many things that we can do to the present system without sacrificing the quality without diluting the quality without restricting the freedom of choice of doctors and facilities and alternative methods of treatment let alone of its impact

that are happening here with some of the kinds of catastrophes we see and the serious problems being experienced in my district it is very difficult to relate to the constituents of ones district exactly what relevance the activities in washington have to the daytoday problems they face but they are quite relevant whatever we do down here is quite relevant we have just passed a crime bill out of the house of representatives it has gone to conference with the senate and that crime bill is quite relevant to what is happening with crime in my district and all other districts the crime bill was passed and it calls for billions of dollars to be expended to build more prisons it also calls for a threestrikesandyoureout provision forpeople to be placed in prison of life some very expensive measures are included in the crime bill however very little money is included for programs that were introduced by the congressional black caucus which call for preventive efforts to be financed by the federal government more afterschool centers for young people midnight basketball programs and more treatment programs for drug addicts a number of the things that were accepted in the bill are accepted with such small amounts of money that they will be quite ineffective once they are implemented the crime bill had some good features i do not want to criticize the total crime bill and we do need some new policemen additional policemen would be allocated to communities based on the implementation of the authorization of the crime bill a hundred thousand new policemen were re quested by the president the senate and the house have different responses to that but more policemen in the localities and more payment for police activities at the local level are verymuch needed across the country now there are some other good features in the bill also but there is a glaring omission from the bill one that is hard to explain to my constituents there is a glaring omission from the house bill of any concern with gun control there are no provisions for dealing with gun control in any reasonable or meaningful manner guns are at the heart ofthe problem with crime the deadliness of crime in our times is definitely related to the proliferation of large numbers of guns we have more than 200 million guns already these are handguns we are not talking about rifles for hunting we are talking about guns already out there to the tune of 200 million and it is climbing every day so that soon we will have a handgun for every american man woman and child it is ridiculous and yet our bill does nothing to deal with the handgun provisions we are to be considering that in a separate bill this week so my constituents ask me are you serious about crime if you refuse to do anything about gun control are you serious they ask me if we are serious about a number of things that are happening down here we have a large number of people now who are offering themselves as experts on welfare reform that is going to be at the top of the discussion for the next 2 or 3 months welfare reform is on everybodys mind because they want to make certain we do not continue to waste the funds of our government by assisting individuals who are unworthy of it or individuals who could be working and taking care of poor children who ought to have their fathers taking care of them there are a number of reasons why the american people get excited and sometimes hysterical about welfare but my constituents ask me 2and i agree 100 percent with themif they are excited about government waste then why are we just excited about welfare reform why do we not reform some other things while we are at it they ask why dont you have what you would call subsidy reform we have subsidies coming from the federal government where the taxpayers are paying people to do various things and the taxpayers are assisting people who we say need assistance in the form of subsidies we have subsidies for farmers we pay farmers not to grow certain crops we assist farmers with loans of various kinds we have had this for years for decades nobody has proposed that we take a look at the waste in these programs and cut back on the waste there farmers are only 2 percent of the population they are less than 2 percent of the total population of the united states yet they absorb a large portion of the budget with these farm subsidy programs not only do we subsidize farmers with crop subsidies but recently the washington post indicated that there is a great source of waste a great deal of waste in the farmers home loan mortgage program the farmers lhome loan mortgage program costs the taxpayers 11 5 billion in loans that were forgiven loans that were delinquent and just written off and forgiven let me repeat that figure to every american citizen who is concerned about government waste the taxpayers of the united states gave the farmers of the united states 11 5 billionthat is not million this amount of money 11 5 billion was given to the farmers that is what happens when we forgive a loan they had 11 5 billion worth of loans they were not paying on them and for various reasons our department of agriculture forgave the loans gave the taxpayers money to the farmers this is just a small segment of the population the farmers only constitute 2 percent of the population we all appreciate our farmers we need the farmers american farmers are the greatest farmers in the world our agricultural system produces food cheaper than any other system but do the american people want to give away 11 5 billion when there are so many other needs that should be met the washington post ran a story on the farmers home loan mortgage giveaway on the front page of the paper they also cited in a very long article four millionaires who are farmers on the side millionaires who have not paid on their loans for 8 to 10 years the loans they had were just sitting there they were not paying on them nothing had been done to them one of the socalled farmers who was a millionaire had 26 million in assets in other words he had property and stocks and bonds and various things totaling 26 million and yet he was not made to pay on his loan he was delinquent on his loan so if we are interested in saving money why do we focus only on the recipients of welfare welfare is called aid to dependent children aid to families with dependent children so the families with children who for some reason cannot be taken care of for some reason they have to have government subsidy we are singling them out and zeroing in on them and saying we have to have welfare reform we have to save this money yes wherever there are people who are abusing this program we certainly should take some steps to deal with it but what about the farmers home loan mortgage are we going to take some steps to deal with the 11 5 billion are we going to put some of those people in jail who did not pay their loans are we going to make some effort to collect it what do we have to do do the taxpayers just have to give away 11 5 billion and nothing happens i expected that on the floor of the congress once the article appeared on the front page of the washington post that we would have numerous calls for an investigation i expected we would have calls for special hearings i expected that all of the freshmen who came last year 110 freshmen whose no 1 item was lowering cost of government at least half of them would call h2976 cc for some special effort to deal with the waste of 11 5 billion but it has not happened there are some very strange things that happen in this capitol very strange things go on in washington and i find it very difficult to explain them to my constituents i cannot explain why nobody is concerned with a giveaway of 11 5 billiorl but i am not surprised i am not shocked because for many months i stood on the floor of this house and asked the same questions about the savings and loan swindle the savings and loans have swindled the american people out of billions of dollars billions of dollars were guaranteed by the taxpayers the federal deposit insurance guaranteed the deposits in the savings and loan banks so that when they went bankrupt when they collapsed then taxpayer money had to be used to pay off the depositors stanford university predicts that before we are finally finished ith the savings and loan swindle the american taxpayers will be out 500 billion i did not say million i said b billion the savings and loan swindle which went on for the last 4 or 5 years will cost the american taxpayers at least 500 billion before all of the operations are completed and all of the various agencies that were set up to recover the money to take care of the depositors before it is all finished the taxpayers will be paying out and getting nothing in return 500 billion we get nothing in return for this money if you waste money in building an aircraft carrier that you do not need or waste money in building a submarine you do not need at least you have a piece of metal you have something to show for it in the case of the savings and loans the money is gone they say they were managed badly the real estate market collapsed but we have evidence it was not bad management in 90 percent of the cases there were business swindles business swindles where somebody would buy a piece of real estate and inflate the cost of it then sell it to somebody and inflate the cost of that finally everybody would get a loan and finally you have a piece of real estate costing a few thousand dollars that would be up to 1 million the bank gives a loan on that 1 million to build the building so you have a loan for the land which cost too much in the first place then you build a building and they did not complete the building so they never could occupy the building or get any income from the building the whole thing collapsed to the tune of 20 or 30 million they said that was mismanagement you cant call us crooks everybody knew in every stage of the transaction they were ripping off the taxpayers they were getting something they were not going to be able to pay back but in the final analysis the bank is left holding the bag the bank cannot meet its obligation the bank goes under and the american taxpayers come in in the form of the federal de posit insurance corporation and they bail out the bank which means that the american taxpayers are left holding the bag they have paid the bill and that will cost us 500 billion so while we are considering all of these ways to save money why are we not considering what is our next step in recovering some of the money lost through the savings and loans swindle why not have investigations why not have hearings why not take a look at where we are 5 or 6 years now into the discovery and the exposure of the massive swindles of the savings and loans associations nobody wants to talk about that here in this capitol people get hysterical about wasting money on children who cannot help themselves welfare dependent children but nobody wants to talk about the massive amounts that we wasted through the savings and loans swindle my constituents cannot understand it and i dont think anybody else in america really can understand it why arent our newspapers screaming loudly about this awful waste why arent our major leaders talking about the impact on the economy of that kind of waste you get nothing for it the farmers are given 11 5 billion you are getting nothing for it what is it doing for the total economy if the s l swindle costs us 500 billion we get nothing for it there is another way to spend our money why not invest in activities which produce jobs why not go back to where we were a year ago when the president offered the stimulus package that was going to create programs which would build bridges programs which would build highways programs which would provide services in terms of more head start youngsters increased assistance to build libraries and schools sixteen billion dollars just a mere 16 billion was dedicated to using the taxpayers money to invest in activities which would generate income not only would income be generated from the jobs that were created but the kinds of activities that the people who have the jobs were engaged in would be improving the economy increasing the possibility of other economic activity if you build better bridges and better roads and highways then the movement of goods is made more efficient if you give better training to students and job training to employees they are able to take more skilled jobs they earn more income the income taxes come back to the federal government so it is an investment the stimulus program of the president made more sense than any program we have had on the table in the last 2 years and yet that stimulus package was voted down by the senate we passed it in the house but it was later voted down my constituents want to know why dont we come forward with another stimulus package every week when i go home i am from new york so i am fortunate enough to be able to go home every week in fact i am so close to my constituents they want me to come home every night at least every week i am in the district and i get greeted at the door of my office by men who are asking when are the jobs coming congressman when are the jobs coming nothing that happens is more important than the creation of jobs to put it all together i have talked about the crime bill i t~lked about welfare reform i am talking about waste in the farmers home loan mortgage program i am talking about waste in the savings and loan swindle i would like to see us deal with all of that waste and use the taxpayers money instead in another direction of creating jobs of investing in activities which create jobs we dont talk enough about jobs in this house we dont talk enough about jobs in this capitol there is an assumption because we are in a capitalistic society the free market prevails that government plays a minor role in the creation of jobs while we recognize that jobs drive the economy and you cant have a working economy without jobs you cant have a working economy unless you have income generating activity because the income generating activity produces revenue and revenue is what government needs to survive on we dont recognize that we dont admit that the primary stimulus forthe capitalistic economy of america has been for the last 50 years the government after we ended world war ii which was an activity where there was a great stimulus but in our peacetime economy the greatest stimulus for the economy has always been the government the fact that we decided to go into an arms race with the soviet union meant that we poured billions of dollars into the defense industry and the defense industry was the motor of our economy what that defense industry motor showed us is that if you do not have defense as a motor to drive the economy if you do not create jobs via defense if the government does not stimulate jobs that way then it has to stimulate them some other way government must create jobs we must go forward understanding that one of our primary responsibilities as legislators one of the primary responsibilities of the decisionmakers here in this capitol is to create jobs people in my district do not understand why we do not spend more time talking about creating jobs why do we have lengthy discussions about crime and a crime bill and we do not recognize that people who have job who have hope of some day getting a job behave in ways which reduce crime the no 1 reason for crime is that people are seeking some income they are trying to get it without having to go through the regular channels and there are always crooks there are all ways criminals in every society but when you get a dramatic increase in the number of criminals when you have large percentages of the population participating in criminal activity there is something wrong with the society and the opportunities that the society is making available for the people of the society a society is a social construct which is created in order to improve over the stadte of nature if we were all out here in the jungle it would be survival of the fittest those whohavebread those who have bananas those who have food would have it taken from them by those who are stronger and the strongest would survive we do not want that all societie exist because they are trying to improve over the jungle over the state ofrnature so if a society exist as an improvement over a state of nature it means that it makes certain kinds of cortracts a compact with the individual that we are going to provide the opportunity in this construct of ours for everybody to survive everybody should have an opportunity to survive and survival in our times means everybody should have the opportunity to earn income legitimately everybody should have the opportunity to be able to work and get paid decent wages for their work which brings me ba ck to the question ofwelfare reform we are talking about welfare reform suddenly people who have never ever talked to a welfare recipient are declaring that they are experts or welfare plans are being offered by people who have never indicated any interest in poor people an ofa sudden there are all kinds of experts welfare reform should begin with the assumption that if you had jobs people would prefer those jobs and they would take those jobs and you would not have to subsidize them in some other way we will always have a need to subsidize people who are disabled people with disabilities some of those who cannot get jobs would have to be subsidized the elderly would have to be subsidized children with no parents would have to be subsidized but there are large numbers of people who are receiving aid from the government of some form food stamps public housing various kinds of subsidies because they cannot get a job which pays an income high enough to cover those necessities so if you want to deal with those necessfties then create jobs and let people just get a job earn income that is the simplest solution a lot of the social problems that result from people not having jobs a lot of tension cre ated that breaks families apart broken"],

close to the time that we have just heard from nelson mandela and i think all of us in this chamber felt a sense of pride in seeing how a bloodless revolution had taken place in south africa and to hear him say that while he was a prisoner in his cell the inspiration that he received and even today as he comes back as president the feeling that he has knowing that the united states of america a country that truly knew and understood what freedom was all about its willingness to fight and win it how he comes back here now depending on our support i think the sense that we feel as americans when we find other countries freedom in jeopardy that no matter what differences we have as democrats or republicans that we do feel a sense of pride when we see the countries waving their flags of democracy and to know that we played a part of that whether we are talking what happened in world war i or world war ii america has always been there and always stood as a symbol for justice and that is why i think that when for the first time they had elections in haiti it was the united states that was able to sit down with the military and to play a meaningful role in making certain that they for the first time will have elections my god with all of the problems that africanamericans have had in this country to be able to vote even our people never had to suffer what haitians did as they heroically went to the polls were being shot down but standing up and going right back again determined that they were going to vote when it settled and we looked arounol even though the candidate that was supported by the united states secretly did not win still there was for the first time in recent history or in the history of haiti a dulyelected person was elected as president and that was president aristide it was rough maybe he did not do some of the things that americans would like to see him do maybe he was not an american type of president maybe he was not what some of the republicans or democrats would have had running in their national convention but one thing was abundantly clear that as it related to what the haitian people want this man received an overwhelming vote something that we would say in our elections was indeed a mandate in the middle of the night a handful of military officers all of them trained in the united states as we might suspect went in collusion with the ruling class in haiti and together they were able to overthrow the presidency and to have this president run into exile it was no great surprise when president bush stood up and said not in this hemisphere do you do this it was president bush that said that no fragile democracy would have to fear ambitious generals in this hemisphere and behind him came our present president bill clinton and reiterated what america stood for oh there was a lot of talk as to what was in our national interest should we put our troops in harm there were reports from the cia that the man was in hospitals in countries that he never visited there wasa terrible thing going against his character and reputation but nevertheless we stood our guard and we said that we will go to governors island and we will sign an agreement and we will participate with civilized nations saying that aristide would return and democracy would return and america would be on the side of democracy and the whole world heard what we were saying the organization of american states heard what we were saying the united nations heard what we were saying and we said we wouldback it up well i do not know what is in our national interest i never told bush to say he was leader of the free world i never told this president to say that he was prepared to assume that responsibility i never wrote the new world order i never told fragile governments to depend on the united states of america to protect their freedom but it was said and we were proud of the fact that they said it then all of a sudden it appeared as though those who signed that agreement at governors island decided that they were not going to keep it and they chased away a battleship that was not just the american flag but the flag of all civilized nations in the international community and the military went on to kill the officers that were in the aristide cabinet to kill the people who were innocent to kill the people in the villages and the towns that supported aristide and even though the unpopularity continued even though there were certain people that continued to create something like we were dealing with a lunatic and not the head of a nation even though heads of nations who had met aristide said he was sane even though president clintonsaid that this man was responsible still the political drums continued to beat and people were saying that we should not go into haiti i will not go into the record but i know many of my members will go into the record to see how is it that we can change so fast politically and to determine what is in our national security interest this time under this president and why things were so different under another president and today we debate the question as to whether or not you you and you should supersede the intelligence of our military that are there in haiti and for you to tell them what time they have to come back home on november 30 1950 some zhinese whom i do not know saw fit to shoot me in north korea while i was there in the second infantry division as a part of united nations forces how we would have felt at a time when we were trying to defend the ground that we fought for that you who sent us there would tell us what time we had to get russian bombers were not the people out that assassinated the leader there in it just seems to me that there comes grenada actually in alliance with the a time where we have to take our party soviet union and wuld have indeed labels and put them aside and say that put military bombers on the ground if indeed the president republican or mr rangel i was democrat is indeed the commander in impressed with the argument that we chief why do we not leave it up to him had 20 white students that got caught why would we threaten our troops that up in grenada and we had to rescue are there in harms way and tell them them that moved me but cut it out that we have a better idea on the airport how many of us are

house to focus just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily

also the gentlewoman from connecticut for those words i have been active in the health care debate coming from houston tx because of serving on the education and labor committee but also the district i represent has 148 000 families who are working who are working at those jobs and their employers do not provide it one of the highest in the country these are people who are out working and they are not on welfare but they are working and yet they do not have it i rise this afternoon along with my colleagues to bring attention to the issue of universal coverage as the essential component of any health care reform that we do universal coverage is the key to lowering the cost and eliminating the cost shifting that has caused the skyrocketing of health care insurance premiums the people of the district that i am honored to represent are some of the hardest working people in this country yet that alarming 148 000 of working houstonians and working texans are from working families without health care coverage this is from the census data that we received from 1990 this is a prime example of what is wrong with our current system these people work and yet have no coverage we provide them with a system where it would be easier to stop working and qualify for medicaid yet these people continue to work because they know that their work is the way to have a better future for their families we should reward their work with health care and not punish them for working by saying you should go on medicaid an additional cost to both states and the federal government in a recent survey 74 percent of americans stated they support universal coverage the aflcio the aarp the ama with a combined membership of 46 million americans all agree that universal coverage is an essential component of health care along with that 74 percent almost threequarters of americans support universal coverage since we have reached some reasonable consensus that whatever bill passes needs to have universal coverage as its goal we must now look at the methods on how we can reach that care and how we can reach that goal first of all we can do nothing we can congress can adjourn in september or october and say let us leave the current system as it is and see what we can do and let the system correct itself well for many years presidents from harry truman to richard nixon have suggested national health care the problems were apparent then and all of a sudden the market changed a little bit and then congress went home and did not do anything so the problems continued because the only reason we have any health in the last year is because of the threat of additional government intervention so we can do nothing we would continue to see skyrocketing premium increases people would still risk losing their coverage and our national debt would continue to grow under the strain of increased health care spending we could enact a governmentsponsored plan whether it be called a single payer or any other government plan that would be provided and the federal government like in some of the countries that my colleagues have talked about would provide that insurance i have received so many calls like a lot of us in congress from our districts saying we know the system is broke but we do not want the government to provide it we dont know if the government can do anything right so we do not want to trust it to the government so we are not even advocating a single payer system although there will be a vote in the next few weeks on that here in the house because we do not want that government intervention because people do not necessarily trust the federal government the proposal has some distinct advantages though it would cover universal care it would take care of everyone universally but we also know the distrust that people have so let us discount the second mechanism for doing it we can require an individual mandate that is one of the proposals that was considered in the education and labor committee we could require everyone in the united states to provide their health care well before i was elected to congress in 1992 i served 20 years in the texas legislature and we tried to deal with automobile insurance with an individual mandate like most states in this country including west virginia it is a mandate that you have automobile liability insurance today on the roads in texas we still have 30 percent of those people who are on the road who have no liability insurance because of the high cost because of the availability for lots of different reasons so an individual mandate has not worked in automobile insurance even though we have criminal penalties in the state of texas and in some states you could lose your automobile for not having liability insurance but we still have a lot uninsured motorists so the individual mandate that is being proposed and will be voted on in the next few weeks here just will not work because it has not worked in other areas of insurance what we come back down to then is to continue the system we have today the success that we have and to build on the success we have of the employer employee cost sharing that is fairness that we have now almost 9 out of 10 of the people who have insurance in the united states today through the free market get it through their employer it is not with a mandate that would require some fair sharing between employers and employees even pizza hut that was talked about a few minutes ago they offer their employees now some type of health care they just do not want it mandated well i would like to see those minimum wage workers those parttime workers whether it be at pizza hut or mcdonalds or any other place be able to have that health care because 9 out of 10 of the people who have it now get it through their employers this keeps the free enterprise system that we have the benefits of it we have some of the highest quality health care in the world here in the united states we have people come from all over the world to our health care centers and particularly in houston tx people come from all over latin america to houston for health care they can pay for it though and they come and they pay very top dollar to come to the university of texas m d anderson or to many of our hospitals and our medical centers what we need to do is build on our current system and expand that for the people i represent that 148 000 families who work and do not have it to be able to access that high quality care that we can offer in houston and all over across the country it opens up our quality health care system we have now to those hard working americans that need it today most people who have their insurance get their insurance through their employer including members of congress and the president if we want to make sure that the system we provide also includes members of congress and the president we need to have some type of employer employee fair share we have a 70 30 system now in congress i will be honest with you before i was elected to congress and was in a business we had a union contract that required our employer to pay 100 percent so i may be one of the members of congress who had better health ckre before i was elected to congress but we had 100 percent coverage for dependents and we have a lot of quality care in the united states today but this builds on even the system that congress has and the president has it is cost sharing system this system for all americans was created by the market forces by free enterprise no one is mandated that requirement but it was created what we need to do is expand it to those other few people who have not been the beneficiaries of our quality system we have now it is very attractive to the best workers we want to make sure that it is attractive to all the workers by creating a system that is an extension of the marketcreated system we have now we are retaining the best of our current system the fairness let us make this work for all the health care system for every one in america in closing i would like to remind my colleagues who may be watching and also the american people that this is the last great peopleoriented debate we may have for this century the social policy we talked about social security in the thirties and medicare in the sixties now we are going to talk about health care for everyone in the ninetieshopefully by the time we leave here we will have it on the presidents deskthat will cover all americans when we talk to our children and our grandchildren 30 50 years from now maybe they will look back on it just like we today look back on the sixties and say how did congress have such a hard time passing medicare for our senior citizens or passing a basic pension system in the thirties for our senior citizens we cannot imagine 50 years later not having that or 30 years later not having it i think that 30 to 50 years from now we may be in the same situation my children and my grandchildren will be saying i cant believe that it took congress so long to do something we need to make sure that congress leaves with success that we do not simply make history that we make history on health care fairness not just a big political squabble we have here and we leave congress in october with some success and not just with a lot of hot air here other industrialized nations of the world as my colleagues have pointed out have taken this step because it is the right thing to do economically and politically there is a great future for all americans if we vote for health care reform that covers everyone if we pass a plan that contains universal coverage it will be a better life for all americans"], [0.5119709074497223,

africanamerican history month for those of you who perhaps are just joining us let me if i might lay out again that which we seek to do this evening not with a great deal of fanfare or fashion but with a great deal of sincerity as we attempt to chronicle and commemorate the lives of african ancestor americans over the history of this country and during this particular month you know one day unfortunately long after i am gone and many of you who are watching us this evening there will come a time in this country when we will not need a hyphen in the name that describes us that we will not necessarily be africanamerican or italianamerican or jewishamerican but that we will be americans because at that time and only at that time can we really say that america really did learn the true meaning of its creed that all people are created equal and that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights that time unfortunately continues to pass us by and it continues to dart just outside of our reach but it challenges us and it beckons us to come forward to be daring enough to believe that yes even in our own short lifetimes that if we try hard enough perhaps we can usher in that day when that hyphen is no longer needed let me if i might take a few words to set the stage that many people in this country of african ancestry stand on with regard to what we have considered for such a long time to be a struggle for civil rights and civil decency and human respect let me do it if i might by borrowing the words of frederick douglass who said to his countrymen and to his nation the whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle the conflict has been exciting agitating allabsorbing and for the time being putting all others to silence that it must do this or it does nothing for if there is no struggle there indeed is no progress those who favor and profess to favor freedom and yet at the same time depreciate agitation are essentially men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want rain without thunder or lightning they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters this struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be both moral and physical but it must in fact be a struggle power concedes nothing without demand it never did and it never will find out just what people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrongs which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those who they oppress men may not get all they pay for in this world but hey must certainly pay for all that they get if we are ever to free ourselves from the oppression and the wrongs and all the other things that have been heaped upon us that we must pay for their removal by our labor by our suffering and by our sacrifice so it was in 1894 with frederick douglass and so it is today in the 20th century with so many of us that challenge to do more and to be more and to give more and to want more and to find a way to make our bodies bridges even in our generations that others may run across regardless of their color regardless of their station in life regardless of their gender to be and become symbols of the america that we want so desperately to exist it was 1849 with frederick douglass the 20th century with us let me borrow again this time the words of samuel yette who in his book the choice writes the wood is all hewn the water all drawn the cotton all picked and the rails reach from coast to coast the ditches are all dug the dishes are all put away and only a few shoes remain to be shined thanks to old black folks and new fangled machines the sweat chores of the nation are done at the turn of this century it was with e b du bois who wrote in his classic work entitled the souls of black folk that the problems with the 20th century would in fact be the problem of the color line du bois words were prophetic and i argue that he uttered better than he knew for we are now in the last decade of the 20th century and we continue to see how race and racism have dominated every aspect of american life whether at home or abroad civil disorder and riots hate crimes on both sides of the color line disgust and distrust and mistrust are but a few of the many symptoms that are born as a result of that prophetic utterance at the turn of the century by du bois yes even 23 or 24 years ago after the rioting and civil unrest that took place in the late 1960s was the kerner commission still not even to their understanding living out that prophecy appointed by president johnson and then warning in its report to our nation that our nation was in fact moving toward two societies one black one white separate and unequal how cynical can one be america unfortunately and with a great deal of pain has too often been two societies a master slave anthology and the doctrine of white supremacy that was preexistent before the republic was founded have made and unfortunately too often kept this nation a nation of two societies so despite the great report of the kerner commission that is not where we were headed that is where we were already at and unfortunately in many respects are now and yet when you go and you pull off all of the layers of superficiality that cover us when you remove our masks and our methods of identification when you pull off those layers that we have put on that define us we will quickly discover that we are all in this nation pretty much the same in each of our racial groups we find that for the most part most of us are average we have a few geniuses and a liberal sprinkling of fools and that crude definition really does define where we are as racial groups because it says not only is it crude in its wording but it is also crude in its concept to believe that we are to accept somehow or another that there is something unique or different about us that makes us better than one group or better than the other group and yet even though sometimes many of us try to pull those layers off and to hide those masks and to get rid of those definitions we are charged with perhaps not being sincere enough or charged with not being patriotic enough or charged with stirring up polarization in talking as we must talk about the differences that divide this great nation we cannot if we are true to the lessons of the past ignore our problems and assume that through great and divine intervention they will be solved by themselves we were all taught that god helps those who help themselves and so if we are going to help ourselves it seems to me that we ought to be honest with ourselves and as we use as a backdrop as i mentioned earlier all the great problems and challenges of our times the deficit economics health care work trying to find ways to develop better educational systems we can talk about all of that but we must also talk about the problem that has been with us the longest this problem of race this great great problem of race that will challenge us in our own lifetime to find a way to get beyond it and to allow this nation to live out the true meaning of its creed we just have to talk about it my colleagues it is not as agonizing and as difficult once we begin the conversation as it is when we ignore it and we run behind shutters and closed doors and assume and allow the conversation to be carried by others we must do this and if necessary perhaps we must take the lessons from our youth who are finding ways to do it everyday who give hope to many of us that we are not as bad off as we think because they do not carry the same prejudices thank god they do not always have the same beliefs of superiority and inferiority thank god they do not have with them the burden and the weight that we carry with regard to race and so if we need a lesson and if we need direction sometimes and even on this issue perhaps we must look to the youth and what they are doing to get beyond that as my colleagues know life is a very infinite yet rather finite commodity we live in a world where everybody thinks it is infinite and that it is just going to go on and on we start life that way we do not think of life being fragile or finite we have got all the time in the world but as the years go by and as the problems remain with us it is really our creator that is calling for us to look at this finite commodity that has been bestowed to us that we call life and if we look at it as finite and recognize that it is fleeting perhaps we will find the urgency that we need to find the solutions to problems that have too often plagued us i do not know what else in the case of africanancestored americans we must do sometimes to exhibit our faith in the american dream or in the american possibility our fathers and our brothers have answered every call to bear arms to defend liberties that we ever had the bodies of black men alongside the bodies of white men are buried in the soil around this globe as witness and testimony to their desire like others to preserve a democracy that they never fully enjoyed our parents have begged on bended knees to be accorded the most elementary of human rights we have peacefully assembled and petitioned for the redress of our grievances we have sat in and slept in and stood in and studied in and prayed in we have waged our struggle as dr king taught nonviolently in the spirit of love appealed to the fundamental morality of the nation and to the nations conscience the result too often and unfortunately has been bloodied heads and broken limbs bombed churches and burnt homes assassinated leaders and murdered followers broken spirits and crippled hopes and yet we know that in the absence of hope is oftentimes the presence of despair it is out of that despair that we find a way to allow our neglect to breed and once neglect sets in we find that we have set up a society of class of standards a society of categories a society that defines and in defining oftentimes precludes we have failed then to recognize and understand the history of our nation and of our past and we are doomed in many respects to go back and to relearn it a few weeks from now in many cities towns and hamlets across this nation there will occur what many people refer to as the 39th anniversary of the supreme court decision in brown versus the board of topeka ks when on may 17 1954 nine men robed in black assembled on that historic day to announce their unanimous decision among the nations black citizens and among many of its whites there was indeed a celebration i am told that in black colleges classes were suspended and parties were hastily assembled at those institutions i was told as a child that there was dancing in the streets of richmond raleigh baltimore and washington and that shouts of victory echoed and reverberated throughout our communities because we saw in that decision in 1954 the possibility of a dawning of a new era we felt in the innermost parts of our hearts and our parents felt deep in the bowels of their existence that our nation was at last launched on an unalterable course with a firm determination that the american idea was in fact to become the american reality it is true that that 1954 supreme court ruling marked the watershed of our nations history with respect to the law of the land and that that verdict by a unanimous supreme court became the threshold of a launching of a new era in all areas of life for a people who had suffered endured and survived three centuries of slavery oppression depression denial and disprivilege from 1954 onward to the beginning of the decade of the 1970s many of us felt that all sectors of our society were determined indeed that they would overcome the legacy of the past but in 1969 a high ranking official advised the president of the united states in what was later to become known as the celebrated memorandum he said that blacks have made so much progress moving into the mainstream of american economics social and educational life that our nations policies with respect to the problems and the issues related to the status of black people ought to be accorded benign neglect i would submit to you and argue that in a period of just two decades through the 1970s and indeed through the 1980s that neglect once proposed as benign is now a neglect that is malignant yet we know because many of us are taught as children that when god closes one door he finds a way to open another and we in spite of that situation and that supreme court decision and the history that developed after that still believe that we still have the opportunity to set and make right again the course that we have been arguing over and over again as members of this race and as americans of different races the argument that dr king so passionately put forward that we must learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will surely perish together as fools that kind of admonition did not find its genesis with martin luther king jr allow me if i might before taking my seat to call to your attention a similar admonition in 1848 in a speech delivered in edwardsville il abraham lincoln addressed these words to his countrymen when you have succeeded in dehumanizing the negro when you have put him down and made it for him to be but as the beast of the field when you have extinguished his soul in this world and placed him where the ray of hope is blown out as in the darkness of the damned are you quite sure that the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you what constitutes the bulwark of our freedom and independence it is not our crown embattlements our bristling seacoast our army or our navy these are not our reliance against tyranny for all those may be turned against us without having made us weaker for the struggle our reliance is in the love of liberty which god has planted within us our reliance is in the spirit of freedom which prides itself as the heritage of all men in all lands everywhere destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism at your own doorstep ignore the chains of bondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them accustom to trample on the rights of others and you have lost the creative genius of your own independence and as such become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises among you lincolns words uttered over 140 years ago in many respects have gone unheeded poverty despair hunger homelessness deprivation disprivilege and a host of other ills still plague our society yet it is still that challenge of hope that calls us and cries out and gives us the belief that we can move beyond that anyway and that we can do it in our own generation in this finite commodity that we call life if all of us are prepared as booker t washington once said to simply cast our buckets down where we are to pick our own battlefields to save a life block by block to give back to others to take the time to reach out to want to talk to be prepared to confront problems to challenge ourselves to do more to believe in our nation and to respect human life so i believe and i suggest to you respectfully and humbly this evening that we must use as members of the house of representatives this occasion this glittering and official reminder of the success of our experience this house of representatives to recommit ourselves to sharing the dream the dream of martin luther king and fannie lou hammer the dream of washington dubois tubman and douglass the dream of all those nameless and faceless people who were black and white and jew and gentile and protestant and catholic but all who were americans who just decided to lay down and make their bodies bridges long ago that we might run across and get to 1993 and that we must do this not just by our prose or our poetry or even our prayers we must also do it by our action action which removes a large part of our distress by changing the conditions that first created it like dr james cheek i have not given up on the american ideal or the american possibility and i ask you my friends regardless of where you might be across this nation not to give up also i am convinced that this nation stands before the world as perhaps the last expression of a possibility of mankind developing a social order where justice is the supreme ruler and law is but its instrument where freedom is the dominant creed and order but its principal where equity is the common practice and fraternity the common human condition it is also my conviction that all of us who live at this special moment in time who respect this collective generation may in fact be the last generation to be afforded another chance another chance for us to balance the scales of justice and make them equal another chance for us to confront the doors of opportunity and make them open another chance for us to seize the chains of bondage and set and break them free it is a wonderful and glorious challenge but i would argue that we are a wonderful and glorious people and a nation of great opportunity and a nation that must find its strength in its diversity and understand the lessons of its past so we have come to commemorate africanamerican history month we argue that just as one day there will come a time when the hyphen will not be needed for africanamerican jewishamerican italianamerican asianamerican hispanicamerican that one day also there will not be a need to set aside a month but that the history of people of color of african ancestry and others will be so intimately interwoven and intertwined in the history of america that its celebration and its cause for rejoicing will occur every day of every week of every month and each and every year of our existence as a nation at this time i yield to the distinguished gentleman from arkansas who has joined us here for this special order this evening"],

bill i rise in support of the bill in my opinion it is the best criminal bill we have written since this congress started i am proud of it members should be proud of it because the crime bill is tough and it is also smart it is tough where we need to be tough it hit violent offenders with severe punishment measures it helps states build prison space to house their worst criminals bit it is also smart where we need to be smart it targets help on protecting children from violence and breaking cycles of crime and drugs and poverty it answers urgent pleas for communities overwhelmed by violence it sends them real solid help that will make a difference to millions of americans my colleagues this bill is historic it is a carefullyreasoned balance of punishment and prevention and we need both i urge every one of my colleagues to remember that balance as we debate the bill do not focus on one little part here or another little part there keep your eyes and most importantly your minds on the bigger picture see the grand strategy that holds this bill together we have already approved some of the titles in this bill cops on the beat drug treatment in prisons alternative punishments i will not address them other than to say they are a vital part of the overall package let me instead talk for a few minutes about the new parts of the bill we are considering on the punishment side the bill focuses on the most violent offenders violent repeat offenders who prey on the rest of us will face life imprisonment under the three strikes and you are out measure but this is not a mindless threetime loser law it is a smart law that takesreality into account we have carefully narrowed the crimes that qualify as strikes to target truly violent repeat offenders and we have added a review so that prisoners over 70 who are no longer dangerous can be released from prison this is not simply compassion it is hard common sense it will free up prison space for the most actively violent and dangerous criminals in a sense what the bill does is rationalize what we have been doing in the criminal justice system is it not absurd to have somebody serve five years in jail if they are caught for the first time in a nonviolent crime with a small amount of marijuana and have somebody who commits burglary after burglary after burglary serve virtually no time at all that is what we are trying to do here so we have a carefully drafted safety valve in the bill it allows but does not require the release of firsttime nonviolent drug offenders or their incarceration for 2 years and then their release for cooperating with the government that is another smart moderation of our tough mandatory minimum sentencing laws we must keep those laws i believe mandatory minimums are appropriate and proper but they should be applied intelligently and carefully to be aimed at the most violent the most repeating the worst criminals the ones who make us afraid not symbolically to take a 21yearold who has some marijuana plants in his house and say you get 5 years and the violent guy gets 2 that does not make sense we put 3 billion in this bill to help states build prisons these funds will help the states build prison space for violent criminals but the bill does not impose unnecessary federal mandates on the states it recognizes that they are ultimately the best judges of how to structure their systems of punishment and incarceration now let me turn to the other side of the balance the targeted funding for smart crime prevention programs the first time that this house and this congress is taking a look not only at punishing crime but at preventing it the bill contains 7 billion in federal support for programs to help root out the causes of crime these get right to the heart of urban and rural americas crime problems which are basically problems with our kids kids these days are pushed in two directions in many parts ofamerica rural suburban and urban they can take the life of crime or they can take the life of being a productive citizen if they take the life of crime we are going to punish them but before that path is taken we ought to use our funds intelligently to see that they become productive hardworking american citizens rather than criminals the ounce of prevention programs put more than 1 billion into communities for afterschool weekend and night programs to give kids a constructive place to hang out after the 3 oclock bell rings it will help children develop their minds and bodies in healthy ways and safe havens with programs in sports education and the arts there is a jobs program for the young people who are most at risk of falling into a life of crime is it not better if kids will take jobs than become criminals we can help we can make a difference in this bill we do let me close by repeating the bill is a careful balance i know that some of my colleagues on the right say that the policies of the sixties and seventies prove that prevention does not work and some on the left say that the crime programs of the eighties prove that punishment does not work these simplistic ritualistic positions miss the point the fact is that there are punishment programs that work and there are punishment programs that do not the same goes for prevention we need a law that combines the best of both and this bill does just that we must not bog down in partisan debate or in picking the parts away from the whole our constituents are anguished about the lack of safety they are pleading with us to do something and do something real do you have an ideology or partisan debate that means nothing to them get them the cops on the streets get them the prisons get them the tough punishment get them the afterschool programs the job training programs the drug treatment programs so that we can finally do something real in conclusion americans are fed up with violent crime they are scared they want help they want it now this bill sends them smart tough help america needs it and we should pass it"], [0.5116516947746277, 0.4883483052253723, 1, "i rise in opposition to the gekas amendment i realize that an increasing number of our colleagues find that there is political mileage in attacking the institution of which they are members and maligning their colleagues like the american officer in vietnam who uttered the explanation it was necessary to destroy the village in order to save it some of our colleagues believe that they must destroy this institution in order to get control of it this amendment is based on that premise proponents of the amendment argue that the present law and the bill before us is another example of congress passing laws for everyone else and carving out an exception for themselves the facts are that the independent counsel law and the bill before us do create some special exceptions but there is no such exception for members of congress the special exception is for the president vice president members of the presidents cabinet and officials of comparable rank high ranking members of the white house staff and key operatives of the presidents reelection efforts the special exception provides that when any of these officials are to be investigated for criminal wrongdoing the investigation should in every case be turned over to an investigator and if ultimately justified a prosecutor who is independent of the control and direction of the attorney general the basis for this exception is that the attorney general who is appointed by and closely associated with the president should not be investigating and prosecuting the president or other persons closely associated with the president this special exception applies to only about 60 individuals the other 250 million of us including the 535 members of congress are subject to no exceptional rules but are investigated and prosecuted by normal department of justice processes members of congress are subject to no special rules nor should we bq we are not appointed by the president under our system of separation of powers we do not work for him and he does not work for us there is not one shred of evidence tp suggest that department of justice investigators and prosecutors are reluctant to pursue allegations of criminal misconduct by members of congress in fact prosecutions of members of congress of both parties is a common occurrence regardless of which party controls the white house members of congress are already subject to investigation by independent counsel a fact which will be made even more explicit when this legislation is enacted it is not mandatory nor should it be if we need referral to an independent counsel to investigate members of congress in every case one would think that the four republican attorneys general we had between 1981 and 1993 would have found at least one occasion in which appointment of a special counsel was appropriate there have been none the fact is there is reason to believe that mandatory referral to an independent counsel would likely make prosecution of members of congress more subject to political manipulation not less under our present system an attorney general who personally takes charge of decisionmaking in the prosecution ofa member of congress is subject to special scrutiny and suspicion and should be if a political ally is involved the suspicion is of favoritism if an enemy the suspicion is of unfair persecution however if independent counsel referral is mandatory the personal intervention of the attorney general will be mandated not only mandated but mandated at a very early stage in the proceedings rather than thoroughly investigating allegations against a member of congress investigators will be required to turn the matter over to the politically appointed attorney general at a very preliminary stage for decision on the future of the investigation suppose that at this point the attorney general decides that there is no basis for further investigation even if this is based on lack of evidence and not on political manipulation it makes the process more suspect and prosecution of members of congress much more difficult cases which should be and could be made if the regular procedures were followed may not be made if the case is prematurely taken out of the hands of career investigators and prosecutors furthermore in cases which are initially rejected by the attorney general while it is theoretically possible that additional irformation could be produced leading to a decision that an independent counsel should be appointed this is unlikely it is unlikely because the best source of such information is not anonymous phone calls to the attorney general but justice department investigators however once an attorney general finds that in the words of the statute that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted a pretty clear message is sent to career investigators and prosecutors that the matter is closed the shrill voices clamoring for mandatory referral of cases involving members of congress to an independent counsel seem to be proclaiming that the independent counsel process is superior to the normal methods of bringing federal prosecutions and that members should always be investigated and prosecuted by this superior process the fact of the matter is the independent counsel process is not the best process for prosecuting federal crimes the best process the one most likbly to lead to conviction where conviction is warranted is the normal criminal justice procedure under which all but about 60 individuals in our nation are investigated and prosecuted it is only in the case of this handful of individuals that we should and must resort to the extraordinary processes of the indepdendent counsel an inherently inferior process for most cases but one that is superior for the special circumstances of these few individuals we heard much talk yesterday about coverage of members versus cover for members the fact is the committee bill and the bryant amendment provide appropriate coverage of members cover for members is found not in those proposals but in the republican proposals to free members in every case from the timetested and proven investigative and prosecutorial practices of the department of justice the republicans would instead force every case into a decisionmaking process nbt designed for and often totally unsuited for the circumstances presented"], [0.5115096569061279, 0.48849034309387207, 1, "i yield myself the balance of my time i think there are several reasons to vote against the gilman amendment the first one simply is that the unitedstates policy has been decided we are not going to change that tonight let us not send a confused signal about what american policy is going to be the president has decided march 31 he did that after consultation with members of the congress he has set the date tomorrow we are going to vote on the defense department appropriation bill all of us will vote or almost all of us will vote for that bill that bill provides for march 31 we are going to say tomorrow and we are going to enact into law march now let us not come along tonight and say advice to the president of january 31 that is not a clear signal at all unitedstates policy has been decided we are going to confirm it tomorrow and there is no sense muddying the waters here and giving another date tonight the second reason we should vote against the gilman amendment is we ought not to micromanage now in some ways this policy debate tonight approaches the ridiculous we are arguing about 60 days whether unitedstates troops should come out january 31 or march the congress of the united states has an appiopriate role to play we help the president formulate policy and we have done that but it is the presidents responsibility to implement policy and let us let the president implement the policy the policy is a policy of gradual disengagement let us not argue over january 31 or march 31 let the president implement the policy let us be clear next that the gilman resolution will not bring our troops home sooner it is a sense of congress resolution members should be very clear about that point this substitute does not change policy it will only send a confused and a mixed signal around the world next the united states does have a mission in somalia for these next several months a unitedstates presence there will give more time for negotiations it will give more time for the political process to take root and there are encouraging signs about that today it will give us time for the humanitarian mission to be completed and it will give the united nations time to find troops to replace unitedstates forces nobody here can assure anybody that if we wait until march 31 all these things will be accomplished all we are doing is trying to provide a reasonable chance for the somalis for the united nations for the negotiations to succeed by staying longer we will leave somalia pointed towards survival rather than towards chaos finally we should support the hamilton resolution and defeat the gilman resolution because the president has made a commitment to our u n partners to stay until march 31 the unitedstates senate now overwhelmingly has agreed to that commitment and we will agree to it tomorrow in the defense department conference report i have heard it said here i want to send a signal to the president the problem with that is when we vote tonight we send a signal to a lot of other persons not just the president we send a signal tonight to the united nations we send a signal tonight to the factions in somalia we send a signal tonight to ethiopia and to eritrea that are trying to help us in the peace negotiations if the gilman resolution is approved that message will be that the united states has lost hope for somalia once we send that signal our u n partners will withdraw at least as fast as we do the conflict will resume somalia returns to chaos and united states forces i think will be at greater risk that is not the signal we want to send by supporting my resolution and rejecting the gilman substitute we will send a far better signal that signal is that the united states will not be intimidated that signal is that we cannot solve all of the problems of somalia but we will meet our commitments and we will give them a reasonable chance to succeed i rise in support of the gilman amendment i approach this issue very cautiously because i believe foreign policy is an area where the president must be the leader of all americans i have defended a previous administrations right to formulate and enact policies designed to roll back soviet expansion in our hemisphere too much intervention by congress does weaken the presidents ability to conduct foreign policy but in my tenure in congress i have also never known a secretary of defense that would deny our troops the equipment they needed because he was more concerned with public opinion than his troops i have also never worked with an administration that excuses its action by saying we inherited these problems thats simply pathetic let us put this miserable excuse behind us once and for all george bush never envisioned a longterm american presence in somalia george bush resisted attempts by the united nations to draw us deeper into rebuilding somalia does somalia need to be rebuilt yes it does but george bush realized that american troops are the wrong tool for rebuilding somalia he intended our forces to stabilize the terrible humanitarian situation and bring our troops home and that is all the withdrawal of our troops from somalia by march 31 has nothing to do with any strategic or logistical reality and everything to do with the president trying to save face well mr president i think the world has figured out our credibility in somalia is zero so lets bring our troops home as quickly as possible let me just close by suggesting the president get himself some new foreign policy advisors its clear that his current ones are not up to the task of conducting a foreign policy in transition after all a president willing to hire a former reagan administration official as a spokesman ought to be willing to get some competent foreign policy
