american history there he would give one of our nations defining speeches amazingly president lincolns address was not even the main event of that day edward everett the former president of harvard was the events main speaker spending 2 hours lecturing about ancient greece and how that society honored their fallen soldiers everett later wrote i should be glad if i could flatter myself that i came as near to the central idea of the occasion in 2 hours as president lincoln did in 2 minutes in the 21 2 minutes lincoln spoke he did more than honor our fallen soldiers in 272 eloquent words he reminded us that we live in a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal he asked whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure in his address the president also issued a challenge to his contemporaries and to generations of americans thereafter saying it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced he concluded our nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that a government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from this earth in his address i believe president lincoln was asking the question what do we as americans mean when we say all of us are created equal in the over 150 years since the gettysburg address we have had our struggles but we have also had our successes we have suffered the supreme courts decision in plessy v ferguson but we also experienced the redemption of brown v board of education we allowed the women of this nation to remain disenfranchised for more than a century but we also passed the 19th amendment which affirmed womens right to vote we lived through the travesties of jim crow but we also celebrated the passage of the civil rights act we watched trumans executive action desegregate our military we passed dont ask dont telland repealed itand doma but we also have witnessed the legalization of samesex marriage in 37 states and the district of columbia all of these examples serve as reminders of the difficulties in ensuring equality for all but they also demonstrate a nation that has responded to challenge and has been reborn each time we have come a little closer to living up to the ideal that all of us are created equal to paraphrase dr king the moral arc of our nation may be long but as history shows us it bends towards justice equality and freedom in times of dissonance inequality and injustice great leaders like lincoln have reminded us of our nations true purpose equality on lincolns birthday lets rededicate ourselves to our nations unfinished work lets ensure that women get equal pay for equal work lets recognize all love as equal and extend marriage rights to all of our citizens once and for all lets strengthen the voting rights act to guarantee that no one is disenfranchised and all americans have access to this fundamental right lets finish the

lets allow our neighbors and friends who put in a full days work whether in the mailroom or the boardroom to provide their families with a living wage lincoln modestly believed that no one would long remember his address that day at gettysburg but we do remember and strive to honor all those who have sacrificed and struggledand continue to strugglefor equality because we believe as dr king spoke

debating a final conference report on h r 22 the surface transportation reauthorization and reform act of 2015 which provides for what used to be the customary sixyear reauthorization of surface transportation programs to provide certainty and stability to the needed effort to repair rebuild and revitalize the nations crumbling infrastructure the senate amendment to the conference report on h r 22 the surface transportation reauthorization and reform act of 2015 passed by a vote of 6534 nearly a twothirds majority while the version of the bill passed by the house version of the bill which included two jackson lee amendments passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 36364 i reluctantly support this emergency but temporary measure because as the department of transportation has reported if we do not act now highway trust fund balances will reach dangerously low levels by november 20 and result in a reduction of payments to states by an average of 28 percent many states have already canceled or delayed planned construction projects threatening 700 000 thousands of jobs including 106 100 jobs in my home state of texas the highway trust fund was created in 1956 during the eisenhower administration to help finance construction of the interstate highway system which modernized the nations transportation infrastructure and was instrumental in making the united states the worlds dominant economic power for two generations our national leaders then understood that investing in our roads and bridges strengthened our economy created millions of goodpaying jobs and improved the quality of life for all americans it is currently composed of two accounts that fund federalaid highway and transit projects built by states federal funding from the trust fund accounts for a major portion of state transportation spending the highway trust fund is financed by gasoline and diesel taxes which until the last decade produced a steady increase in revenues sufficient to accommodate increased levels of spending on highway and transit projects however those tax rates18 4 cents gallon federal tax on gasoline and a 24 4 cents gallon tax on diesel fuelhave remained unchanged since 1993 and were not indexed to inflation so the value of those revenues has eroded over the years and combined with the fact that vehicles have been getting increasingly better mileage the revenues deposited into the highway trust fund beginning last decade have not kept pace with highway and transit spending from the trust fund consequently since 2008 congress has periodically had to transfer at the 11th hour general treasury revenues into the trust fund to pay for authorized highway and transit spending levels and avoid a funding shortfall the total amount to date is more than 74 billion obviously this practice is economically inefficient and injects uncertainty in the highway construction plans projects and schedules of state and local transportation agencies not to mention the anxiety it causes to workers and businesses who economic livelihood is dependent on those projects the last transportation authorized by congress for 4 years or more safetealu expired on september 30 2009 at the end of fy 2009 because congress and the administration could not agree to a new reauthorization it was necessary to resort to stopgap temporary extensions on no less than eight occasions spanning a period of 910 days before congress finally enacted the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 act on july 6 2012 which reauthorized highway and transportation programs through fiscal year 2014 a little more than two years or until september 30 2014 map21 was intended as a shortterm measure to give congress and the administration breathing room to reach agreement on a longterm reauthorization bill yet as mr levin the ranking member of the ways and means committee has often pointed out since gaining the majority in 2010 our republican colleagues have failed to take any action to sustain the highway trust fund over the longterm and shore up vital infrastructure projects and has not held even a single hearing on financing options for the highway trust fund it is long past time for this congress and especially the house majority to focus on the real problems and challenges facing the american people and one of the biggest of those challenges is ensuring that america has a transportation policy and the infrastructure needed to compete and win in the global economy of the 21 st century to do that we have to extend the reauthorization of current transportation programs and to authorize the transfer of the funds to the highway trust fund needed to fund authorized construction projects and keep 700 000 workers including 106 100 in texas on the job but that is only a start and just a part of our job the real work that needs to be done in the remaining days of this congress is to reach an agreement on h r 22

plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers

main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so once again i urge members to support change and stand with veterans not the bureaucrats and the special interest groups and the status quo i urge

the car and set out on a trip to visit one of our countrys historic national parks whether it is to see the stunning valleys of the grand canyon or the towering stone faces etched into mt rushmore tens of millions of families arrive at national park destinations each year as some may know the national park service has implemented a policy allowing parks to ban the sale of bottled water and only bottled water at park concessions i understand that the park service is concerned about waste left behind by visitors we all agree that protecting our national parks is a laudable goal however banning the sale of bottled water is not the best way to go about it in blocking the sale of bottled water at our parks we are depriving millions of americans access to a healthy and necessary beverage that park visitors rely on this is especially true in the hot summer months families who dont own expensive camping equipment and arent experienced hikers and climbers will be surprised to find out that they cant buy their child a bottle of water at one of our national parks nineteen national parks have adopted or plan to adopt a bottled water ban this includes the grand canyon national park temperatures at the grand canyon just this week will top 100 degrees visitors who may have forgotten or have run out of water could be put at risk of dehydration banning bottled water defies common sense even the park service admits that the ban could affect visitor safety and eliminates the healthiest choice for bottled drinks leaving sugary drinks as a primary alternative the policy runs counter to the park services own healthy parks healthy people initiative which urges visitors to make healthy food choices because remember bottled water and only bottled water is banned from being sold at concessions some argue that the ban is necessary to reduce waste but the national park service has confirmed that participating parks havent been able to determine if the policy works to start we know parks dont separately analyze recycled waste visitors leave behind parks simply cant say whether the ban has worked it is also worth noting that studies conducted on similar water bans show that they arent effective in reducing waste a study in the american journal of public health found the bottled water bans on college campuses had unintended consequences eliminating bottled water did not in fact reduce waste but actually led to a spike in sales and increased shipments of packaged beverages we all support efforts to protect our parks all we ask today is that the national park

followed first responders from neighboring jurisdictions including jersey city responded to help with response and recovery efforts not long after these devastating attacks concerns were raised about the interoperability gaps that existed between responders on that deadly september day the 9111 commission identified improving interoperable communications at all levels of government as a pressing recommendation they emphasized that both technology and governance are critical components of interoperable solutions and recognized dhs as the federal agency responsible for spearheading such an effort though nationwide over 13 billion has been invested in achieving interoperable communications at the state and local level we are still not there at dhs over 430 million has been invested into communication capabilities for its 123 000 radio users since 2003 however in 2012 the departments own top watchdog the office of inspector general found that dhs personnel do not have reliable interoperable communications for daily operations planned events and emergencies in may of 2014 the inspector general testified before the homeland security subcommittee that out of 479 field radios that attempted to communicate on a specific channel only one user could do so that is a 99 8 percent failure rate too often communication failures are attributed to technology or a lack of resources
