3136 a bill to extend the operating authority of the overseas private investment corporation to september 30 1985 to remove certain restrictions which tend to hamper its effectiveness and to broaden the scope of its services it is a rare occasion that we have the opportunity to vote on legislation for a program that plays a key role in strengthening our relationships with the some 100 nations of the developing world provides needed support for the unitedstates business community in the highly competitive international marketplace generates growth and new jobs in the domestic economy and does these things without using the taxpayers money the reagan administration is committed to the encouragement of private sector enterprise as the most effective means for fostering continuing economic growth and selfsufficiency in the nations of the developing world at the same time the administration is well aware that increased unitedstates private investment abroad will be a critical factor in sustaining our own economic growth traditionally the major source of capital for support of badly needed economic and social programs in the developing countries has been governmenttogovernment assistance or concesslonal aid but the need to combat inflation and to reinvigorate industrialized economies has led to severe cutbacks not only in the united states but in other countries as well and this decline comes at a time when the needs of the third world are accelerating the hard fact of the matter is that their needs today are far in excess of capacity of public assistance programs and thus there is a widening development gapg which must be filled the most immediate and practical solution is the encouragement of more private sector investment and virtually all of the friendly developing countries are actively seeking unitedstates investment foreign investment is not a oneway street obviously host countries can derive many benefits from the infusion of foreign capital which creates new jobs brings with it management expertise and training generates tax revenues and helps people to help themselves but it is also true that the type of investment supported by the opic political risk insurance and 11nance programs contributes to our own growth by providing access to new markets for goods and services creating job opportunities and making positive contribution to our balance of payments in short eveyone can come up a winner in spite of all this there are those who contend that all unitedstates companies investing abroad are suspect and that they are exporting jobs reducing our export capacity and neglecting the need for domestic growth certainly there have been cases in which unitedstates companies have sought out cheap labor but i would point out that opic maintains a rigid screening process and provides support only for the kind of enterprise that will help the host country and return positive benefit to our own economny in fact the job export theory has been largely refuted in a series of nine studies made by business international inc an independent research publishing and advisory organization based in new york city which recently published the effects of unitedstates corporate foreign investment 107079 this study involved 104 unitedstates companies with combined worldwide sales of 459 billion of which 202 billion were made to overseas customers in 1979 they accounted for 28 billion in unitedstates exports and their gross worldwide investment at the end of 1979 was 240 billion of which 70 percent was in the united states perhaps the most significant fact of all revealed by a study of unitedstates manufacturing employment during the period 197079 showed that the coinpanies in the study increased their domestic payrolls by 27 8 percent while unitedstates manufacturers as a whole increased by 4 4 percent the gross trade surplus for the manufacturing companies included in the sample rose from 5 5 billion in 1970 to 18 4 billion in highlighting the positive impact of private investment abroad and opics role in unitedstates foreign economic policy the wal street journal in an article on april 11 of this year said income in the form of dividends interest management fees royalties and other payments from earlier unitedstates foreign lnvestnent allows the united states today to show a small current account surplus despite a large balance of trade payment deficit during the past decade the annual earnings from unitedstates direct foreign investments have risen five fold from 8 2 billion in 1970 to an estimated 41 billion in 1981 opic has a unique and important role in the foreign assistance effort through its encouragement of the kind of investment that serves two objectivesdevelopment abroad and the growth of unitedstates business at home relating this more specifically to opic and its performance since its renewal in 1978 i wot~ld point out that it has insured or financed 337 projects in 58 developing nations with an estimated total investment of more than 4 6 billion opics participation includes an aggregate of 2 9 billion of insurance issued and commitments for 227 million in investment guaranties and 15 5 million in direct loans to enterprises involving small business it is interesting to note that this record was achieved despite congressional imposition of a number of restrictions that would be modified or removed by the current legislative proposal h r to round out the picture of these 337 projects projections for their first 5 years of operation are that they will create 57 000 new host country jobs generate annual tax revenues of more than 532 million and account for net foreign exchange benefits of 1 5 billion from the unitedstates standpoint they are expected to generate more than 3 4 billion in direct exports over the 5year period and to create some 56 000 added manyears of unitedstates employment the corporation closed fiscal 1980 in the strongest position in its history with total assets of 699 million gross revenues amounted to 76 1 million and net income after operating expenses was 65 8 million projections for fiscal 1981 indicate continued growth and an even stronger position and again i would remind you that this small organizationonly 125 people in allcontinues to operate without the use of appropriated funds all of us recognize the growing challenges of an increasingly interdependent world and the need for innovative approaches that will provide mutual benefit both for the developing world and the industrialized nations we need new markets access to new energy sources and scarce materials if we are to sustain our own growth the developing nations need capital expertise training and all the other elements which will help them to help themselves in a changing and competitive world opic is an outstanding example of what can be accomplished through a working partnership between the private sector and the government i urge my colleagues to support h r 3136 which will continue a highly successful and critically important program at a time when it is needed most"], [1.049041748046875e-05, 0.49998950958251953, 0, "the amendment to the jones proposal before us is pure and simple a taxpayers amendment it was promulgated by my colleague mr green and i with the idea in mind that the american taxpayer is being asked to pay even higher taxes in exchange for dubious and questionable increases in our defense spending our amendment will cut defense outlays by 4 billion in each of the upcoming 3 fiscal years from the amount specified in the com mittee budget and will reduce budget authority in each of these years by 16 billion importantly however the amendment also permits us to cut 4 billion from the tax hike assumed in the committee budget for individuals and corporations it goes without saying that our weapons programs should be put together in a rational and thoughtful way and yet there is a perception out there a growing suspicion if you will that americans are not receiving a dollars worth of defense for each dollar spent years of haphazard defense policy and lack of a strong coordinated leadership have left this country with a defense department increasingly perceived as bloated bureaucratic and wasteful the gentleman from new york and i are concerned that the federal government is engineering a major shift of national resources to the military but without a fiscally prudent outline and course while most domestic programs face deep cuts major cost overruns on already expensive weapons systems are almost routinely accepted by congress and administration clearly to continue on this course will not serve the longterm interests of this country and indeed will needlessly drain scarce resources required by the rest of our recession ridden economy today more than ever we need to let our pentagon blanners know that we are watching them and that we expect them to carefully monitor and streamline weapons cost today a fighter plane cost 30 million a battle tank 2 5 million an attack submarine 580 million this is to hay nothing abut the 3 5 billion price tag for a new aircraft carrier even when adjusted for inflation the costs of these weapons are easily doubledigit multiples of their world war ii and korean war predecessors in all the pentagon is spending some 84 billion in the current year as their share of the defense budget for weapons procurement and military reserach and development left unchecked this figure could rise to 600 billion in the years 1983 through 1987 and yet despite the enormous price tag associated with our procurement programs there has been little debate on the committee bills effect on our economy right now faced with deep recession and unmet human needs at home i am concerned that the committee when discussing our strategic needs did not analyze defense spending in broad perspective i am not sure that my coileagues understood that a strong economy is needed for a strong defense and that largescale diversions of the nations economic resources into the military sector could result in a continued economic decline and an increasing inability to meet the basic needs of the american people i am concerned that the defense figure approved by the committee is indicative of a general lack of commitment toward stopping duplicative and unnecessary defense programs and policies particularly in the area of procurement where cost overruns spring up like dandelions a nation with a crumbling infrastructure increasing unemployment increasing poverty and a shakey economy can ill afford the costs of an unchecked 242 billion buildup the nations security and strength are not defined only through military powers but also through the vitality of our domestic economy and society and yet unless we force our m~ihtary planners to make real choices in our strategic programs the administrations defense plan and the largescale deficits it necessitates may serve to thwart any attempt we make to improve our defenses by blindly throwing money at them without thought to the fiscal consequences our amendment addresses itself to this problem it will allow us not to increase taxes as much in order to achieve the same deficit levels as the committees budget our amendment will permit us t6 preserve the contract we made with the american people last year to reduce their personal taxes by a full 10 percent by insuring the committee budget thus provides my colleague and i i think both agree that a significant reduction in the tax rates given individuals is necessary in order to revitalize the economy by producing noninflationary economic growth a 10percent cut is necessary in order to return confidence and encourage economic activity president kennedy once said that an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits truer words were never spoken and could not be more applicable today on this amendment to continue to allow our military leaders to plan and spend for every strategic weapons program unchecked and without real oversight in the pentagon is not responsible and is in conjunction with higher taxes the wrong formula for economic recovery our primary defense i urge my colleagues support for this important amendment should any of you have any doubts about how 16 billion in budget authority can be trimmed from our defenses without undermining our na tional security needs i submit the following suggestions for savingsthat can be achieved by trimming waste and by incorporating responsible changes in military procurement and management policies the general accounting office in over 100 reports in the last year has illustrated in irrefutable fashion the enormous savings that are possible billions could be spared for instance through the consolidation of support activities at bases close to each other so that administrative functions such as payroll transportation trash and sewage disposal could be streamlined still less costly ways to budget and provision spares for new weapon systemscould be used to make them more effective and less costly and save millions in the process in addition according to the gao work still needs to be done to improve the management of naval fleet supplies and spare parts and in the area of recouping administrative costs of foreign military sales millions of dollars are still written off in former service members debts and according to the gao future losses can easily be cut as recently as last month the agency reported that actions are still needed to reduce schedule slippages and cost overgrowth on contracts for naval ship overhauls and changes are urgently needed to improve the effectiveness and acquisition management of certain weapons systems a congressional republican study committee report in 1981 also cited several general accounting office reports which estimate that the pentagon could save several billion dollars annually savings of 1 billion could be realized for instance if the air force installed one rather than two computer systems at their bases to perform administrative and operating functions in addition according to the report over onehalf of a billion dollars is apparently being wasted by increased government costs due to fraud inadequate accounting and procedural control in the armys military district of washingtons finance and accounting office complementing these findings are the recommendations made by noted author william w kaufman a high level consultant to defense secretaries from robert mcnamara to harold brown that defense could be reduced safely by 32 billion in authority this year and 11 billion in outlays his latest study setting national priorities published by the brookings institution recommends among other suggestions canceling the pershing ii and groundlaunched cruise mis iles for deployment in europe in favor of the trident 2 submarine missiles among additional savings cited by mr kaufman are limiting the administrations planned expansion of the nations civil defense program and canceling the mx and b1 bombers many of you may also be acquainted with the april 25 washington post article by staff writer walter pincus in which he notes seven additional ways in which the defense budget could be cut by 10 billion in outlays according to pincus savings of several hundred million dollars are possible by halting the two questionable costly army antitank programsthe apache attack helicopter and the bradley fighting vehicles and 3 billion in outlays by cutting back on purchases of excessive munitions to be used in wartime and the rate at which nonessential defense equipment is overhauled mr green and i and the other members of a northeastmidwest coalition highlighted earlier this year the over 40 billion in budget authority that could be realized in fiscal year 1983 by substituting provem reliable less costly weapons for proposed weapons systems that were plagued by cost overruns and unreliable testing history some of our suggestions included a cutback in the purchase of m2 infantry fighting vehicles the substituting of some conventional submarines for new nuclear ones a restructuring of the proposed naval modernization of naval air defenses a less ambitious procurement schedule for the m1 tank and the elimination of the viper antitank rocket additional savings could easily be attainable by reducing service members overpayments and scaling back subsidies of alcohol and tobacco at commissaries other weapons with large cost overruns that could be targeted for reductions are the patriot air defense system and the copperhead laserguided 155mm artillery shell both are victims of the armys inability to manage dozens of new programs at the same time rather than having the time and resources to refine and adequately test fewer new weapons slowly over an extended period taken together all these recommendations could save billions and they illustrate how we can save billions of dollars in the defense budget while still funding necessary programs for a stronger defense it is important to make clear that i am by no means insinuating that these suggestions should be adopted in their entirety or that even anyone of them is necessarily preferable to other ideas to reduce outlays what should be apparent and i have emphasized this time and time again is that as we are asked to increase defense spending by over 1 trillion over the next 5 years it is even more important for the members of this body to examine closely these recommendations for properly allocating defense revenues our amendment provides the ideal opportunity for us to force the pentagon to begin to look at these ways to reduce outlays and in the process to manage more efficiently its fiscal resources i am supplying mr chairman a list of gao reports as referred to earlier and a list of suggested areas for examination to expand on and amplify my earlier remarks"],

sufficient to meet the genuine needs of the coast guard in recent years coast guard responsibilities have increased continually due to new recreational and industrial activities within themarine environment and an increased emphasis mandated by the congress on fisheries and drug law enforcement operations the unitedstates government and the american people turn to the coast guard for protection against illegal acts by foreign fishermen or drug smugglers we expect the coast guard to operate and maintain the largest system of short and longrange aids to navigation in the world we depend on the coast guard for search and rescue assistance in time of maritime emergency it is the coast guard which provides the last line of defense against major spills of oil or hazardous

pacific fisheries enforcement and 60 pe cent of its atlantic area fisheries enforcement due to a shortage of funds numerous scheduled coast guard patrols have had to be canceled delayed or prematurely terminated due to vessel condition or maintenance problems coast guard training particularly in marine law enforcement is seriously deficient the administrations original budget request for the coast

i rise in support of the house budget resolution and in opposition to grammlatta i believe that the house budget committee resolution is a more honest a more fair and a more economically sound budget package than the grammlatta package on the merits the grammlatta substitute should be defeated moreover because of the procedure dictated by the rule we have adopted we must first reject grammlatta in order to have a vote on the budget committees resolution if we adopt grammlatta we will never have the opportunity to vote on the budget committee resolution in rejecting grammlatta we must reject president reagans appeal to support it as we all know he favors grammlatta personally i regret that we must oppose president reagan on this issue he is not only very popular at the moment but we all share his desire to improve our economy we also share his general goals of slowing the growth of federal spending of providing the american people with some tax relief and of promoting savings and investment all of which are important in getting our economy back on track unfortunately these commonly shared goals will not be advanced by the grammlatta substitute i say that first because grammlatta proposes an excessively large budget deficit of 38 billion the presidents original budget proposal had an even larger deficit of 45 billion in both cases unrealistic economic assumptions are being used which means that the deficit will be much larger than those proposals project for example the presidents budget assumes an inflation rate of 7 2 percent for fiscal year 1982 is there anyone in this house who really be lieves the inflation rate will be that low next year much as i would like to believe it i do not and neither do virtually all objective observers the presidents budget further assumes that in fiscal year 1982 the cost of government borrowing will average 8 9 percent is there anyone in this house who really believes that the interest rates will be that low next year much as i would like to believe it i do not and neither do virtually all objective observers the unpleasant truth is that these assumptions have no relationship to economic realities we know that inflation and interest rates will be higher than that next year and that therefore the deficit projected by the president is unrealistically low the american people did not vote in 1980 for this large a deficit they wanted more progress toward a balanced budget and the house budget committee resolution which projects a deficit of 25 billion would provide us with that progress moreover the budget committee resolution uses realistic economic assumptions in projecting a smaller defict it assumes an inflation rate of 9 9 percent next year and an interest rate of 12 percent these are honest projections and accordingly we can have greater confidence in the deficit which the resolution projects as a candidate for president mr reagan argued forcefully that federal deficits substantially contribute to inflation the american people believed him and most of us pledged to reduce if not eliminate such deficits how then can he and we support a budget such as grammlatta which projects so large a defict beyond imposing so large a deficit the grammlatta substitute is fatally deficient for other reasons the spending cuts it proposes are unfair falling especially hard on the most vulnerable in our society moreover in many cases these cuts would simply shift costs to local or state budgets or actually increase costs to society by eliminating essential investments consider these examples elemerktary and secondary education programs would be cut by 25 percent a deep reduction which would have to be picked up by state and local taxpayers or result in a loss of essential help for the handicapped and disadvantaged eligibility and support for college loans and grants would be sharply reduced making it impossible for large numbers of lower and middleincome students to attend school vital job training programs would be eliminated resulting in greater welfare costs many health programs would be cut by 25 percent affecting medical care for the elderly and veterans among others economic development programs of great importance to job development in the northeast and other distressed areas would be eliminated support for rail service would be eliminated and there would be substantial cuts in other mass transit programs these are just a few examples but they serve to illustrate the inequity and shortsightedness of the presidents approach other deep cuts would affect items like child nutrition legal services for the poor energy assistance housing and many other programs which seek to address real needs we knowv that budget restraint will require cuts in many programs including ones which help our constituents and region but these proposals lack balance and vision there is no safety net despite the administrations claim to the contrary with such deep cuts one might well ask why the presidents budget deficit is so large the answer is that there are substantial increases projected for defense spending and there is a significant loss of revenucs projected because of his tax cut let me say at this point that i support some increases in defense spending as well as some reductions in the tax burden however i believe that the size and direction of the presidents defense and tax proposals are unfair and economically unsound for fiscal year 1982 there is little or no difference between the defense proposals of the president and the house budget committee but if we consider the presidents projections for military spending in the outyears the increases are truly astounding and pose serious risks for our economy over a period of 4 years the president proposes to increase military spending from its current level of 162 billion to 304 billion this means that military expenditures which now represent 24 percent of our total budget would rise to 33 percent the magnitude of this military buildup becomes clearer when one considers that after adjusting for inflation it would represent a buildup three times as large as the one that took place during the vietnam war one of the chief causes of our current inflation was president johnsons refusal to raise taxes to pay for the costs of that military buildup while i believe that some increases are necessary in our defense budget we can hardly afford to wreck our economy by throwing money at the pentagon it cannot absorb that much money efficiently we must be more selective in identifying our security priorities spending the money where necessary but not wasting it finally the presidents tax proposal is unfair and based on a faulty premise it is unfair because under kemproth the foundation of the presidents tax proposal most of the benefits would go to upperincome americans the president does not dispute this but he argues that upperincome americans will save and invest most of their benefits and this will boost the economy thereby helping all americans and that is the faulty premise while we do need more savings and investment there is no reason to believe such benefits will be saved or invested in fact economic history demonstrates that most of them will be spent and this will be even more true today when the expectation of inflation is still with us if this is true demand will increase pushing prices up still higher instead of assuming people will save and invest the tax bill should reward people including lowand middleincome people who actually do save or invest i would like to support president reagan i share his concern for our economy and his general goals unfortunately the particulars of his program will not achieve the economic goals we all wish to achieve therefore i urge my colleagues to reject the grammlatta substitute and to support the budget committees resolution it features a much lower deficit a tax cut which is more fairly allocated and targeted to promote savings and investment and because that tax cut is more modest it will restore some funds for absolutely vital domestic programs"], [6.979703903198242e-05,

this action and have consponsored a reso lution in the house of representatives which recognizes the contributions of the senior citizens who make up an everincreasing segmentof our society eighteen percent of pennsylvanias population is over 60 years of age thanks to better health care better housing better nutrition and better community services americans are living longer today than at any other time in our history these improvements in the quality of life for older americans were brought about to a large degree by the federal government previous administrations realized that the federal government along with society had a moral obligation to insure that the elderly could lead safe and productive lives these programs are indeed necessary since according to the 1980 census one out of six older americans lives on an income below the poverty level when president reagan outlined his program for economic recovery before a joint session of congress and the american people on february 18 1981 he stated we will continue to fulfill the obligations which spring from our national conscience those who through no fault of their own must depend on the rest of us the poverty stricken the disabled the elderly all of those with true need can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exempt from any cuts what has happened to that promise only 4 months after president reagan made that pledge the administrationbacked omnibus reconciliation act was passed the effect of this legislation on senior citizens programs was severe food stamps were cut 16 percent social security and railroad civil service and military retirement were cut 20 percent medicare and medicaid were cut 10 percent sharp reductions planned for social security were shelved only after a massive protest by recipients however the administration was not content to make life harder for those to whom hardship was no stranger it set out to comfort the already comfortable through a tax bill which favors the wealthy the american people were assured by the administration that this program of reductions in funds for social programs and taxbreaks for the wealthy would pull the economy out of its slump and provide benefits for all americans where are we nearly 1 year after this program was enacted the jobless rate now stands at 9 4 percent nationwidethe highest rate since the great depression this figure represents an increase of 2 5 million people on the jobless roles since last july when the republican program was enacted instead of reevaluating a program that obviously is not working the administration is simply offering the american people more of the same in its budget proposals for fiscal year 1983 the sum of the new budget proposals would mean further misery particularly for the elderly poor let me cite a few examples of the impact of some of these proposals according to the congressional budget office 2 5 million elderly who now receive food stamps would lose their benefits altogether while another 66 percent would have their benefits reduced food stamp assistance would be considered as income when determining eligibility for housing assistance similarly energy assistance would be counted as income when determining eligibility for food stamps the cumulative effect of these three proposals alone would leave many lowincome elderly with a catch22 dilemma do they choose to eat stay warm or have adequate housing unfortunately the litany of hardships the admininstrations proposals if enacted would impose continues medicare would be cut by another 2 4 billion medicaid would be cut by an additional 1 9 bilion supplemental security income would be reduced 286 million in 1982 and 1 1 billion in 1987 programs which are funded under the older americans act would have their funding levels reduced from 986 million in 1982 to 652 1 million in 1983 the title v employment program would be abolished according to the national council on aging this would cause 80 000 lowincome elderly individuals to lose jobs which enable them to be independent as well as provide valuable community service apparently undaunted by massive public support for social security the administration appears ready to push for cuts in the program once again it supported a measure adopted by the senate budget committee which called for 40 billion in unspecified cuts in social security the administration prefers to leave pinpointing exactly where the reductions will be to a special commission which will make its report after the november election the message that has been coming through to me loud and clear from the senior citizens in my district is that they simply cannot sustain any further cutbacks in the programs on which they relysome for the basic necessities of lifefood shelter and health care this administration has not kept its promise to protect the social safety net of programs which benefit the needy and the elderly this pledge has apparently been lost in the enthusiasm for a stronger defense a stubborn commitment to an economic program that is not working and the need to lower the huge deficit brought about as a result of the administrations economic policies i too favor a strong national defense and a lowered deficit however these goals can be achieved in ways other than by making further cuts in needed social programs in my view an essential first step in lowering the deficit is to cancel the third year of the kemprothreagan tax cut the military budget also needs to be given as careful scrutiny as the social programs which have already borne their share of budget cuts we must restore the american peoples shaken faith in their government as a vehicle for social and economic justice we cannot abandon the elderly and truly needy members of our socitey it would be unconscionable to attempt to balance the federal budget at the expense of americas elderly citizens"], [8.64565372467041e-05,

percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the war on poverty there is still great misery and poverty in this country the reagan administration understands that you cannot give somebody something without ultimately destroying the recipient of your gift the reagan administration is determined to get the government out of the way and to encourage the individuals to be responsible for their own destiny with an assist for all those who are genuinely incapable of caring for themselves as i go about the 4th district in arizona i find the people expressing new confidence and new hope sure things are difficult right now they say but it is going to be better when i visit the young people i find them sober and serious and determined to make progress on their own just this spring an amazing thing has occurred organized labor has voluntarily accepted a reduction in wages and fringe benefits in order to keep their industries in a better competitive position the presidents proposal to improve our defense capability is under constant attack in the media but the people i talk withthe workers and the taxpayers and the homeowners and the businessmenhave a clear understanding that in order to survive we must be strong last week one of my supporters and political advisers cautioned me about being too bold and forthright in my support of president reagan president reagans popularity is way down you know he said the polls tell us so a great many people do not approve of what he is doing it would be better if you talked more about eldon rudd and less about ronald reagan well my friends ronald reagan is the only leader we have who has demonstrated an understanding of the problems which confront us and a determination to do something about them he is taking his lumps in the press but on the scorecard that really countsthat is the one kept in the heart of every loyal americani think ronald reagan is earning high marks and because i believe he is right when he says we must reduce taxeswe must reduce federal spendingwe must reduce federal regulationi shall continue to support him at every opportunity because i too believe those things are right for this nation the american people have the courage and the understanding and the wisdom and the commonsense to recognize that to return to the ways of the past would lead to ultimate disaster"], [9.545683860778809e-05, 0.4999045431613922, 1, "i rise in opposition to the substitute offered by congressman larta to the house omnibus reconciliation bill it is clear upon examination of the republican substitutes line item cuts combined with the anticipated proposal to consolidate nearly 100 categorical programs into 7 block grants that the purported safety net was and is nothing more than a shama metaphorical ploy designed to veil the devastating reductions in people programs last january the administration affirmed that the truly needy would be protected on may 7 when the specifics of the bipartisan budget proposal were debated it became excruciatingly apparent that the sanctimonious promises of the administration were hollow the sacred cows as the administration coined the safety net features of the budget were as deliberately stripped of funding as those initially targeted dramatic social security reductions a cap on food stamps and medicaid elimination of school milk programs dramatic reduction of federal employee and retirement benefits termination of job training for our youth suddenly became part and parcel of the dart game called balancing the budget regrettably the house authorizing committees were forced to follow the dictates of reconciliation and subtracted billions of dollars from programs which assisted the elderly people with moderate incomes the middle class women and the youth of our country not only did the house committees comply with the mandates of the adopted budget resolution but they exceeded those cuts what we did not do nor were we required to do was cut the line items identical to those the administration recommended in lieu of applause for our reluctant but cooperative efforts the democrats have been charged with chicanery and deception opposition to the republican substitute is not merely a sour grapes phenomenon the grammlatta bill will abrogate the authority and function of the house authorizing committees i do not exaggerate when i charge that adoption of these amendments constitute a blatant threat to our entire checks and balances system the integrity of the legislative process is dramatically threatened today the republican substitute undermines the integrity of the budget process and eliminates due process in the consideration of major policy changes the argument stating that the republican amendment must be considered to preserve the spirit of the legislative process is supremely ironic this amendment does more to undermine the original intent of our legislative e process than any strategy i have witnessed whether our constituents are 50 miles away or 500 miles away they are our primary consideration if we fail to provide a semblance of a quality existence for them then we have failed not only as legislators as democrats as republicans but as human beings let me now comment on some specifies of the grammlatta substitute my first cause for concern are the unconscionable cuts in social security there are over 1 6 million people in the state of ohio now receiving social security833 085 are retired workers 132 675 are disabled workers 170 663 spouse benefits 209 838 are children and 256 687 are widows and widowersalmost 60 percent of these people are 72 and over the elimination of the minimum benefit and the student benefit will impose a severe hardship on hundreds and thousands of american families the minimum benefit this benefit is awarded to workers who would receive a lesser amount based on their low earnings record or shortterm or sporadic work history more than 3 1 million americans will see their benefits taken away almost immediately the average individual will see his or her minimum benefits cut back by 40 percent and who are these people of the individuals affected by this reagan proposal 85 percent are women who are the mothers grandmothers and greatgrandmothers of this nation twothirds of those affected are between the ages of 70 and 90 and most do not qualify for ssi which excludes those with more than 1 500 in additional assets indeed most of the minimumbenefit recipients have no other sources of income900 000 of them are elderly women these people are not double dippers the number of those receiving another form of pension with their social security benefit is minimalthe ssa says that only 12 percent of minimum beneficiaries have public pensions and of these only 6 percent have federal pensions esa data shows that 22 percent are receiving a pension of less than 300 a month at least 2 5 million persons receiving the minimum are ineligible for ssi and no individual who receives more than 258 would get any ssithey are not quite poor enough those who do qualify may well choose impoverishment over the stigma of applying for welfare currently onehalf of minimum beneficiaries eligible for ssi choose not to apply for welfare now with respect to the elimination of the student benefit this benefit is presently extended to children of retired deceased or disabled workers if they are in school full time nearly 34 000 students received these benefits6 300 are in cuyahoga county the administrationsr proposal would eliminate awards to the new students starting in june 1982 and would reduce payment of the benefits to current students by 25 percent each year thiswould mean that 700 000 current recipients would have their benefits reduced by 25 percent each year and 500 000 students who would be newly entitled would be totally eliminated almost twothirds of all student benefits went to students in families with annual income under 15 000 and 32 percent of all benefits went to students of families with incomes under 5 000 additionally cuts by the administration to the chief student loan and grant programs will make it impossible or near impossible for these students to get a college education let me remind my colleagues the social security insurance plan is a contract between our government and those who paid into the system it is a scared trust fund depended upon by millions of americans this trust fund should not be cominglect with the unified budget historically this was never the case until 1969 when changes allowed the trust fund to be analyzed as part of an overall budget even so that trust fund belongs to the contributors not to those members of congress or the president who would break the contributors contract by removing billions of dollars worth of funds in order to meet the cut desired by the president it is an improper and i believe illegal means to an end in effect our older americans who rely on this system and women who are living on social security and are attempting to send their children to college will see reduced benefits would any other trust fund or insurance policy in our country be dealt with so deviously would any insurance company dare reduce benefits carte blanche without proper consultation with its customers our senior citizens are the lifelong customers of our social security system they are being cut out of the trust fund without an opportunity to defend their desires furthermore i am disturbed by the use of optimistic assumptions for the administrations tax proposals while pessimistic assumptions are being made regarding social security how do these economic assumptions interface with the social security proposals earlier this month the aging committees task force of social security and women which i chair held hearings on the impact of the administrations proposed social security cuts the large majority of witnesses expressed the belief that the social security program was not in a state of bankruptcyindeed its problem is the shortterm deficit i am deeply distressed that congress is willing to take money out of this trust fund which gives economic security for our people and take this money and put it into the hands of the armament industry our social security trust fund is being used to pay for guns tanks bombs and carriers in amounts so tremendous that even the defense department acknowledges it will have a hard time spending the billion of dollars of increase it will receive from the checks of our elderly"], [9.796023368835449e-05, 0.49990203976631165, 0, "this nation has long recognized that a viable domestic uranium industry is not only an integral part of the nuclear fuel cycle but also vital to assure our national defense and security unfortunately the domestic industrys continued viability is being seriously threatened by unnecessary overregulation and by our rapidly increasing dependency on imported uranium the domestic uranium industrys ability to compete with foreign producers is seriously jeopardized because of unwarranted and costly regulatory impositions for example nrc has adopted onerous radon flux regulations known as the uranium mill licensing requirements which will cost the domestic industry a billion or more dollars but which nrc itself admits are unjustified indeed in a recent memorandum highlevel agency staff declared that the risk from radon flux from tailing is immeasurable and insignificant the nrc is now threatening to revoke new mexicos regulatory jurisdiction because the state after a lengthy hearing concluded that nrc staff was correct and the commissions approach was unsupported and impracticable it is poor policy and poor government to impose billiondollar requirements which the agency admits are not justified on a critical and already beleaguered industry the language reported by the conference committee should remedy this problem by requiring epa and nrc to assure that regulatory burdens are not out of proportion to benefits and that pertinent factors such as economic costs and the significance of health risks are properly weighed in setting agency requirements while this will likely require epa and nrc to reconsider and reformulate at least some of their actions uranium mills will remain subject to nrc or agreement state licensing control in the interim while epa and nrc develop a supportable approach the public health will thus continue to be fully protected the conferees have also appropriately clarified that nrc cannot revoke a state program without a hearing and that mill tailings are regulated either by a state under the agreement states program or by nrc but not by both in short there is no dual jurisdiction i also wish to emphasize that it obviously makes no sense for the rules to keep changing on operators and doe epa should issue reasonable standards assuming arguendo that further standards beyond those specified in 10 cfr part 20 are required and nrc should not then adopt reasonable requirements nrc should not first act then epa and then nrc again i read the language reported by the conferees as consistent with this interpretation however a puzzling statement crept into the conference report which makes a confusing attempt to sanctify nrcs precipitous action in issuing standards in advance of epa standards i certainly hope that this is not construed as somehow overriding the words of the statute or as giving our imprimatur to bureaucratic turmoil and lack of sound administrative practices the conferees have also taken some steps to address our rapidly developing dependence on imported uranium i realize that some have urged that any action which may favor our domestic industry is contrary to interests in free trade however the uranium industry has long been viewed as vital to our national security and energy independence moreover canada and other uranium exporting countries have wellknown policies to support the prices of their uranium through control over export contracts these policies are intended to subsidize their own producers and consumers at the expense of importing countries such as the united states they are enforced in part by laws restricting or penalizing the applicability of american antitrust requirements since the price and availability of imported uranium is regulated by foreign governments it is unfair and unwise not only from the perspective of our domestic producers but also from the perspective of our consumers to allow foreign uranium suppliers to dominate the american market so as to repder our domestic industry incapable of servicing our needs by way of illustration i ask unanimous consent that a few excerpts from some canadian and australian documents suggesting the policies pursued by those countries be included in the record excerpts from statement by the honorable donald s macdonald minister of energy mines and resources on canadas uranium policy september 5 1974 under existing uranium export policies the regulating agencies are required prior to issuing an export license to examine contracts with respect to implications of such matters as international safeguards the relationship between contacting parties price and volumes of sales to the export market and reserves and rate of exploitation while recognizing that considerable time may elapse between negotiating a sale and completing a contract the board will require producers to submit within 90 days of the acceptance of an offer by a purchaser documentation giving the base pricing quantity and delivery conditions emphasis added excerpts from notes for an address by the honorable marc lalande minister of energy mines and resources to the canadian electrical association here i would like to comment briefly on the federal governments basic export policy whether it involves electricity or any other source of energy we are strongly in favour of exporting energy provided the canadian market has first been fully and completely served and provided the shortand mediumterm expansion prospects of that market have been accurately established and an adequate safety margin has been retained to cover future needs beyond this we are strongly encouraging producers to export their surplus as determined by the national energy board they would thus help the united states to further minimize their dependence on oil imported from overseas such exports must however be priced high enough so that canadian producers can realize a profit such profits should then enable them to keep the prices they charge to canadian consumers at a reasonable level emphasis added excerpts from australias mineral resourcesdevelopment and policies 1981 the fundamental objective of controls is to protect the national interest among other things export controls are used where necessary to ensure fair and reasonable world market prices are achieved adequate supplies are available for the domestic market international and strategic obligations are met and the governments nuclear safeguard and physical protection requirements on exports are met emphasis added although i fully support the provisions in the authorization bill i be lieve that more must be done to sustain a domestic uranium industry ca pable of holding down prices and fulfilling our domestic needs in time of crises in particular current doe opproaches to uranium enrichment suth as the fixed tails assay and the split tails policy must be modified these doe policies unfairly depress the demand for uranium and amount to a costly and hidden tax on the domestic uranium industry and its employees for the purpose of subsidizing the doe enrichment program including does development of gas centrifuge technology doe should abandon these burdensome policies immediately this would expand the demand for uranium and put some of the thousands of unemployed uranium miners in new mexico and other states back to work"]]}
