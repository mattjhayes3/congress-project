would restore a provision for the critical foreign languages program in the secretarys discretionary fund of the department of education while the second would establish presidential awards of excellence in the teaching of foreign languages i am very pleased to be joined by representative sawyer in introducing the first amendment and equally pleased to have your support and that of the ranking minority member for both measures the critical foreign languages program of the secretarys discretionary fund is a small but important component of the federal governments involvement in foreign language education at the elementary and secondary levels for the past 3 years this program has been allocated 2 million each year mostly for grants to fund a total of 70 foreign language programs at the elementary and secondary levels the types of programs funded are those that are superior in and of themselves or are good models mostly in the areas of teacher training and curriculum development for critical foreign languages this category officially includes a total of over 100 languages though there is a narrower category of the 11 most critical and a large portion of the programs are actually in just 3 languages chinese japanese and arabic there is a concentration on these three because among those languages critical to our national security and economic prosperity there is a special need for programs in these three most of the programs to date have been cooperative ventures between local schools and institutions of higher education in addition some money has gone directly to state education associations to aid in the development of statewide plans for foreign language curriculums the critical languages program has become one of the most effective among those funded by the secretarys discretionary fund and as i mentioned one of the best foreign language programs at the federal level nonetheless it was deleted from the school improvement act by the committee largely as i understand because the discretionary fund is mostly intended to fund math and science programs and because an option to spend money on foreign language programs would still be retained however historically nearly all the money in the discretionary fund not specifically earmarked for foreign languages has been used to meet pressing math and science needs while i applaud the increased attention to foreign languages recently demonstrated by congress in h r 3 the critical foreign languages program of the secretarys discretionary fund is much more valuable than its small funding level of approximately 2 million would suggest it is the only part of title iii specifically earmarked for foreign languages and departmental staff have ensured that these funds are used for innovative and solid programs eliminating critical foreign languages from the discretionary fund would mean that little or no title ii money would go toward foreign languages and a small but important portion of the federal governments foreign language program would be lost my amendment would add foreign languages to math and science as an eligible area for funding under section 2130 national programs of title iicritical skills improvement of the school improvement act it would in addition set aside 25 percent of the funds in national programs specifically for the improvement and expansion of instruction in critical foreign languages this amendment restores the status quo for this program before the drafting of h r 5 and would not increase the cost of h r 5 because funds would be taken out of those authorized for the entire program this amendment would guarantee the continuation of a small but important program focusing on languages essential to our security and economic wellbeing and therefore constitute a contribution to our country far in excess of the resources devoted to it my second measure would establish a system of presidential awards for teaching excellence in foreign languages in order to focus national attention on the critical need for foreign language teachers few people would i believe deny that such a pressing need exists in a recent survey by the national association of state supervisors of foreign language teachers 57 percent of the states responding reported a current shortage and almost 65 percent expect to experience such a shortage in the near future while considerable attention has been devoted to decreasing the shortage of teachers in other areas notably math and science important to our security and economic prosperity relatively little effort has been made to remediate a comparably great shortage of foreign language teachers my amendment which would add a new section 2135 to title iicritical skills improvement would take a small but significant step toward correcting this major deficiency in oureducational system a total of 104 awards would be made by the president to elementary and secondary teachers who have demonstrated outstanding teaching qualifications in the field of foreign languages at least one elementary and one secondary school teacher from each state as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico would be selected thereby ensuring attention across the nation to foreign language teachers the cost of this program would be 1 million for fiscal year 1988 with the necessary sums being allocated in subsequent years while this amendment would not actually create a new federal foreign language program these presidential awards would significantly add to the prestige of good foreign language teachers and thereby motivate a greater number of more highly qualified persons to become and remain foreign language teachers this would have significant value beyond the relatively small cost of the program as it is now difficult for many school districts across the country to attract and retain highly qualified foreign language instructors in general as i noted foreign language instruction has been neglected in favor of other critical skills given that the ease of learning a second language is inversely proportional to age it is discouraging to find that only 1 percent of students in our elementary schools receive any kind of foreign language training moreover a 198283 survey showed that only 21 3 percent of all high school students were enrolled in foreign language courses 88 percent of which were in spanish and french these distressing facts attest to the need to devote much more and higher quality attention to foreign languages especially at the elementary and secondary levels this measure would dramatically increase the prestige of teaching foreign languages and therefore help improve instruction in and attention to foreign languages in the crucial years to come global interdependency is a fact of life and america can no longer exist in this world wearing linguistic blinders the investment in our future national security and prosperity represented by these two measures is very minimal yet the stakes are high we must act now to put our foreign language and international education system back on track and these amendments represent small but significant steps in this direction i therefore urge the support of my colleagues for both measures"], [0.4913199543952942, 0.5086800456047058, 1, "i rise in strong support of the conference report i rise in strong support of the conference report on h r 2470 the medicare catastrophic protection act which we are considering today i want to commend my colleagues mr waxmn and mr stark of california and mr pepper of florida for their outstanding leadership on this critical issue h f 2470 is an excellent stop forward in addressing the dire need for comprehensive health insurance among older americans whrjn a severe illness strikes the emotional and physical burdens are great and the stress on loth the victim and family are tremendous but t q threat of exorbitant medical bills and diminished ctv t may exact an even greater burden the medicare program was enacted in 1965 to provide the elderly with acute health insurance coverage until then many seniors lived with the constant fear that a serious illness could leave them destitute unfortunately the increasing cost of health care and utilization of services has left large gaps in medicares coverage h r 2470 addresses some of these gaps and enhances the medicare package last year i held a field hearing in my district in northeast philadelphia my constituents told me about the critical need for protection from catastrophic costs of longterm care and extended hospital stays i heard horror stories from families who were pushed into poverty because they tried to provide adequate health care for their older parents and relatives h r 2470 provides the foundation of a sound plan for comprehensive coverage first h r 2470 establishes a longterm care commission to examine options for a longterm care plan in the future this is an essernval step in the development of a workable plan for longterm care insurance the commission is required to report to congress after 6 months and make recommendations for federal policy on longterm care in addition the medicare catastrophic protection act establishes a respite care program to give relief to the families and unpaid caregivers of the infirm elderly under the program families would be eligible for up to 80 of hours paid inhome care per year for an elder i113863 ly medicare beneficiary who is unable to perform at least three activities of daily living a respite care program will preserve the informal caregiving system which provides the majority of longterm care to medicare beneficiaries at home by giving these families temporary relief from the strain of caregiving we will help to maintain this important support network h r 2470 also addresses the need for solutions to the problem of spousal impoverishment which results when one spouse enters a nursing home often the spouse remaining in the community is left with little to live on this legislation changes medicaid eligibility standards under this bill nursing home residents would qualify for medicaid while the spouse at home could retain up to 12 000 in liquid assets and the couples joint income up to 122 percent of the federal poverty levelcurrently 786 per month both the respite care program and the spousal improverishment provisions represent basic steps forward in the development of federal policy to address the longterm care needs of older americans while we will continue to develop a workable longtermcare policy h r 2470 sets up several essential measures to address the acute catastrophic needs of older americans first the bill would provide for the coverage of extended hospital stays after the payment of a single annual deductibleestimated to be 580 in 1989 under the current medicare program beneficiaries must pay the deductible for each spell of illness whenever they enter the hospital these deductibles mount quickly and easily devour a fixed income h r 2470 would also cap overall part b expenses fo physician visits and routine lab tests victimsof chronic illness visit the doctor frequently medicare allows coverage of 80 percent of physician charges after the payment of the annual 75 deductible however multiplying bills from frequent visits to the doctor are not uncommnn h r 2470 would cap outofpocket medicare charges after the limit is met medicareallowed charges would be covered in full the bill also increases coverage under medicare for skilled nursing facility care and eliminates the current requirement that the beneficiary be hospitalized for 3 days prior to entering the nursing home under this legislation the beneficiary would pay 20 percent of the charges for the first 8 days after that the charges would be covered for the remainder of their stay in addition h r 2470 establishes a program for coverage of prescription drug expenses some of the elderlys highest outofpocket charges result from their prescription drug expenses for many families the cost of the drugs can mean the difference between skipping a meal or not paying the phone bill the catastrophic prescription drug plan under h r 2470 would be phased in beginning in 1991 the plan would pay 50 percent of the charges for prescription drug expenses after the payment of an annual 600 deductible medicares share would increase to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter another important measure included in h r 2470 would provide clarification of the medicare home health care benefit under part a of the program under h r 2470 beneficiaries would be allowed daily home health visits for up to 38 days this care could be extended if a physician recertified the care as medically necessary in sum this legislation offers older americans a comprehensive acute catastrophic insurance package and the beginning of a sound longterm care policy it is an excellent step forward in addressing the dire need for comprehensive health insurance for all older americans once again i want to commend my colleague from florida mr pepper for his outstanding

fiscal years 1988 and 1989 this bill authorizes appropriations of 3 903 603 000 for 1988 and 4 596 109 000 for 1989 for the department of state the unitedstates information agency the board for international broadcasting and the asia foundation as chairman of the select committee on narcotics abuse and control i particularly want to offer my support for part d of title 1 of the bill relating to international narcotics control section 161 would require a minimum of two drug enforcement administration agents to be assigned to any unitedstates mission abroad where the secretary of state has determined that a dea office is needed the foreign affairs committee report on h r 1777 notes that this provision is intended to apply to existing dea posts abroad as well as to those opened after enactment of the bill the committee is concerned that the dea office in cairo where one agent is now responsible not only for egypt but also almost 30 other african countries be increased to at least two agents i agree wholeheartedly with this provision for reasons of safety and efficiency the assignment of no less than two dea agents to our dea offices abroad makes good sense section 162 broadens the existing requirement for quarterly state department reports to congress on the progress of the camarena case to include information on the case involving dea agent victor cortez jr too in february 1985 dea agent enrique camarena salazar and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar were kidnapped and murdered in mexico the foreign relations authorization act for fiscal years 1986 and 1987 included a requirement for quarterly reports to congress on the progress of the camarena investigation subsequently in august 1986 victor cortez was detained and tortured for several hours by mexican officials section 162 will require the quarterly reports on the camarena case to include information as well on the progress made in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the cortez incident in testimony presented to the select committee on narcotics on march 25 of this year the state department said that a major suspect in the camarena killing was arrested in mexico recently nonetheless in the more than 2 years since the camarena and zavala murders there have been no prosecutions or convictions the lack of any real progress in this case justifies the continuing requirement for regular reports to congress on the camarena investigation and the intervening arrest and torture of victor cortez warrants the inclusion in this bill of the added requirement for periodic information on the progress of the cortez case section 163 of the bill requires that unitedstates missions in major illicit drug producing and trafficking nations give greater priority to the negotiation and implementation of effective extradition treaties to ensure that drug traffickers can be extradited to the united states for prosecution as the report by the foreign affairs committee points out extradition of a countrys citizens to stand trial in the united states on drug charges is a difficult bilateral issue to pursue ideally a country should have the means to investigate arrest prosecute and incarcerate its own nationals who are involved in illicit drug trafficking a major goal of unitedstates international narcotics control assistance should be to help major drug producing and transit nations develop this capacity extradition however can be an important tool the gentleman from new york who serves as the select committees ranking minority member and i recently returned from colombia where we represented the speaker at the meeting of the andean parliament we found that the government of colombia is virtually paralyzed in its narcotics enforcement efforts the drug trafficking organizations have declared war on colombia and are engaged in a campaign of fear violence and intimidation to prevent he government from moving against them arrests of major traffickers are rarely made because of fear and intimidation the civilian courts in colombia are unable to prosecute major drug traffickers the colombian supreme court has invalidated the authority for the military courts to prosecute drug cases extradition to the united states was the threat traffickers feared most but the colombian supreme court recently struck down the resolution implementing the extradition treaty with the united states colombia is but one example of a country that is unable to effectively prosecute drug dealers on its own similar problems exist in bolivia peru and other nations as well under these circumstances the negotiation and implementation of effective extradition treaties should be a high priority of our missions in major drug producing and trafficking countries as we try to help them develop their own investigative and prosecutional capacity i support the inclusion of section 163 in the bill finally section 164 requires the secretary of state to report to congress within 90 days on the status of a comprehensive information sharing system on drug arrests of foreign nationals this system is intended to ensure that foreign drug traffickers are denied visas to enter the united states the system was required to be set up under the foreign relations authorizations act for fiscal years 1986 and 1987 i supported the original establishment of this system and concur in the foreign affairs committees determination to require a full accounting from the executive branch as to the implementation of this system in closing i must take this opportunity to express my deep concern for a problem that is not being addressed by this legislation i am shamefully aware of the discriminatory hiring practices at the department of state the agency for international development and the unitedstates information agency despite the fact that in 1980 congress enacted legislation requiring the foreign service agencies to aggressively seek an increase in the numbers of blacks hispanics asianamericans and women hired in these agencies there has been an appalling decline in minority representation in our principal foreign affairs agencies while i will support this legislation because of my commitment to eradicating the international drug problem i must admit that i am not completely supportive of the measure i am dismayed by the committees lack of action on this particular issue and demand that immediate congressional attention be given to securing enforcement of the foreign service act of 1980"], [0.49199795722961426,

become a national problem of crisis proportions during the last 25 years there has been a significant increase in drug abuse in the united states during this same time congress has responded with increased levels of spending to help combat the drug problem spending has risen from 82 million in 1969 to approximately 3 9 billion and 3 5 billion in 1987 and 1988 respectively i want to commend congressman ciharlie ranoe chairman of the select committee on narcotics abuse and control for his valuable and outspoken leadership in our war on drugs and in the formulation of this legislation today i also commend the different house committees of jurisdiction and their members for their hard work in putting together this legislation we can all be proud of the measure being considered here today it represents a strong step forward in our war on drugs and a renewed commitment to eliminate drugs from our streets and classrooms i am particularly proud of their provisions designed to reduce drug abuse among our young people and to make more readily available drug treatment facilities to all those in need in my district in the south bronx the incidence of youth participation in drug use and trafficking is alarming i therefore support the provisions in this bill that attempt to prevent drug abuse among our young people and attempt to reach out to members of youth gangs and juvenile delinquents to bring them into a more productive and meaningful life after world war ii there was a sharp increase in the use of heroin in our inner cities and more recently there has been an alarming increase in the use of cocaine and cocaine derivatives such as crack and rock in new york city alone there are an estimated 250 000 to 300 000 heroin addicts deaths due to cocaine abuse in the city have risen from 7 in 1983 to 92 in 1984 196 in 1985 and 287 in 1986 deaths due to aids among iv drug users has risen from 88 in 1983 to 293 in 1984 488 in 1985 and 1 000 in 1986 dug arrests in new york city are equally telling rising from 60 000 in 1985 and 69 500 in 1986 to over 80 000 in 1987 equally alarming is the fact that the increased use of drugs and especially the use of crack has involved population groups previously not associated with the problem this of course includes the tragic use of drugs and involvement in drug running by schoolage youth and adolescents today the problem has reached such crisis proportions that it comes as no surprise when we hear of youngsters in grammer school involved in drugs or when we hear of youth gang violence and law enforcement fatalities this simply cannot be allowed to continue we must make the full commitment necessary to eliminate drugs from our society the federal strategy in the war against drugs is multifaceted it includes initiatives to reduce the supply of drugs through drug and narcotics regulations and international control of drug production and trafficking it also includes initiatives to reduce the demand for drugs through education prevention treatment and rehab programs as well as programs funding research into drug dependency treatment and prevention the first major drug initiative the antidrug abuse act of 1986 increased spending by 1 7 billion for fiscal year 1987 this included new authorizations for state and local law enforcement and federal drug enforcement activities it also authorized new international narcotics control and drug interdiction activities as well as domestic drug abuse education treatment and research programs today and tomorrow congress will consider an omnibus drug bill which authorizes a total of 6 1 billion for new and existing programs this figure represents a 2 1 billion increase over amounts presently provided in fiscal year 1989 appropriation measures this new bill provides much needed funding for antidrug abuse education treatment and prevention programs it authorizes 30 million for drug abuse prevention targeting youth gangs and 15 million targeting runaway and homeless youth the legislation also authorizes 15 million for a national youth sports program and 10 million for drug abuse education in wic programs the drug bill will also provide funding for increased law enforcement and drug interdiction activities it authorizes 2 5 billion for a variety of enforcement and correctional programs in the department of justice and provides 346 million to the coast guard and 1 2 billion to the customs service for interdiction efforts it is essential that we do all that we can to stop the flow of drugs into our country and to address the problems associated with drug abuse and narcotics trafficking as chairman of the subcommittee on international finance trade and monetary policy i have carved out a role for the eximbank to make loans to democratic governments to reduce the production of drugs within their borders and the shipment of drugs into this country i also recommended the inclusion of a discretionary grant program for the

gentleman for yielding time and i rise in strong support of the civil rights restoration act it has been 4 years since the supreme court ruled in grove city college versus bell that federal antidiscrimination laws apply only narrowly to particular federally supported programs and not to recipient institutions as a whole while the grove city case specifically applied to title ix of the education amendments of 1972 the ruling has been interpreted to include section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 the age discrimination act of 1975 and title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 as the result women minorities the disabled and the elderly have been denied the protection which congress specifically intended them to receive clearly the court misinterpreted the intent of congress and we have been working ever since to clarify the coverage of those laws in june 1984 the house voted overwhelmingly in favor of legislation overturning the grove city decision unfortunately the reagan administration launched a fullscale attack against the bill and it was never brought up in the senate the real turning point occurred in 1985 when the unitedstates catholic conference issued a memo suggesting that the new proposal could force catholic teaching hospitals receiving federa assistance to perform abortions since then the civil rights restoration act has been tangled up as so many bills have been in the last few years over the abortion question when the senate considered the restoration act last month antiabortion senators were prepared to defeat the bill if restrictive language was not included and when the bill was finally adopted by that body that victory was tempered by the approved abortion language the danforth amendment specifies that institutions receiving federal aid are not required to provide or pay for abortions this language effectively supersedes existing regulations dating from 1972 that require educational institutions receiving federal aid to treat pregnancy childbirth and termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability where leave health services or insurance are concerned i am very disappointed that this congress in its effort to clarify and extend antidiscrimination laws must allow restricted access to legally protected medical care in permitting hospitals receiving federal funds to deny provision of abortion services the congress is actually sanctioning other form of discrimination this is a very regretful act but one it seems that is unavoidable at this time while i feel very strongly that a womans right to abortion includes the pilot of access to abortion services it is imperative that passage of the civil rights restoration act not be delayed any longer in these last few years during which congress has been divided over the scope of coverage under the law the rights of women minorities and disabled and elderly americans have been put on hold in the grove city case the supreme court unanimously held that financial aid dollars reaching a college through its students constituted federal financial assistance to the school the scope of duty not to discriminate however was defined narrowly by the court the court determined that student financial aid money only reached the schools financial aid office therefore only that office had to comply with federal antidiscrimination law as the result hundreds of discrimination cases have been dropped because the offending office or activity was deemed not in direct receipt of federal funds tho office for civil rights in the department of education one of the primary agencies responsible for enforcement of these basic civil rights laws has closed title ix title vi section 504 and age discrimination cases of lack of jurisdiction in all the office of civil rights has closed or scaled back the investigation of 674 sex discrimination cases since the grove city ruling court mandated desegregation efforts have also come to a halt the subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations which i chair recently held hearings on illegal racial discrimination at a number of southern universities and colleges as a result of that investigation the government operations committee issued a report entitled failure and fraud in civil rights enforcement by the department of education the committee concluded that 10 southern and border states are in violation of title vi of the civil rights act because they have not completely eliminated the remnants of previously illegal systems of higher education that separated students by race unfortunately under grove city the victims of racial discrimination have little form of redress late last year a title vi discrimination suit brought by the justice department against the university of alabama was blocked by a federal court of appeals which applied grove city versus bell to it as the result of this and similar rulings the effort to desegregate our nationss schools which began in 1954 has come to a screeching halt enforcement efforts have also been gutted at other federal agencies the office of civil rights at the department of health and human services and the department of housing and urban developments office for fair housing and equal opportunity report that they too have severely cut liack investigation of compliants by returning for four financial assistance civil rights statutes to their pregrove city status the congress will be renewing its commitment to fairness and equality at the same time we will be making certain that the next administration does not have an excuse to ignore its responsibility to enforce vital antidiscrimination laws i was very pleased that with the exception of the danforth amendment all of the weakening amendments proposed in the senate were defeated by large margins i am hopeful that the house will follow with passage of an equally strong bill and that it will be received favorably by the president at this time i would like to address specifically an amendment added by the senate regarding coverage of individuals with contagious diseases and infections under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 it is important to note that this amendment was added to clarifyand not modifythe current section 504 requirements applicable to such individuals the need for a clarification arises from a misplaced response by some employers to the recent supreme court decision in school board of nassau county versus arline although often misunderstood the supreme courts recent decision interpreting and applying section 504 does not require that entities covered under the section take unwarranted risks in hiring and retaining individuals with contagious diseases who pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others or who cannot perform the essential functions of a job the supreme court made that point very clearly in the arline decision see school board of nassau county v arline 107 s ct 1123 n 16 1987 a person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectiou3 disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk nevertheless some employers have reacted to the supreme court decision by expressing the unfounded concern that they could be required to hire or retain an individual who has a contagious disease or infection and for whom no reasonable accommodation could eliminate the significant risk of such an individual transmitting the disease to others in response the senate amendment clearly sets forth the basic standardof section 504 that effectively precludes imposing such a requirement on employers the language of the amendment is purposely patterned after a similar amendment adopted by congress in 1978 at that time many employers had similar unjustified concerns that they could be forced to hire or retain individuals who were alcohol or drug users and who could not perform the essential functions of a job or who posed a threat to others the 1978 amendment provided that the term handicapped individual did not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in question or whose employment by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others during the legislativ debate on the 1978 amendment many m mbers of congress pointed out that the therwise qualified standard of section 504 slready ensured that no such requirement could be placed on employers nevertheless congress enacted the amendment to reassure employers regarding the existing section 504 protections thereby avoiding a categorical exclusion of alcohol and drug users from the protections of the statute the senate amendment included in the civil rights restortation act which is patterned after the 1978 amendment thus specifies that for purposes of sections 503 and 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 as such sections relate to employment the term individual with handicaps does not include an individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who by reason of such disease or infection would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or who by reason of the currently contagious disease or infection is unable to perform the duties of the job the basic manner in which individuals with contagious diseases and infections can present a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace is if there is a significant risk that the individual could transmit the contagious disease or infection to other individuals in such circumstances the individual is not otherwise qualified to remain in that particular position the supreme court in arline explicitly recognized this necessary limitation in the protections of section 504 the senate amendment places that standard in statutory languagethereby hopefully allaying any misplaced concerns on the part of employers it is important to note the aspects that this amendment does not change first the amendment does nothing to change the requirements in the regulations and caselaw regarding providing reasonable accommodations for persons with contagious diseases or infections thus if a reasonable accommodation would eliminate the existence of a direct threat or an individuals inability to perform the essential duties of a job the individual is qualified to remain in his or her position second the twostep process of section 504 should continue to apply in cases involving individuals with contagious diseases and infections that is a court must first determine whether a plaintiff is protected under the statute under the traditional threepart definition of individual with handicaps under the statute the court mi st then determine whether the individual is otherwise qualified to hold the particular position at issue in the case before it in his dissent in the arline case justice rehnquist stated that congress should have stated explicitly that individuals with contagious diseases were intended to be covered under section 504 congress has done so now with this amendment stating clearly that individuals with contagious diseases or infections are protected under the statute as long as they meet the otherwise qualified standard this clarity is particularly important with regard to infections because individuals who are suffering from a contagious infectionsuch as carriers of the aids virus or carriers of the hepatitis b viruscan also be discriminated against on the basis of their infection and are also individuals with handicaps under the statute see e g local 1812 american federation of govomment employees v unitedstates department of state 662 f supp 50 d d c 1987 hivinfection ray v school district of desoto county 666 f supp 1524 m d fla 1987 hivinfection new york state association for retarded children v carey 612 f 2d 644 ca2 1979 hepatitis b carrier as the senate amendment now restates in statutory terms such individuals are also not otherwise qualified if without reasonable accommodation they would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others or could not perform the essential functions of a job because of the importance of these protections public health leaders have called for vigorous enforcement of section 504 with regard to cases involving aids and infection with the aids virus the national academy of sciences in its authoritative report confronting aids specifically pointed out the importance of section 504 as a means to fight medically unjustified discrimination the committee believes that discrimina tlion against persons who have aids or who are infected by hiv is not justified and it encourages and supports laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and housing as formal expressions of public policy the committee also supports a federal policy to include aids as a handicapping condition under the federal law prohibiting improper discrimination against the handicapped the congress noted in 1978 with regard to alcohol and drug users that the addition of an amendment was unnecessary in light of current law nevertheless rather than exclude categorically a group of individuals we added a provision to reassure employers regarding the requirements that currently existed in law to protect public health and safety that same purpose motivates the inclusion of this amendment i support the civil rights restoration act with this amendment because it continues to maintain the proper balance that currently exists between protecting the public health and private rights i urge adoption of the bill march 0 1988 tl1573 h 574 co"], [0.49213075637817383, 0.5078692436218262, 1, "i join my distinguished

her discrimination complaint unless the computer software used in the computers purchased with federal funds was also purchased with federal aid the grove city ruling is gutting executive branch enforcement of these laws pending litigation is also being frustrated by the absurdities of the courts analysis for example on october 6 of last year the fifth circuit court of appeals cited grove city in dismissing the justice departments race discrimination suit against the state of alabamas higher education system this complaint which alleges racial discrimination in every aspect of the university systememployment resources allocated to white and black schools etc has been winding its way through the federal administrative process for many years private parties who had intervened in the case were also blocked in their effort to obtain relief this bill applies to all pending cases it is of great concern that it has taken this long to pass this legislation i wish that no cases had been lost because of this delay of the 21 hearings were conducted by the judiciary and education and labor committees in joint hearings conducted in washington dc and across the country s 557 is a product of these committees labors this legislation must be passed preliminary findings by civil rights investigators of the committee on education and labor show that the department of educations office of civil rights has closed 70 percent of its higher education cases because of the supreme courts ruling the senate report accompanying s 557 finds ocr has closed or narrowed at least 674 of the civil rights complaints it had on file in addition 156 departmentinitiated civil rights compliance reviews have been dropped or narrowed following the grove city decision in the wake of grove city federal civil rights specialists now spend their time tracing the flow of federal dollars rather than investigating and remedying civil rights complaints as the senate report notes federal officials have encountered serious difficulty complying with the grove city decision not only does the governments available data system prevent it from tracing federal fundsso that the government must rely on the alleged discriminating institutions representations as to where the funds were spentthe results of this audit approach when tried is often absurd for example it was reported to education and labor committee investigators this year that in a complaint involving university housing and student services ocr had to determine if the universitys committee on appeals of residences the bill before us is a simple restoration bill the distinguished chairman of the judiciary and education and labor committees have carefully explained the scope of coverage of these four laws set forth in s 557 let me stress that the provisions in s 557 do not become operative unless there is a recipient of federal financial assistance these are terms of art defined in existing federal regulations the civil rights restoration bill does not change the meaning of those terms of art it broadly defines the scope of coverage of title vi of the 1964 civil rights act title ix of the 1972 education amendments section 504 of the 1973 rehabilitation act and the 1975 age discrimination act by defining the terms program and program or activity wherever they appear in each of the four laws during senate debate on s 557 two amendments were adopted on the floor the harkinhumphrey amend ment is a clarifying amendment with respect to employment under the 1973 rehabilitation act the danforth amendment is in a substantive change regarding insurance coverage for abortions the senate amendment concerns coverage of individuals with contagious diseases and infections under section 504 of the rehabilitation act insofar as that law covers employment this amendment clarifies that congress intends the rehabilitation act to apply to persons with that kind of handicap unless they pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others or are unable to perform the essential duties of the job this amendment essentially places into the statute the standard and approach of the recent supreme court decision in school board of nassau county versus arline the colloquy in the senate between the two cosponsors of the amendment clarifies that it is the intent of congress that the amendment result in no change in the substantive law with regard to assessing whether persons with this kind of handicapping condition are otherwise qualified for the job in question or whether employers must provide reasonable accommodations for such individuals this amendment is riecessary solely to allay the fears of some employers who have misinterpreted the arline decision as requiring them to take unwarranted risks in hiring individuals with contagious diseases or infections this amendment therefore places the requirements of current law into statute it does so by codifying the otherwise qualified framework for courts to utilize in these cases this is identical to what was done in 1978 when employers has similar unjustifiable concerns regarding employment of drug and alcohol users who were not qualified for employment positions the framework to be used was explained by the supreme court in school board of nassua county versus arline it requires a medical assessment of whether exclusion is necessitated by the degree of risk involved in the particular situation a courts determination of whether a risk of transmissibility is significant and thus poses a dirct threat to the health or safety of others will be highly factspecific so too will be the determination of whether a reasonable accommodation by the employer can eliminate the risk the outcome of each case will depend on the medical facts concerning the particular infectious condition how that infection is transmitted and the nature of the job in question if a court were to find based on medical evidence that the employment of an individual with a contagious disease or infection did present a significant risk of transmitting that condition to others and no reasonable accommc lation could eliminate that risk it would be proper to deny that individual relief under section 504 as i noted this amendment is designed to place this framework into the statute thus this amendment affirmswithout modifying or changingthe current substantive protections for people with contagious diseases or infections i commend the members of the senate for fashonioning this amendment in such a way that the courts will continue to adjudicate cases involving aids hiv infection and other communicable conditions on a case by case basis i also wish to point out that the law under section 504 has long had to deal with situations other than contagious diseases or infections in which claims were made that the employment of a person with a handicap create a risk of harm to others in the workplace such cases have included for example school bus drivers with hearing impairments strathie v department of transportation 716 f 2d 227 3d cir 1983 and machine operators with epilepsy montolete v bolger 767 f 2d 1416 19 cir 1985 in these and other cases the courts have adopted a standard requiring that defendants show a significant or substantial risk of harm in order to prove that the plaintiffs were not otherwise qualified under section 504 for the job in question these cases demonstrate that determining risk of harm in these situations is well within the capacity of the courts the amendment which we are enacting today concerning contagious diseases or infections thus logically and appropriately parallels current law governing the risk of harm from employing individuals with other kinds of handicaps i am pleased that our desire to prohibit discriminatory employment policies which are medically unjustified is being preserve in such a way that the nature of the handicap does not lead to a greater leeway for discrimination although as i have noted this amendment is essentially unnecessary because it restates current law i believe it can serve a useful clarifying function it is unfortunate in my view that the senate failed to adopt an abortionfree bill house sponsors of this legislation could have reported a bill with such an amendment in the 98th congress however we knew that abortion was wrongly tied to this legislation and therefore we urged senate sponsors to present us with a clean billsomething they were unable to do i do not believe that the danforth amendment belongs on this bill but i will support the bill including the amendment because of the critically important statements made by senator danforth in describing its purpose and effect he said and i quote the amendment says that 0 a college is prohibited from discriminating against people who have had abortions or who are seeking abortions 135 cong rec s 163 jan 27 1988 senator wilson who had a role in drafting the amendment said that it was drafted to ensure that there could not be discrimination against women who either are seeking or have received abortionrelated services 135 cong rec s 227 jan 28 1988 such assurance that the danforth amendment clearly prohibits any covered institution from discriminating against a woman who is seeking or has had an abortion is critical to my support of this provision whether it be scholarships promotions extracurricular activities student employment or any other benefits offered to students or employees under title ix benefits cannot be withheld from a student or employee because she received or is seeking an abortion finally it is important to keep in mind not only what the danforth amendment does but what it does not do under its provisions a covered institution does not have to include the costs of an abortion procedure in insurance for its students or employees but does not mean that it can exclude for example medical complications related to an abortion under the danforth amendment title ix still requires those complications to be covered i do not take the loss of health insurance to cover the costs of an abortion procedure lightly nor do i approve of the danforth amendments exclusion of the performance or use of facilities for performance of an abortion but at least we in the house have the assurance that is the limit to the damage that danforth does and it is only because of this assurance that i am supporting the bill"], [0.4922223687171936, 0.5077776312828064, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume we now turn to section 224 of the bill this language was put in the bill by a vote of the committee and it was also reinserted in the bill in the socalled aspin amendment i would like to explain briefly to the house basically what the conunittee has done in adopting this language as it applies to the abm treaty i support the committees language and would like to explain to the house basically and briefly what the committee has done essentially what the committee has done is to require the president to follow the interpretation of the abm treaty that every president has followed since president nixon signed it in 1972 by putting these provisions in the bill we are not putting new restrictions on the president the abm treaty having been ratified by the senate is the law of the land and the president is bound to uphold it by his oath of office the abm treaty was signed on may 26 1972 and ratified on august 3 1972 by a vote of 88 to 2 until october 6 1985 both the united states and the soviet union understood the treaty to have a settled meaning since that meaning was commonly accepted for over 13 years it is called understandably the traditional interpretation what is the traditional interpretation quite simply the traditional interpretation permits research and some development of abm or strategic defense systems but it prohibits field testing and engineering development of all but fixed landbased systemsunless of course there is an amendment to the treaty in other words the abm treaty is read to mean that neither party will develop test or deploy abm systems or components which are seabased airbased spacebased or mobile landbased dr john s foster who was director of the research development testing and engineering department in the department of defense at the time the treaty was negotiated and ratified and who was our chief scientist in the department of defense and the thirdranking official in the department of defense intimately familiar with the abm treaty and familiar with the oversight and development of our own safeguard system and in touch with the treaty negotiations provided this explanation of the treaty when it was being ratifiedand i quote dr fosters own statement article v prohibits the development and testing of abm systems or components that are seabased air based or mobile landbased constraints imposed by the phrase development and testing would be applicable only to that portion of the advanced development stage following laboratory testing i e that stage which is verifiable by national means therefore a prohibition on developmentthe russian word is creation would begin only at the stage where laboratory testing ended on a3m components on either a prototype or breadboard model this was the meaning given to the abm treaty by dr john s foster and it is the meaning virtually all of our principal negotiators give to the treaty gerard smith the chief negotiator lt gen royal allison the senior military adviser john rhinelander the legal adviser and harold brown who was also one of the delegates and a member of the negotiating team it is also the meaning we ask the executive branch to follow by the provisions of this bill until october 1985 everyone agreed that this was the meaning of the a3m treaty even this administration in its annual impact statements on arms control interpreted the treaty in this manner for example prior to october of 1985 the sdio the strategic defense office issued a report in which it indicated that it was bound by these restrictions in the abm treaty and judge sofir who has subsequently developed a broader interpretation or a different interpretation of the treaty admits that the sdio the sdi office itself and i quote from him expressly embraced the restrictive interpretation of the treaty in october 1985 the administration announced that it had found another meaning in the treaty under its reinterpretation the treaty does not ban development and testing of mobile space abm systems if they are based on physical principles other than those incorporated in the abm systems current in 1972 when the treaty was made gerard smith our chief negotiator has said that interpreting the abm treaty in this new manner to allow development of abm systems based on new physical principles is like interpreting the volstead act to allow the sale of liquor general allison the senior military advisor to the abm negotiators has said nowhere did i understand that we retained the right to development and fullscale testing of new systems what the armed services committee is saying in this bill is simple and fundamental we are saying mr president this is a treaty we are construing it is not an installment sales contract or the trust indenture to a subordinated debenture this is not the occasion for a lawyers contrived or clever interpretation this is a treaty made by the united states and treaties solemnly made ought to be solemnly kept what the armed services committee is saying is as simple and fundamental as that if the president believes that we should alter or abandon the abm treaty the language of our bill does not foreclose that course of action it simply says that the president should use the way out provided by article xv of the treaty these provisions are as simple and fundamental as saying that the president should uphold this treaty the law of our land in accordance with the meaning given to it by our delegates when it was negotiated by our officials when it was ratified and by the conduct and statements of both parties for the past 13 years i urge the members to vote against the motion to strike and for these fundamental principles as contained in the bill"], [0.49231475591659546, 0.5076852440834045, 1, "i rise in strong support of h r 2782 which authorizes fiscal year 1988 funding for the national aeronautics and space administration this bill represents the culmination of many many monthsof study analysis and debate by members of the science space and technology committee special recognition should be given to mr nelson of florida chairman of the space science and applications subcommittee mr mccurdy chairman of the transportation aviation and materials subcommittee mr lujan ranking republican member of the committee and the respective subcommittee ranking republicans mr walker and mr lzwis of florida for their dedicated efforts to bring a balanced bill to the floor americas space program is at a critical crossroads and most assuredly this is no ordinary authorization bill because the decisions we make here today will determine the future of our space program the tragic challenger accident 18 months ago with the loss of seven heroic astronauts shook the very foundation of our space program out of that turmoil the investigations that followed and the coldeyed reassessment of our nations space initiative we are now prepared to apply the painful lessons learned from the challenger loss i believe that h r 2782 sets americas space program on a stable and advancing track once again i urge my colleagues to give it critical consideration the committee firmly believes that the 9 522 000 000 authorization figure represents the absolute minimum level necessary to carry out nasas space and aeronautics programs in fiscal year 1988 this amount slightly exceeds the administration request of 9 487 000 000 with the increases primarily in aeronautics initiatives i would point out that the administrations proposal provided for a budget increase of 6 percent real growth in the midst of a budgetcutting environment to achieve deficit reduction this is a clear message about the criticality assigned to americas continuing leadership in space as an authorizing committee we are acutely aware of our responsibility for establishing priorities that serve as guidelines for annual as well as longterm budget decisions three areas in h r 2782 represent priorities that the committee believes were inadequately addressed in the administrations request the first concerns the pragmatism of our space transportation policy in the areas of space transportation the recovery and return to flight status for the space shuttle continues to dominate nasas activities by far the largest portion of the nasa budget about 42 percent is allocated for the space shuttle program and the recovery from the accident of january 28 of last year our priority surely is to get the shuttle flying again but the shuttle alone cannot provide a balanced space transportation program the challenger accident taught us never again to put all our eggs in one basket or in one launch vehicle the price of that vulnerability echoes daily through a growing backlog of satellite payloads and a grounded space science program that reality grows bleaker as we observe the soviet union europe and japan aggressively advancing both space science programs and commercial space ventures present and future space transportation policy must not mean just shuttle policy but a mixed fleet policy in light of this h r 2782 provides support not only for continued redesign and testing of the shuttles solid rocket motors but also support for nasa to either buy or buy the service of unmanned expendable launch vehicles for the shortterm elvs will provide the means to begin decreasing the costly backlog of flight payloads that has been building since the challenger crash for the long term elvs will provide the balance and flexibility that have been missing in our space transportation program the committees second priority was funding for the advanced communications technology satellite program we have provided funding for the advanced communications technology satellite program we are well past the midpoint in this program and the committee believes it is vital to follow through on this congressional initiative the area of communications research has been one of our most valuable investments and it is essential that we maintain our world leadership position through this program america is being challenged successfully in many areas by other industrial nations the issue of unitedstates competitiveness is central to almost every subject on our national agenda today and the field of advanced communications technologies is at the cuttingedge at global competition this very day we are in a race with the japanese and europeans for supremacy in the next generation of communications satellites the acts program is the next major step for the advancement of our communications technologies the simple reality is that continued funding foi acts may well determine whether we will be the winners or losers of that race a third committee priority was to help ensure the viability of our planetary exploration program which has already experienced severe delays and was particularly hard hit by the challenger accident the backbone of planetary exploration and space science is a dynamic and dedicated community of space scientists the science mission delays and payload groundings pose a serious threat to our ability to retain this vital technical corps given the discouraging prospect for launches the committe has very reluctantly accepted the 2year delay in the launch date of the mars observer however we have provided funds to buy spare parts in order to guarantee that the spacecraft will be in complete readiness for its 1992 launch the spares will also allow us to begin work on the second observer mission the lunar polar orbiter both observer initiatives constitute advanced units for data collection and information gathering that will be the basis for a future unitedstates mars mission and americas return to the moon the explorer program has also been augmented by 10 million to expand flight opportunities for university space science projects we are committed to this special emphasis and funding for space science programs in the fiscal year 1988 budget because we believe these programs represent the advanced guard for americas space development work funding at the administration request level has been maintained for the space station in h r 2782 we must understand the station as much more than a masterful engineering feat or new showpiece technology it will be a place for man to conduct routine scientific and commercial operations for decades to come it will be the major mechanism for reaching our goal to establish man as a builder and permanent worker in space the united states has hesitated and delayed its space station planning meanwhile the russians have continued to expand their already functioning station and accrue vital experience in its operations if we dont move ahead with stable funding and steady progress were never going to realize the operation of this facility the raw truth is that the russians are out there now and were talking about a target date of 6 years from now the history books will someday report that the soviets had a permanent place in space almost a decade before the americans we cant change that fact lets make sure we dont make it worse the bill also contains request level funding for nasas new start in global geospace sciences which will explore the effect of the sun on the earths climate this is an international program that we have agreed to do jointly with the europeans and the japanese it represents 1 of 6 areas of expanded agreement for joint projects we reached recently with visiting japanese diet members that in itself is important but of equal importance is the fact that this program is a new start there is special value in these new efforts because they keep us pushing the frontiers further and further they pump new blood and new boldness into our searches we have funded at the request level another new startthe civil space technology initiative this program is a direct outgrowth of the foresight and wisdom contained in the recommendations from the presidents national commission on space the commission warned that we were neglecting our base technologies research these are the core research efforts that provide the informational and technological base from which our future space potential will grow i mentioned earlier that this bill exceeds only slightly the administration proposal for nasa fiscal year 1988 and that this was primarily in the aeronautics area there was a time when the products of americas aircraft industry were the unquestioned choice of almost every nation in the world that is no longer the case our preeminence has eroded our european competitors have gained important inroads into global markets that bought exclusively american last year for example airbus a european aircraft manufacturing consortium captured 42 percent of all sales in the united statesa market which had been the almost exclusive property of american companies the increases for aeronautics research and technology development are designed to capture the future for unitedstates aviation with this in mind and because new technology is such a strong force in aircraft sales the committee is recommending increased attention to research on innovative aeronautical concepts because history has shown repeatedly that this is where aviation breakthroughs have originated there is also strong support to rehabilitate old research facilities these facilities mostly wind tunnels represent a multibilliondollar investment that the country has relied on to maintain preeminence in aviation unfortunately many are oldsome over 50 yearsand have not been maintained properly in order to restore them to productive use and safe condition the committee is recommending a downpayment on this task in fiscal year 1988 these will be dollars well spent to regain american excellence in aviation the house has before it in h r 2782 both a balanced and a bold program to build an american space future worthy of its past achievements but here in 1987 we are at a critical crossroads in our countrys space program july 9 1987 co nasa and the nation have a formidable agenda to resolve our decisions can build weakness or they can build strength they can be based on courage or on retreat they can regain our world leadership or drag us limping behind our competitors and partners much of what happens tomorrow will be decided here today i urge you to vote for h r 2782 it will be a vote for courage and or strength america has taken the world to the moon we created a new and dramatic vision forman beyofnd this planet we will do it again"], [0.49232786893844604, 0.507672131061554, 1, "i rise in strong support of h r 1158 the fair housing amendments act of 1988 as passed by the other body on august 2 1988 this bill is basically a refinement of the bill the house passed on june 29 1988 it makes minor changes with the bill most of them technical and all of the major provisions remain of the bill we passed the fair housing act title viii of the civil rights act of 1968 was the final chapter in the great series of civil rights laws enacted in the 1960s the fair housing act states categorically that it is the policy of the united states to provide for fair housing throughout the country but despite this proclamation fair housing remained just a dream for too many ameritns because the law lacked an effective enforcement mechanism today 20 years later the fair housing amendments act marks a turning point in our nations commitment to eradicating discrimination in housing it is the most important civil rights advancement since the mid1960s h r 1158 marks a historic change in three important areas it goes beyond the mere statement of principles on fair housing and creates an effective and meaningful enforcement system it also extends protections to individuals with handicaps and families with children the senatepassed bill differs only slightly from the housepassed bill all of the changes are outlined below the provisi3 regarding restoring modifications to rental property made by handicapped persons is clarified language is added to the section on adaptability and accessibility requirements for covered new multifamily dwellings to encourage state and local governments to review for compliance with these requirements when they review and approve building plans and construction a technical amendment is made to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies to make it clear that agencies given interim certifications of hud are covered by the provision the authority to litigate fair housing cases is consolidated in the justice department while it is made clear that the department is required to bring cases authorized by the secretary under the bills provisions regarding prompt judicial action and regarding federal court enforcement of cases in which a party to an administrative proceeding elects to have the charge heard in federal court technical amendments are made to the bills provisions giving parties to administrative proceedings the right to have charges arising out of those proceedings heard in federal court the exemption for housing for older persons from the bills provisions banning discrimination on the basis of familial status are modified a provision is added to the housing for older persons exemption to make it clear that occupants of housing that currently excludes children will not be taken into account in applying the requirements for the exemptions so long as futare occupants meet the requirements the bills provision regarding familial status is clarified to confirm that pregnant women and per ms adopting minor children are covere by the provision the provision not prohibiting conduct against a person convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance is changed the bill clarifies that the handicap provisions shall not apply to an individual solely because that individual is a transvestite these changes made by the senate do not significantly alter the house passed bill the important improvements to the enforcement system remainadministrative enforcement with a right to a trail by jury protections for individuals with handicaps and families with children continue to be included i would however like to address two of the most notable differences litigation authority and families with children the senate passed version of h r 1158 moves litigation authority from the department of housing and urban development to the department of justice a similar amendment was offered but not adopted during house consideration of the bill by my friend from pennsylvala mr gekas in the house bill the amendment offered by mr fish and adopted 4010 restructured the enforcement provisions to provide both an administrative process or access to a federal jury trail for any party to a housing discrimination complaint in either instance the case would be brought and maintained by hud attorneys the fish amendment reflected month of negotiation and compromise the fis package put litigation authority in hud transferring litigation authority to the justice department may create distinctions in federal agency responsibilities between hud and the justice department in fair housing cases the senate bill transfers litigation authority to the justice department in cases where an election is made to go to federal court this divides the responsibility for handling these often routine cases between the two departments depending on wich type of formal adjudication the parties elected the substantive law discovery and evidentiary standards will be the same in either forum transferring the authority to litigate the housing discrimination cases in midstream may defeat consistency and hamper the development of an effective body of expertise within hud instead of having hud bring the case from start to finish investigating the complaint drafting the discrimination charge and litigating the case the justice department now a ugutst 8 1988 64197 picks up the case if an election for judicial enforcement is made i trust that the department of justice will develop sufficient emphasis in litigation of fair housing cases to be effective in handling individual claims of discrimination the civil rights division of the justice department has a broad mandate to address problems of discrimination in many different contexts because fair housing cases will constitute only a fraction of the discrimination cases handled by the justice department the possibility exists that individual cases of housing discrimination may not receive the focus needed to address the national problem of housing discrimination i expect the justice department to vigorously pursue these cases the other change made is to the families with children provision and the exemption for housing for older persons from the time we introduced the bill we recognized the special needs of senior citizens and exempted certain senior citizen communities from the families with children requirement during the life of this bill this exemption has undergone refinements we went from exempting bona fide retirement communities to creating a detailed exemption of either where all the residents of the community are 62 or older or where at least 90 percent of the units have at least one person 55 or older and the community provides significant facilities and services to meet their physical or social needs the senate passed bill further refines and clarifies the second part of this standard by requiring at least one person 55 or older per unit in determining whether a community qualifies for this exemption the secretary of hud is required to develop regulations including at least the following factors first that at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by persons 55 or older second the publication of and adherence to policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent to provide housing for persons 55 or older and third the existence of sig nificant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons if the provision of facilities and services is not practicable then the community must provide important housing opportunities for older persons development of regulations by the secretary of hud will be an important step in implementing this exemption this section is not intended to provide a broad exemption for the provision of facilities and services in order to show that the provision of significant facilities and services is not practicable owners managers and developers of housing for older persons have a heavy burden to satisfy in order to meet the showing of impracticability a demonstration must be made that providing significant facilities and services would result in depriving low and moderate income older persons of needed and desired housing the fact that the facilities and service are expensive to provide is not alone sufficient to meet the standard of impracticability this standard cannot be satisfied only by estimates of increased costs business inefficiency or loss of profit independent and objective evidence must be provided to establish impracticability mere opinion that the provision of such facilities and services is impracticable is not sufficient in addition the housing must be shown to provide important housing opportunities for older persons affordable housing for older persons of low or moderate incomes must not be otherwise available in the community hud should use its expertise in dealing with affordable housing to develop standards to carry out the intent of this section the senate bill also adds a transition provision for existing residents of communities providing housing for older persons thus no person currently living in such a community will be forced to move out of their homes and the exemption for the community will not be jeopardized air speaker i support both of these additional modifications to the housing for older persons exemption the senate bills refinements of the exemption are constructive additions to the bill the 80 percent requirement provides flexibility for communities to maintain its exempt status when qualified older residents leave a unit due to death or disability for example and persons living with the older person such as a spouse or companilon remain these persons will be able to continue to live in the unit i am pleased that following the house passage of this bill by an overwhelming vote of 378 to 23 the administration finally bowed to the inevitable and decided that it too hard should find a way to support the bill its been a long long trail for them beginning with the opposition of the justice department in 1981 and continuing until just after the house vote all during the judiciary committees consideration of this bill the justice department opposed the bill of fering no positive alternative of its own during house consideration of the bill negative signals were sent up to us via messages from the white house and very damaging amend ments were given to senior republicans placing the bill in peril until the very end however in the last few days compromises were made the changes that were subsequently negotiated in the senate do not do substantial harm to the bill and led to a 94 to 3 victory in the senate i am pleased that at the end of this long 10year battle we were able to gain the administrations support i want to thank the many players in the long campaign to make the fair housing amendments act a reality not surprisingly the many civil rights and fair housing organizations have worked diligently and in the trenches for over 10 years to get this bill enacted but just as notable has been the support of the housing and real estate industry these organizations realize that fair housing is good for america and their efforts showed that fair housing is not just rhetoric but good policy the national association of realtors in 1980 our opponents in 1988 became our allies their leadership both nationally and in the washington office should be saluted for their efforts to work out a fair and just solution to the issue of fair housing enforcement and the national association of horne builders provided unvaluable support and counsel especially related to the provisions regarding the handicapped i want to thank my committee colleagues for their strong and bipartisan support and want to salute two key members of the committee the support and vision of key sponsor and coauthor of the bill my good friend and colleague iiamilton fishi jr made enactment of h r 1158 a reality and the chairman of committee pmer w rodirio jr now in his last term in the congress who was here and led us through all the great civil rights struf gles in the congress always provided us with the support necessary to enact this bill we will miss his leadership in

for addressing the unfair trade practices of many of our trade competitors and authorizes funding for training and educational programs that will help our workers to be competitive and to adjust to the effects of increased foreign competition it is good legislation that will generally benefit american workers and businesses and strengthen the economy however there is one provision in this measure to which i must take strong exception that provision opens a large loophole in the law for the dutyfree import of ethanol shipped from the caribbean basin this loophole will undercut domestic ethanol production reduce the demand for americangrown corn and other ethanol feedstocks and undermine our efforts to encourage expansion of the domestic ethanol industry it was unwise to include this provision which will expand imports in legislation designed to encourage american exports it is iinfnrtunate that a provision which will allow clever investors to buy subsidized european wine alcohol and convert it into ethanol for sale in united states markets at subsidized prices was allowed to be included in a bill which is expressly designed to prevent subsidized goods from unfairly competing with unsubsidized american products this provision stands in opposition to the basic thrust of this legislation and it should not have been included in the conference report the ethanol provision in this bill allows a group of ethanol facilities in the caribbean basin to take advantage of the dutyfree status of countries covered by the caribbean basin initiative current law requires that ethanol imported from the caribbean must come primarily from caribbean feedstocks this requirement was put in place to ensure that caribbean ethanol production actually benefits the people of the caribbean the language in the conference report suspends the caribbean feedstock requirement it allows the caribbean facilities to buy cheap wine alcohol run it through inexpensive dehydration facilities that require little investment and create very few jobs and then import the processed ethanol into the united states in doing so they will receive dutyfree treatment that was intended only for substantial new investment and job creation in the caribbean basin even though this legislation has not yet been enacted caribbean companies are already preparing for the new opportunity that this bill offers them according to the march 28 edition of alcohol week a publication that closely follows the ethanol industry representatives of one of these caribbean companies met with officials of the european economic community recently to discuss the purchase of surplus european wine alcohol at low prices so that they can transship it through the caribbean to avoid united states tariffs upgrade it to fuelgrade ethanol there and sell it in the united states market the article goes on to say that in the past this company reportedly has been able to buy european wine alcohol for as little as 17 cents per gallon official italian government records show that 190proof italian ethanol was sold for export to the caribbean for an average price of 23 cents per gallon in 1987 while french ethanol was sold for just under 40 cents per gallon now the major difference between 190proof wine alcohol and 200proof fuelgrade ethanol is that fuel ethanol has had the remaining water removed from it but fuel ethanol coming to the united states from the caribbean has a value of closer to 80 cents per gallon if it is not subject to unitedstates tariffs and that is where the caribbean facilities enter the picture if they can process the 190proof wine alcohol into fuel ethanol in the caribbean they can avoid the tariff and compete in the unitedstates market at a substantial advantage that advantage produces large profits which is why caribbean companies worked so hard to obtain the provision in the conference report which allows them to avoid the feedstock lequiroments in current law and still receive dutyfree treatment for the ethanol they want to import into the united states this special treatment for ethanol imported from the caribbean basin is likely to displace sales of ethanol produced from domestic sources it will mean a loss of jobs in unitedstates ethanol facilities it will mean a loss of sales for unitedstates corn producers it will mean an increase in the unitedstates grain surplus and will likely lead to an increase in federal farm program costs but i tear that this ethanol loophole will have an even more chilling effect it will discourage the development of new ethanol capacity in the united states why should an american company expand its ethanol capacity or enter the ethanol business when the unitedstates congress is adopting legislation that will allow foreign producers to undercut unitedstates production why should an american business undertake the risks inherent in the production of a fuel such as ethanol when the federal government proposes to allow foreign ethanol into this country which can command an unfairly low price because it was produced from heavily subsidized surplus wine alcohol from other countries i fear that we will see a stagnant industry a few years from now and we will look back to this day as the day that the unitedstates congress cut off the future of this industry by favoring subsidized foreign production i must admit that my concerns about this provision are tempered by a small amount of hope i still have hope that this provision will not mean the end of the ethanol industrys impressive expansion over the past 10 years for two reasons first the conference report calls for studics by the international trade commission and the general accounting office to recommend appropriate feedstock requirements i believe that these studies will identify the iiaportance to the caribbean people as well as to the united states of strong but fair feedstock requirements the recommendtions of these agencies will hopefully point us in the right direction the second reason i have hope despite the unfortunate ethanol language in this conference report is that the caribbean basin initiative will be reconsidered in the next 2 years i and my colleagues in the alcohol fuel caucus have argued from the very beginning that that is the proper forum for considering the question of what is the appropriate feedstock requirement for caribbean ethanol that is permitted dutyfree treatment the current law reflects a compromise developed in 1986 to address this issue if opponents of the feedstock requirement believe it has not been set at an appropdate level they should raise that issue in hearings on the caribbean basin economic recovery act not in an omnibus trade bill such as this this conference report is good trade legislation but it is tarnished by the cbi ethanol language i regret that the two issues have been linked together and that several caribbean ethanol companies will be allowed to invade the unitedstates market and jeopardize this important industry"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5098035335540771, 0.5098035335540771, 0, "the united states has a special unique relationship with our northern

canada under the gatt it covers substantially all trade and is therefore acceptable under the provisions of article xxiv of the gatt the fta is already being viewed internationally as creating a positive climate for further gatt negotiations the pta legislation before this house reflects months of negotiations between representatives of tile executive branch members of congress and relevant committee staff under the fasttrack provisions 19 unitedstatesc 21912194 the congress has at the outside 90 legislative days within which to approve this language if approved by the house of representatives the united states senate and the canadian parliament the pta will take effect on or after january 1 1989 h r 5090 was referred to the committee on the judiciary principally because of the modifications of judicial review contained in the free trade agreement and because of certain constitutional questions raised in connection with the binational review panels established by the free trade agreement specifically under the free trade agreement administrative decisions in antidumping and countervailing duty cases are made subject to review by fiveperson panels consisting of individuals appointed by the two countries these binational panelsthat essentially replace judicial review in the court of international trade and any subsequent appellate reviewwill be implementing international law as reflected in the text of the agreement they will however be applying the laws of the country whose agency decision is being reviewed including the existing standard of judicial review in such cases there are also some immigration provisions of note contained in the free trade agreement chapter 15 of the pta and section 307 of h r 5090 provides for the temporary entry of business persons traders and investors professionals and intracompany transfers on a reciprocal basis while maintaining necessary provisions to ensure border security and protect domestic labor concerns most of chapter 15 is consistent with existing provisions of the immigration and nationality act however legislative action is needed to allow tie admission of treaty traders and investors as nonimmigrants since to date canada and the united states have never entered into a formal treaty trader relationship the agreement lists the specific occupations to be covered the united states and canada are to establish a procedure for the annual review of the implementation of these provisions by immigration officials of both countries the subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice of the judiciaxy committee held a hearing on april 21 of this year principally focusing on the binational review mechanism i am satisfied based upon the testimony from that hearing and from subsequent staff analyses that the constitutional questions raised by the creation of the binational panels have been satisfactorlly resolved first of all because of the broad power that congress has with respect to commerce and international trade an article iiijudcialforum is not required to resolve commercial disputes arising out of dumping and countervailing duty cases second the procedural due process rights of the interested persons are fully protected by the manner of appointment of the panels and the opportunity to fully participate in these proceedings third the department of justice raised concerns during the course of the negotiations as to whether or not the implementation of decisions by the binational panels might be inconsistent with the appointments clause of the constitution the language contained in h r 5090 reflects a compromise responding to those concerns the language contained in the implementing legislation provides for the direct implementation of the decisions of the panels by the international trade commission or the international trade administration however in the unlikely event that a constitutional challenge is successfully brought against this approach the president is authorized to accept panel decisions as a whole and to assure that the ruling will be implemented before closing i want to commend the

action to return four pivotal civil rights laws to their rightful status prior to two supreme court decisions which occurred on february 28 1984 these decisions were grove city college v bell secretary of education 104 s ct 1211 1984 and consolidated rail corporation v darrone 104 s ct 1248 1984 the civil rights restoration act is intended to reestablish the fundainental principle that when any part of an organizational entity receives federal financial assistance then all of the operations of that entity are subject to the antidiscrimination requirements contained in four civil rights statutes the four laws to which i refer are first title ix of the education amendments of 1972 second title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 third the rehabilitation act of 1973 and fourth the age discrimination act each of these laws prohibits discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance title ix prohibits discrimination based upon sex title vi prohibits discrimination based upon race color or national origin section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 prohibits discrimination based upon a persons disability the age discrimination act prohibits discrimination based upon an individuals age so if you choose to participate in federal programs and receive federal financial aid you must comply with the antidiscrimination requirements of all four of these laws this seems to me a patently logical and fundamentally fair result the federal government should not be in the business of subsidizing discriminationinadertently or otherwise if you choose to discriminate or ignore discriminatory activities within the realm of your organizational control then you will not be aided and abetted in doing so through the use of taxpayer moneys allow me to briefly review the problems presented by the supreme court decisions in grove city and darrone and to explain further why i believe remedial legislation is necessary grove city college a private coeducational liberal arts college refused to sign the assurance of compliance certification under title ix grove city college asserted that it received no federal financial assistancethat is that it was not a recipient under title ix and consequently was not subject to the discrimination prohibitions of that statute the facts in the case were that no direct federal assistance went to the college but that some of the students attending grove city college received federal basic educational opportunity grants the supreme court held first that grove city was a recipient under title ix because receiving federal financial assistance includes federal aid to a student who uses the funds at a particular institution but the supreme court went on to construe program or activity as not meaning the operations of the entire college but only the student financial aid office that is where the beog money in fact ultimately went on virtually the same day in the darrone case the supreme court also gave the same restrictive interpretation to program or activity in section 50 1 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 immediately there was a critical reaction to the narrow and potentially damaging interpretation given to program or activity in both of these decisions in an education context the supreme court interpretation means for example that if sex discrimination occurs in the history department of a college but no federal funds expressly go to that particularly department then the college could continue to receive federal assistance despite this discrimination importantly since the phrase program or activity is also present in title vi and the age discrination act that same programspecific construction could be applied in cases under those laws soon after the supreme court action legislation was introduced both in the senate and in the house of representative to respond to the gave city problem these bills were intended to restore the four relevant laws to their status prior to the grove city decision the house bill in the 98th congress was favorably reported by both the education and labor committee and the judiciary committee this legislation passed the house of representatives on june 26 1984 by a vote of 375 to 32 however disagreement over the intended and actual scope of the bills language resulted time ran out and the senate did not take final action that bill ran into difficulty principally because it contained a broad and arguably ambiguous definition of recipient the bills definition differed in certain respects from the existing regulatory definitions of recipient for each of the four laws concern was expressed that this legislation was in fact being used to expand the coverage of these four laws to entirely new categories or classes of recipients subsequent versions reflect a sincere attempt to respond to those early criticism s 557 the bill we consider today is based upon a substitute developed from weeks of bipartisan negotiations in the spring of 1985 those negotiationsinvolving democrats and republicans from from both tile judiciary committee and the education and labor committeebrought about important improvements in the bill under this revised and still relevant format the existing regulatory definitions of recipient are left unchanged and importantly the exclusions for ulti ate beneflciaries farmers student medicare and medicaid recipients food stamp recipients and social security beneficiarieswhich are contained in three out of four regulatory definitions are retained so for example entities or persons such as farmers that are not recipents under the law now because they are ultimate beneficiaries would not have their status changed furthermore s 557 defines the phrase program or activity and attempts to bring that definition in line with executive branch enforcement policy as it existed prior to grove city and darrone this makes good sense in that it was the supreme courts restrictive interpretation of that phrase which prompts our legislative reaction under s 557 coverage under the four antidiscrimination laws would extend to first departments or agencies of a state or a local government second colleges universities or public systems of higher education third local education agencies or other elementary or secondary systems fourth corporations partnerships or other private or nonprofit organizations and fifth any other entity established by two or more of those previous entities in the case of this last cater ory other entity coverage presumably would occur depending upon whether or not the resulting entity is analogous in structure and purpose to the previous categories in the specified list s 557 also intends to leave the socalled pinpointing doctrine on fund termination unchanged see senate report no 10064 p 20 the landmark case on pinpointing is taylor v finch 414 f 2d 1068 1969 that doctrine holds that once a program or activity is receiving federal financial assistance and discrimination is found to exist then only those funds which actually support the discrimination would be cut off so for example if a municipal housing authority is found to be discriminating on the basis of race or sex or age or handicap only housing moneys are potentially terminated by not transportaon moneys or education moneys while as a practical matter fund termination is a negotiation tool and is utilized only as a last resort the intent of this legislation is to limit the potential scope of fund termination to those funds which actually have a specific nexus to the discrimination that is found as the members of this house know progress on the civil rights restoration act has been stalled since early 1985 because of a dispute over the possible abortion implications of this legislation now with adoption of the df nforth amendment in the senate ard the inclusion of that abortion neutral language in the bill before us today that 3year impasse is over for many of us a compromise on the abortion issue was a necessary prerequisite to the enactment of this legislation while that debate was understandable and important its unfortunate side effect was to distract many members from focusing on the very valid and fundamental policy reasons justifying the remaining portions of the bill but now that this issue has been satisfactorily resolved let us not be further distracted with passage colleges and universities will not be able to receive federal aid and discriminate against women or blacks or the handicapped in their admissions policies or hiring practices state and local governments similarly cannot continue to receive financial aid without assuring federal enforcement officials about equal opportunity in employment and nondiscriminatory disposition of those funds components of corporations will also have to comply with the basic elements of the four applicable civil rights laws today the house of representatives is faced with a policy choice that should not and cannot ignore the original rationale that prompted the enactment of these four laws these statutes were intended as deterrents to institutional discrimination and that fact ought not be overlooked or aban doned in this debate ultimately the question for us to answer is whether or not we want these laws to be enforced in a comprehensive and effective manner"], [0.5078216791152954, 0.5078216791152954, 0, "i rise in strong support of the substitute to h r 2707 this compromise based on earlier houseand senatepassed bills provides a

unwise development title iii contains a few miscellaneous provisions related to water resources allow me to highlight some of the key provisions in title i the disaster relief and emergency assistance amendments of 1988 the new bill builds upon the strong base of the housepassed bill it clarifies the federal governments response authorities and financial responsibilities and establishes a stronger partnership among federal state local and private entities it strengthens femas existing program by adding needed uniformity consistency timeliness and above all else fairness we have also made additional technical and conforming amendments to the 1974 statute to reflect new laws and to incorporate changes made by h r 2707 for example we have rewritten the section entitled protection of the environment which involves the national environmental policy act of 1969 our intent is not to change the substantive requirements under current law in any way instead we intend only to make technical and conforming changes title i reorganizes the disaster relief program to clearly define presidential authority to respond to major disasters and emergencies major disasters would include primarily natural catastrophes or in certain instances nonnatural catastrophes while emergencies would include any occasion or instance in which federal assistance was necessary however we do not intend for emergency declarations to be available in responding to public health problems such as disease epidemics or environmental or nuclear catastrophes for which federal assistance is already available nor do we intend to interfere with existing federal emergency authorities or the comprehensive crime control acts law enforcement emergency assistance provisions perhaps most importantly the bill clarifies cost sharing requirements under the law establishing a minimum federal share of 75 percent for major disaster and emergency expenses the bill also details what eligible assistance state and local governments and private nonprofit facilities should expect to receive h r 2707 provides gieater recogtilon of hazard mitigation by encouraging measures to prevent a recurrence of a major disaster or minimize the damages that might be sustained the bill authorizes federal grants for hazard mitigation and increases the amounts of money available for disaster preparedness grants to the states the limited increase in federal funding should provide enormous dividends in the future because local governments and private nonprofit facilities will find greater incentives to prevent rathor than merely react to disasters the bill also injects greater discipline into the planning procedures of state and local governments by conditioning future federal disaster assistance upon flood insurance requiring floodprone areas to obtain flood insurance and participate in the national flood insurnace program should save the federal treasury millions of dollars in the future h r 2707 also makes administrative reforms in response to femas 1086 proposed regulations this legislation contains important provisons on eligibility of communities and private nonprofit facilities for federal assistance the date of eligibility and the ability to advance payments our substitute modifies the definition of public and private nonprofit facilities we have added the term essential services of a governmental nature to the general public to provide flexibility not to encourage unsupported broadreaching expansions of the definition we also deleted the amendment to the definition of local government contained in the housepassed bill the house public works and transportation committee however has not changed its view of the need to include special purpose districts when appropriate instead we have agreed to retain the definition in current law and to place a report and wait requirement on fema if and when they ever decide to change their interpretation of the definition in no way are we encouraging fema to revise their current interpretation new section 424 of the bill addresses prodisaster expenses our intent is to encourage individuals and communities to take prudent emergency preparedness measures immediately preceding an incident which may ultimately qualify as major disaster such activities include but are not limited to issuance of warnings public health and safety information mobilization of emergeilcy resources and construction or preparation of temporary hazard reduction facilities which might reduce or eliminate damages from an impending disaster incident longterm or permanent measures are not contemplated by this section we recognize fema should have flexibility in determining threshold questions of eligibility however we do not condone and will not allow arbitrary decisions based solely on sliding scales or mathematical formulas involving population or income therefore we have retained the house bills provision that prohibits fema from using a sliding scale or mathematical formula as the sole basis for eligibility determinations we intend that such determinations be made on the basis of other factors such as but not limited to the following first disaster in the current or previous fiscal year for which the governor has declared a state of emergency second hazard mitigation efforts taken by state or local governments third significant loss of tax base fourth imminent threats to public health and safety fifth extent and type of insurance available sixth assistance available from other federal programs and seventh impact of damages on affected individuals as well as states and local governments h r 2707 will also help to cut the redtape experienced by individuals and state local and private nonprofit entities people should be able to receive assistance when they truly need it and without endless hassles this bill helps ensure that happens without creating a drain on the federal treasury or unnecessarily increasing the federal governments role title ii has been modified significantly to reflect concems of fema the corps and the administration the gentleman from new york mr nowakj is to be commended for his hard work and leadership on this as a result we have a workable program the administration can support title ii encourages wise shoreline development and environmentally protective responses but steers clear of any kind of federal land use planning the basic message in title i is we know we cant completely control the lake levels just as we cant control mother nature but we can minimize or prevent future damages who do this is title it by providing technical assistance and establishing incentives for improved lakeshore management and environmentally sensitive development we encourage the great lakes states to participate in the coastal zone management program adopt tough erosion setback requirements and not build in the flood zone title ii also authorizes the corps of engineers to provide emergency assistance to prevent flooding and high water level damage to provide technical assistance and to complete and disseminate information on water levels in addition title ii encourages where feasible the use of natural nonstructural measures to control shoreline erosion this is an important environmentally protective policy and i am proud to support it title ii also encouragesbut does not requirethe use of dredged material for beach nourishment when feasible and mutually acceptable to the parties nothing in this bill however conditions the issuance of a section 10 or section 404 permit on using dredged material for such purposes the coastal barrier resources provisions in title ii direct the secretary of interior to identify great lakes shorelines eligible for inclusion in the coastal barrier resources system let me commend the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman from ohio for their work in this area under section 204 privately owned unprotected and undeveloped areas could be recommended for inclusion in the resources system congress would then have to approve the recommendation this section is consistent with the whole thrust of title i1 it will discourage unwise development in areas with high risk of erosion or flooding it makes sense not to use federal money to build in flood zones at the same time we are encouraging setback and flood plain requirements and paying subsidized insurance this study also makes good environmental sense it may lead to the inclusion of certain great lakes areas in the coastal barriers resource system we need to protect these barrier islands we also need to protect the federal treasury the coastal barriers resources system does that by banning the use of federal dollars for development along shorelines

authorization bill rept no 100825 many members of the committee expressed dismay over the grossly inflated funding levels that were authorized it was difficult to believe that the committee which approved only 1 to 3 percent funding increases for a variety of important health programs would approve approximately 20 percent yearly increases in cpbs funding ceilings and would authorize for fiscal year 1991 nearly twice as much money as cpb received 6 years before it was even more difficult to believe that either the house or the senate would routinely approve the authorized funding levels proposed in their original bills especially when cpbs actual appropriated amount for fiscal year 1991 was nearly 60 million less than the proposed authorization many members of both bodies wanted to approve a cpb authorization bill with more realistic funding numbers that would not be vetoed by the president after extensive discussions among the administration and house and senate members a compromise package was assembled that is contained in the substitute before the house this package has already been approved by the senate if the house approves it as well the office of management and budget has agreed not to recommend a presidentiai veto thus the house has a historic opportunity to appove and to have enacted the first cpb authorizing legislaton in this decade legislation that will mandate prudent funding levels and increased reliance by public broadcasting stations on nonfederal sources of funding first and foremost h r 4118 as amended by this substitute will drastically reduce the funding ceilings proposed in the original house and senate authorization bills three examples will illustrate just how significant those cuts are first the new authorization level for fiscal 1991 245 millionwill be only 2 million over the approximately 243 million already appropriated by congress nearly 10 million less than the existing fiscal 1990 authorization of 254 million and nearly 60 million less than the 304 million originally proposed second the new fiscal year 1993 funding level 285 millionwill be about 20 million less than the 404 million originally proposed and even about 20 million less than the funds originally proposed by this legislation for fiscal 1991 304 million third the authorized funding increases are only 20 million for each of the 3 years as opposed to 50 million originally this legislation also requires public broadcasting stations to rely more heavily on private instead of federal funding now for every 2 privately raised by public broadcasting stations 1 can be received from the federal government this is termed the 2toi or 50 percent matching fund h r 4118 changes the matching fund ratio to require public stations to raise 2 50 in private funds before they could receive 1 from cpb this new 2 to1 or 40 percent matching fund is a return to the ratio contained originally in the public broadcasting act of 1967 it also reflects the fact that public broadcasting has never been in better financial health according to a cpb report the total income of public broadcasting in fiscal year 1987 grew 14 percent to about 1 30 billion the same report states that private funding increased by nearly 11 percent to over 1 billion given the fiancial health of the public system adjustment of the matching fund ratio should be actively considered as part of each cpb authorization process we hope this adjustment serves as the starting point of a debate about the proper ratio of pdvatetofederal funding support should be as public broadcasting moves into the 21st century finally this bill mandates greater accountability ovo the extra 200 million authorized for the stitellite interconnection fund specifically cpb and the public stations must report to congress in 1990 on the final satellite system selected whether it would be more costeffective to lease transponder capacity rather than to purchase a new satellite and whother private funds are available to public broadcasting that could be used instead of the public money authorized through this legislation we applaud this amendment cpb is authorized nearly 1 billion between fiscal years 1991 and 1993 through this bill in return gpb should at least be required to exhaust every possible avenue to use nonfederal funds and attempt to lighten the burden on the taxpayers as much as possible this provision is not a new or radical concept in public broadcasting it is only an extension of the partnership of public and private funding embodied in all public broadcasting funding through devices like the matching fund which are designed to give public stations the incentive to rely on nonfederal funds for years congress engaged in a sleight of hand game with public broadcasting funding that should be the envy of card sharps everywhere with one hand we authorized great sums of money for public broadcasting with the other hand we appropriated only a small sum more than the previous year by now the game is old hat and a comfortable fiction of all concerned unfortunately the game has done real harm to the public broadcasting system because it kept public broadcastings mission and funding locked in the past instead of moving toward the future these disproportionate authorizations only delayed responsible debate on how the public broadcasting system can grow without further infusions of taxpayer dollars in the grammrudmanhollings era when many more essential programs are frozen or limited to small increases both sides know that any significant expansion in federal fundng for public broadcasting is not possible the public broadcasting act described federal funding of public broadcasting programming as seed money that was necessary because sufficient federal funds were not avalatle it is clear that those seeds have borne fruit and that requests for increased authorizations should be evaluated much more

proprietary school loan volume guaranteed 23 837 sls loans in may 20 301 or 85 percent of these sls loans wont to borrowers attending proprietary schools reports also indicate that financial aid officers are frontending student financial assistance with sls loans rather than having students apply for needbased pell grants and more subsidized needstested guaranteed student loans first because both palls and gsls require such a determination of need the application process for grants and lowinterest loans is more complex and lengthy additionally gsls provide a smaller loan amount of 2 625 for first year borrowers and poll grants require additional administrative record keeping and reporting by school financial aid officials my concern is that such frontending of financial assistance witi sls loans will increase both the number of defaulters given the repayment schedule and the amount of dollars in default given that borrowers may receive up to 4 000 in a single payment early in their educational programs connecting sls loans with other needbased financial assistance will remove any possibility of frontending financial aid with supplemental loans for independent undergraduate students h r 4639 requires both an eligibility determination and application for both pell grants and gsls before applying for an sls loan graduate and professional students must apply for the gsl before making application for an sls loan additionally for the purpose of calculating the sls loan limit the amount of the gsl eligibility will be subtracted with other financial aid certified by the institution from the students estimated cost of attendance such requirements are not intended to limit legitimate access to sls loans particularly because many students including graduate and professional students use both gsl and sls loans to meet the cost of attendance our intent is that students borrow a guaranteed student loan for which they are eligible before making use of the more expensive sls loan h r 4639 also requires multiple disbursement of sls loans in two cash payments which is in line with disbursements made in the gsl program providing as much as 4 000 in a single payment early in the educational or training program rfreans that dropouts who account for a great proportion of defaulters in the gsl program will be droppingout with significantly higher debt burdensdebt burdens which qill in most cases become defaulted loans cbo projects a 9 5percent default rate for this program which given the exponential growth in loan volume means that we may be facing the addition of another 180 million in defaults to the projected 1 6 billion in defaults in the gsl program both for students and for the integrity of the federal loan programs the explosive growth in supplemental loans as the primary sources of aid is a potential disaster because of the high volume of supplemental loans in the fourth quarter of the fiscal yearjuly through septemberthis legislation must be enacted prior to july 1 1988 if we are to realize substantial reductions in potential defaults the corrective measures embodied in h r 4639 have the support of the administration the american council on education and 13 other higher education associations the national association of trade and technical schools and the association of independent colleges and schools which represents proprietary career schools i urge my colleagues to support this legislation today and to close loopholes leading to abuses in the supplemental loans for students program"],

construction appropriations subcommittee the gentleman from north carolina for his diligence in bringing this bill to the floor the committee staff majority minority deserve our thanks for their professionalism in assisting with drafting this bill as always chairman hefner has made very effort to ensure that this bill has been crafted in a bipartisan manner he has made sure that each member of the subcommittee without regard to what side of the aisle they are on was able to participate in crafting this bill the outcome of his efforts represent a balanced bill ih r 4586 provides an 8 8 billion appropriation for military construction and family housing during fiscal year 1989 not included in this bill but scored against it is a 214 million advance appropriation mandated in fiscal year 1987 bringing the total to 9 01 billion this represents approximately a 2 5percent real increase over last year and is in line with the spending limits of the economic summit the chairman of our subcommittee has done an excellent job in outlining the contents of h r 4586 in his statement he spoke of savings realized in this bill i would like to elaborate on a few specific projects which provide savings the blb avionics facility at tinker air force base ok costing 11 4 million will result in a contract savings of 50 million per year reconfiguration of the airframes support facility at corpus christi army depot tx at a cost of 4 9 million is estimated to produce an annual offset of 4 4 million each year over the 25year economic life of the project the net present value of these savings discounted at 10 percent is 39 4 million construction of the target maintenance facility at naval air station north island ca at a cost of 2 8 million will result in avoiding an investment of 19 5 million to purchase new targets and an annual transportation cost of 216 000 the sum of 1 6 million to purchase the walter reed inn eliminating an annual 700 000 lease cost construction of 1 000 units of family housing is estimated to result in the reduction of between 5 5 and 6 million in annual housing allowances this bill includes 284 million for construction of 3 200 units resulting in an annual savings of approximately 19 2 million several intangible benefits of this bill are obvious but cannot be quantified the commitment demonstrated by the construction of new barracks or a facility that enhances the appearance and the efficiency of the workplace may convince a soldier to reenlist avoiding the expense of training his replacement and improvements to health safety and environmental aspects of our installations help to prevent the loss of life lost time injuries and longterm health problems of our service members and civilian employees i would also take to outline some of the major components of ii r 4586 the sum of 173 million of the 191 million requested for strategic homeporting at 9 of the 10 proposed sites although personally i oppose the homeporting conceptmy role is not to be obstructionist when the committee and the congress have supported this initiative the sum of 214 million in advance appropriations for the light infantry division at fort drum ny and 35 9 million for fort wainwright ak the sum of 77 5 million for the continuation of the beddown of the b2 stealth bomber at whiteman air force base mo the sum of 3 05 million for troop support facilities at palmerola honduras the sum of 26 million for 16 child care centers to meet the increased demand due to todays allvolunteer force the sum of 99 million for the foreign currency fluctuation accountoffset by a 113 million reduction in overseas projectsto help ease the construction backlog experienced by the services due to the instability of exchange rates for chemical demilitarization the committee has deferred the requested 49 6 million for an ammunition demilitarization facility at tooele army depot ut in addition to this construction request the facility requires 107 million in process equipment were funding is under the jurisdiction of the defense appropriations subcommittee the committee recognizes th t there are contractual advantages to combining all costs for construction equipment and operations into a single procurement and has deferred this project without prejudice pending a decision by the defense subcommittee on the equipment portion of this project the committee has provided 8 4 million for a training facility at aberdeen proving ground md however we have fenced this money until the congress approves initial construction and procurement for the first ammunition demilitarization facility the sum of 502 million for the unitedstates contribution to the nato infrastructure fund while this represents an increase of 129 million above last years appropriation the increase is attributed mainly to the foreign currency shortfall the committee supports the unitedstates commitment to nato and is pleased that the administration and dod are giving burdensharing the attention it deserves we have required the department to submit a progress report by february 15 1989 on further actions taken by nato allies and japan to assume a greater share of the common defense burden to promote further burdensharing the committee denied 25 million for programs we believe should be pursued either by natoinfrastructure or hostnation support the bill carries a provision initiated last year prohibiting the use of any military construction and family housing funds for the relocation of the 401st tactical wing from torrejon spain the sum of 3 3 billion or 37 percent of the total bill for construction and operation and maintenance of family housing the committee strongly believes that ownership of family housing units is preferable to leasing for economic as well as managerial reasons leasing expenses included in this bill for 1 year amount to 378 million therefore a general provision has betn included in the bill which directs the department to submit a legislative proposal for an installment purchase program for family housing and to implement a pilot program for 3 000 units in its 1990 budget request these major components are necessary but i would like to remind my colleagues what this bill really provides while there are many projects important to our national defensethe majority are important to the men and women of our armed forces while we invest billions of dollars for weapons systemsmany of which are more glamourous than a hardstanda concrete slab to relieve our soldiers from working in the mud snow and icewe tend to forget the most important factor to our defensethose men and women who put our systems to use that is what the military construction appropriation bill is about we dont have the constituency of support those glamourous weapons systems havethe men and women of our armed forces and their families are our constituencywe provide for their working environment their housing their hospitals and clinics their chapels and their childcare centers in conclusion h r 4586 represents a balanced wellcrafted billit provides the necessary military construction and family housing projects to protect and enhance our investment it is a bipartisan bill and within the budget i urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this measure today i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5073566436767578, 0.5073566436767578,

the 70th anniversary of estonias independence unfortunately for the people of these countries and all the baltic states these will be muted celebrations because for the past 48 years the soviet union has denied freedom and independence to these brave people during its occupation of the baltic states the soviets have overtaken a continuous campaign to virtually eliminate the cultural heritage traditions languages and religion of the lithuanian estonian and latvian people in recognition of the denial of human rights to the baltic people i am reintroducing today two resolutions calling for full freedom and independence of the baltic states and expressing the sense of the congress that our nation should do everything possible through diplomatic channels to see that soviet personnel are removed from these occupied lands these resolutions reaffirm the policy of the united states to refuse to recognize the unlawful soviet occupation of the baltic states and to continue to maintain diplomatic relations with the independent republics of lithuanla estonia and latvia as independent states soviet leaders have widely publicized their new policy of glasnost with the announced intendion of expanding the freedoms and rights of the soviet people if the soviet union is sincere in this regard it should immediately grant the long denied independence to the peaceful and freedom loving people of the baltic states who pose no security risk to the soviet union the resolutions i introduce today the text of which follow my remarks encourage the president to enter into discussions with soviet leaders to end soviet occupation of these lands release baltic political prisoners and restore the selfdetermination of the baltic people through our efforts to recognize the independence of lithuania estonia and latvia we call world attention to the soviet denial of human rights and freedom to the people of these nations for almost half of this century the baltic people are proud and strong and will never relinquish their quest to regain the independence that has been stropped of them by the soviet union and they are deserving of our moral and diplomatic support to help them achieve their dream of the reestablishment of thre truly independent states of lithuania estonia and latvia 1t con res whereas the united states since its inception has been committed to the principle of selfdetermination whereas this essential moral principle is also affirmed in the charter of the united nations whereas the union of soviet socialist republics is according to its constitution a volunary federation of autonomous republics whereas the three baltic republics the republic of lithuania the republic of latvia and the repubic of estonia did not become member republics of the union of soviet socialist republics voluntarily but rather were occupied militarily by russian armed forces in the early days of world war ii and subsequently incorporated by force in to the union of soviet socialist republics and have since been governed by governments approved by and subservient to the government of the union of soviet socialist republics whereas the ethnic makeup of the baltic peoples the lithuanians latvians and estonians is distinctly foreign in language culture common traditions and religion from that of the russian people whereas by deportation and dispenslon of the native populations of the baltic states to siberia and by a massive colonization effort in which russian colonists replace the displaced native peoples the soviet union threatens complete elimination of the baltic peoples as a culturally geographically and politically distinct and ethnically homogeneous population whereat despite such treatment the spirit of the citizens of the baltic states is not broken and the desire of the citizens of the baltic states for national independence remains unabated whereas the united states has consistently refused to recognize the unlawful soviet occupation of the baltic states and has continued to maintain diplomatic relations with representatives of the independent republics of lithuania latvia and estonia and whereas the united nations and the united statcs delegation to the united nations have consistently upheld the right of selfdetermination of the people of those countries in asia and africa that are or have been under foreign imperialist rule now therefore be it resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that it is the sense of the congress that 1 the president and the secretary of state should take all necessary steps to bring the baltic states question before the united nations and to urge that the united nations request the soviet union a to withdraw all russian and other nonnative troops agents colonists and controls from the republics of lithuania latvia and estonia and b to return all baltic exiles from siberia and from prisons and labor camps in the soviet union 2 until the baltic states become independent the secretary of state should through such channels as the united states information agency and other information agencies of the united states government do his utmost to bring the matter of the baltic states to the attention of all nations by means of special radio programs and pubilcations 3 the united states should not agree to the recognition by any international conference of the soviet unions unlawful annexation of lithuania latvia and estonia and it should remain the policy of the united states not to recognize in any way the annexation of the baltic states by the soviet union 4 the president should require that all government map publishers and should request that all private map publishers show on all maps of europe the republics of lithuania latvia and estonia as independent states with a footnote explaining that the military occupation and forced incorporation into the soviet union of lithuania latvia and estonia has never been recognized by the united states 5 the right of selfdetermination should be returned to the peoples of lithuania latvia and estonia through free elections conducted under the auspices of the united nations after soviet withdrawal from the baltic states and 6 the right of selfdetermination should be made a prime political objective of the united nations and should be accorded through free elections under the auspices of the united nations to all peoples now involuntarily subjugated to soviet communism h con rzs whereas the united states does not recognize the illegal annexation by the soviet union of the baltic nations of estonia latvia and lithuania whereas the united states as a member of the united nations has pledged to uphold the ideals of the united nations charter and to take joint and separate action to promote universal respect for and obserance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion whereas during the 83rd congress the select committee to investigate communist aggression of the house of representatives thoroughly investigated the seizure of the baltic nations by the soviet union and in its third interim report concluded that the evidence is overwhelming and conclusive that estonia latvia and lithuania were forcibly occupied and illegally annexed by the union of soviet socialist republics whereas the united states as a signatory to the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe endorsed principle viii concerning equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples which states all peoples always have the right if full freedom to determine when and as they wish their internal and external political status without external interference and to pursue as they wish their political economic social and cultural development and the participating states also recall the importance of the elimination of any form of violation of this principle and whereas the house of representatives in the 96th congress by adopting h con res 200 reaffirmed the united states policy concerning the baltic nations and thereby urged positive actions now therefore be it resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that it is the sense of the congress that the president should 1 enter into discussions with the soviet union a for the withdrawal of all nonestonan nonlatvlan and nonlithuanian military political administrative and police personnel from estonia latvia and lithuania respectively and b for the release of political prisoners of estonian latvian or lithuanian nationality from prisons labor camps pyschlatric institutions and other detention centers within the soviet union and their return to estona latvia and lithuania respectively 2 instruct the united states delegation to each review meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in europe to seek consideration of the following matters a the illegal annexation of estonia latvia and lithuania by the soviet union and b the denial of selfdetermination and territorial integrity of estonia latvia and lithuania by the soviet union and 3 make every effort to gain the support and cooperation of all nations to

to speak in support of the provision in this amendment to establish a system to identify the owners of all unitedstates vessels this provision represents the efforts of many groups including the maritime law association the american bar association the national marine bankers association and the administration this system will primarily benefit law enforcement officials but others including state boating officials and commercial and recreational vessel owners insurers national boating organizations and financiers will benefit from the system the vessel identification system in this provision will for the first time provide a way to identify the owners of all commercial and recreational vessels in this country since the late 1970s the merchant marine and fisheries committee of which i am the ranking minority member has received testimony on the need to clearly and easily establish the owners and identities of vessels thousands of vessels are stolen annually in this country and law enforcemernt officials have no way to identify the true owners of those vessels and to effectively track the interstate movements of those vessels the federal aviation administration currently maintains a system to identify the owners of aircraft and title viii of h r 5210 contains provisions reported by the public works and transportation committee to strengthen that system i understand that many of the problems assqelated with identifying the ownership of aircraft also exist with regard to vessels and should be alleviated by the vessel identification system earlier this congress introduced a bill h r 3298 to address many of these problems rhis vessel identification system is required to be established by the secretary of transportation the secretary may require that the coast guard carry out this program but this is not required by the provision this system should be established in the most costefficient manner and combined if possible with other information systems the secretary currently maintains the system of information the secretary maintains on documented vessels would be an appropriate information system to combine with the vessel information system because the identification information maintained by the secretary on documented vessels is part of the overall system of identification information for all vessels of the united states another reason to combine these systems is that the fees charged by the secretary under the ship mortgage act 1920 as amended by this provision may be sufficient to modernize the vessel information system maintained by the socretary under that act and also to offset the costs of establishing the vessel information system under this provision states are encouraged to participate in the system by making ownership information available on vessels in their states to the secretary of transportation participation is voluntary on the part of states but as a benefit to vessel owners and financiers vessel mortgages filed in participating states with approved titling systems will be given preferred status currently available to federally recorded vessel mortgages in addition if a state is employed by the secretary to collect the 1 per vessel fee authorized by this provision the state may retain half of the amounts collected to provide vessel identification information to the secretary this purpose would include making updates and improvements to state vessel titling and numbering schemes to more effectively provide information to the secretary total fees paid by boaters may stay the same or actually decrease because states will reap the efficiency of making certain improvements to their numbering systems with these funds i believe that these inducements will encourage a broad participation in the vessel identification system by the states this provision includes a codification of the ship mortgage act recently reported by the merchant marine and fisheries committee h rept 100918 with certain changes explained in the sectionbysection analysis attached to this statement it contains procedures to support the preferred status for state filed or recorded financing instruments and many others to complement the new vessel identification system for these reasons it is an important part of the vessel identification system the codification recognizes the prevalence of revolving credit loans in modern financing and allows their use in vessel financing it eliminates a number of useless formalities such as requiring that a mortgage be endorsed on a vessels document or the needless requirement that the coast guard be notified when a partial payment is made on a mortgage with respect to encouraging the financing of vessels the codification establishes a nationwide indexing system which will allow a preferred ship mortgage to be valid from the date of filing this will eliminate the current 8month wait before a mortgage actually grants the security interest important to consumers and banks while it will take some time to get this program operating i am convinced that the new system will be a vast improvement over current labor inten sive and time consuming procedures in use today again modern computer technology can easily handle these tasks septem ber 22 1988 i want to thank walteir jones tie distinguished chairman of the merchant marine and fisheries committee for his leadership in introducing and developing the ship mortgage act codification and also for his support of the vessel identification system in this provision i also want to thiank the chairmans staff for their hard work and dedication in helping to develop this provision finally i want to commend the groups i mentioned earlier who have worked so closely with the committee and have been such a help in the development of this important piece of legislation the attached sectionbysection supplements this statement with an explanation of the new vessel identification system the ship mortgage act codification and other supplemental provisions also attached is the administrations letter of support of this provision the vessei identification provision

some of the history from the paper prepared by paul michael blitz archivist of the heritage society of essex and middle river essex maryland has a long and proud history the first settlers of the area like the rest of america were the indians over 700 susquehannoughs inhabited the area the fierce and warlike susquehannoughs often waged war with the massawomekes or the iroquois captain john smith pounder of the colony of jamestown in virginia sailed up the chesapeake bay in 1608 he was exploring back river and middle river or as he called them smals poynt and willowbyes when he first encountered the susquehannoughs he was very impressed when they prostrated themselves in adoration of the european settlers like the roman empire the susquehannoughs were defeated no not by a neighboring tribe but by smallpox we have evidence that the indians lived in this area because arrowheads were found at coxs point and deep creek which are on display at the heritage society museum in 1634 the colony of maryland was founded by 1658 settlers started moving into the back river neck peninsula one of the early families who settled here were the stansburys the stansbury family was a prominent family who also lived in the patapsco neck area reverend tobias stansbury had a farm located in the patapsco neck it was on this farm where general robert ross was killed during the battle of north point in the war of 1812 another member of the stansbury family elijah stansbury would later become mayor of baltimore in 1659 cecil calvert second lord baltimore granted 420 acres of land along the chesapeake bay to a prominent virginia planter named william ball later william ball would become the greatgreat grandfather of another prominent virginia planter named george washington today the tract of land william ball received is now rocky point golf course the manor house named for ball is ballestone and is open to the public by the 1700s most of what is now essex was made up of land grants in 1736 thomas hines received 261 acres of land called hines purchase this land grant would later become essex the original hines purchase marker is still standing on the corner of mace avenue and franklin avenue industry came to the area in 1744 when the principlo co opened an iron furnace at the head of back river augustine washington and his sons lawrence and george washington had stock in the company a mansion was built for the washington family to stay when they visited the iron furnace later the name was changedto the locust grove ore mine it was in operation from 18451885 during the civil war it made weapons and employed 100 people the locust grove iron furnace built zion evangelical lutheran church for its workers to have a place to worship in the 1800s elijah taylor bought farmland which he called paradise farm this was the first time the area was united under one nameparadise around 1860 james c tutchton and his wife sarah rented paradise farm from jacob taylor later the taylor family decided to have paradise resurveyed in 1909 the taylor land co divided the farm into lots and created the town of essex maryland named after a county in england the taylor land co also donated lots for st johns lutheran church essex methodist church the volunteer fire company and the portable schools essex was a growing community and was called the riqing suburb of the east

and taylor avenue some of the streets in essex were named for the taylor family these include taylor avenue franklin avenue and margaret avenue in 1910 the oldest store in essex was opened by henry guttenburger his son john now in his eighties still runs the store in 1915 the vigilant volunteer fire company was formed located at 518 eastern boulevard it was the first firehouse in essex up to that time essex had no fire protection upset by this a group of concerned citizens formed the volunteer fire company because of the growth and development of essex bucket brigades were useless after realizing this the vigilant fire company turned to horse drawn wagons they too became obsolete with the advent of the automobile motorized fire pumps replaced horse drawn wagons the vigilant fire company purchased a 1914 bessmer motorized chassis it had the modern features of two pumps fire hoses and a 40 foot ladder a 35 gallon chemical tank was mounted behind the drivers seat by 1919 there were two paid fire houses in baltimore county one in towsontown the county seat and the other one was in catonsville in that same year essex had paid firemen stationed at the vigilant fire company the volunteer firemen soon became paid firemen and established a building and loan association which exists today in 1920 a new firehouse was built next door to the vigilant building and loan this fire

"i rise today in support of the conference report on h r 3 the trade and international economic policy reform act as a member of the house committee on agriculture and the committee on education and labor i have been afforded the opportunity to help mold this final product before us today i served on both subconlerence no 6 dealing with agricultural trade and subconference no 8 dealing with education and labor but before i begin my discussion of the particular provisions of this major conference report i would like to answer one very basic question why at this time in our history do we need a comprehensive revision and reform of our trade laws one needs only to examine a few statistics to illustrate the magnitude of the problem our nation currently faces in 1986 the unitedstates merchandise trade deficit was estimated at 166 billionan amount that exceeded the gross national product of all but 20 countries in the world over a 6year period from 1980 to 1986 the unitedstates trade deficit increased sixfold making it the highest in world history this decline was seen vividly in the agricultural sectorpreviously an american stronghold in 1979 and 1980 the united states enjoyed a trade surplus in agricultural commodities of more than 30 billion by 1986 that surplus had declined to 4 billion to illustrate the shift in international commerce europe during the same period moved from importing 25 million tons of grain to exporting 16 million tons admittedly recent statistics indicate a decreasing trade deficit in terms of real net exports the deficit dropped from 162 billion in the third quarter of 1986 to 140 billion a year later but real exports measure only the quantity not the value of trade the deficit in dollar terms has not reversed during this same period economists note that imports rose only about 3 percent in quantity but because import prices rose almost 13 percent the end result was a 12percent import rise in dollar terms this rise in import values all but offset a 16percent increase in exports over the same period our nation must make a ommitment to real progress on international trade the longer we allow a massive trade deficit to exist the areater the burden on american citizens and their standard of living that is why i am supporting the conference report on h r 3 sone of the major provisions of this legislation include mandated retaliatory action by the unitedstates trade representative in cases involving foreign violations of trade agreements or other unjustifiable practices while the form of the retaliation is at the discretion of the ustr the action must be equivalent in value to the unfair prpctice exercised in extraordinary cases where unitedstates retaliatory action would have an adverse affect on the unitedstates economy grea~er than the benefits of retaliation no action will be taken ii 2349 changes to section 201 of the trade act of 1974 the socalled escape clause will shorten the period of time in which the international trade commission must make a determination as to serious injury to a domestic industry from 6 months to 120 days with a 30day extension authorized for extraordinarily complicated cases in addition domestic industries will be encouraged to undertake actions which will result in a positive adjustment to import competition extends the trade adjustment assistance program i lrc gh fiscal year 1993 and authorizes 980 million for the job training partnership act h r 3 contains many other significant provisions including the streamlining of our export control laws reforms in antidumping and countervailing duty laws extensions in preidential negoiiating authority for tariff and nontaiiff negotiations reforms in intellectualproperty rights under patents and copyrights and significant policy statements on international negotiations on exhange rates in addition provisions which i worked on in subconference negotiations dnserve specific mention due to the controversial nature of the labor provisions included in this bill i will discuss those provisions in a separate statement however i will discuss the education and agriculture provisions at this time the education provisions include a new 200 million fiscal year 1988 authorization for compensatory education demonstration grants for basic skids for secondary students and a 175 million fiscal year 1988 authoiization for t ie education for economic security act providing grants to upgrade education in math science foreign languages and c mputers the agriculture provisions of the bill are of major importance to international trade i will review some of the highlights of these provisions first the nonference agreement extends the authorization the export enhancement program ti rough 1990 and increases the ceiling on the value of commodities that can be used under the program from 1 5 billion to 2 5 billion second a triggored marketing loan for the 1990 crops of wheat feed grains and soybeans has been included in the bill this provision requires the president to submit a certification to congress no later than 45 days after january 1 1990 as to whether there has been significant progress toward achieving an agreement with respect to agricultural trade under the gatt talks if the president cannot certify that significant progress has been made the president must implement the marketing loan unless the president determines that to do so would harm further negotiations third with regard to the dairy export incentive program the conference requires that payments in commodities be made in the form of generic certificates further if the generic commodi y certificates are exchanged for diary products the secretary of agriculture must ensure that the dairy products are sold for export and that the sales do not displace usual unitedstates export sales of dairy products this deip provision is identical to legislation which i introduced in 1987h r 2986 the agriculture section also cortains signficant trade policy statements requires longterm strategy reports strengthens the usdas foreign agriculture service and authorizes certain trade studies one such study which i authored is of critical importance to the unitedstates dairy industry it requires the secretary of agriculture to report to the house and senate agriculture committees within 180 days of the bills enactment whether and to what extent the dairy price support program would be affected by a reduction in or elimination of limitations imposed on the importation of certain dairy products under section 22 of the agricultural adjustment act of 1933 this study is so critical because being debated right now in the gatt talks are proposals to eliminate all agriculture trade distorting policies in fact the unitedstatesnegotiators have proposed eliminating all such policies in gatt nations within 10 years we do not now know what such drastic agriculture policy changes would mean to our domestic dairy producers but we must find out before these talks are concluded the conference agreement on h r 3 is the product of years and years of congressional deliberations it is long overdue

the recent report of the board on agriculture of the national research council this report understanding agriculture new directions for education focuses on the important role of agricultural education in the secondary schools while the board report acknowledges the past successes of some educational programs it stresses the importance and necessity of building on these programs and going beyond them in scope and content it also stresses that agriculture is too important a topic to be taught only to the relatively small percentage of students considering careers in agriculture and pursuing vocational agriculture studies our farmers make up about 3 percent of our population yet they produce enough food and fiber to feed our entire nation in addition they successfully export agricultural products to many other countries throughout the world our nation is truly blessed with natural resources and these farmers who are among the most efficient in the world furthermore agriculture programs and policies play a very important role in many areas of domestic and world affairs yet it appears that the important role of the american farmer and the necessity of sound agricultural policy is not always understood or appreciated uniformly throughout this country this is why an understanding or what the report calls an agricultural literacy is so important the board defined it as a certain knowledge of food and fiber production processing and domestic and international marketing it also emphasized the importance of being able to make informed personal choices about diet and health the boards findings point to two basic challenges first agricultural education must become more than vocational agriculture and second that it is important to look at the present educational system and to improve upon it its recommendations are reasonable and workable as a farmer and a member of the agriculture committee i salute the board on agricul tures report furthermore i

cannot trust the soviets because for example they still will not get rid of the secret police they still are trying to steal our allies although things are turning around in afghanistan and everywhere
