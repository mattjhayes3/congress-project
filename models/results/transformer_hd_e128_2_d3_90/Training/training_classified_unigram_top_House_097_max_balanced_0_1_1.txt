are in a period of the highest unemployment among vietnam veterans since the end of the vietnam conflict in july nearly 700 000 vietnam veterans were out of work and adding discouraged workers that number soars too many of these veterans because of the time spent serving their country in the armed forces are still 2 to 4 years behind their nonveteran peers in job experience and proficiency consequently they have been the last hired and first fired during this time of recession and economic instability others have had psychological readjustment problems that have been severely exacerbated by unemployment and underemployment the team leader at one of the veterans administration vet centers recently stated this program the va psychological readjustment counseling program began in march of 1980 and clearly the situation for vietnam vets is the worst it has been in the last 2 years never have i seen people so desperate in terms of work you cannot expect anone to readjust without a job since last fall the subcommittee on education training and employment has held six hearings here in washington and one field hearing on the employment situation of vietnam veterans we thoroughly reviewed veterans employment programs administered by the veterans administration the department of labn the office of personnel management and the unitedstates postal service we also reviewed the education and training programs administered by the veterans administration the subcommittee concluded after evaluating the many hours of extensive testimony that unemployment and underemployment is a severe continuing problem for vietnam veterans and that legislation is necessary to strengthen and expand existing programs with innovative changes and additions to the existing structure and service on july 22 the committee on veterans affairs ordered reported h r 6794 the veterans employment and education assistance act of 1982 legislation designed to improve and make more effective the assistance congress has made available to help veterans obtain employment very briefly h r 6794 would strengthen and improve the veterans employment service in the department of labor in that regard the bill would clarify the duties and responsibilities of the position of the assistant secretary of labor for veterans employment a position established by the 96th congress as one of the provisions of public law 96466 h r 6794 would also clarify the responsibilities of the state directors of veterans employment who are under the jurisdiction of the assistant secretary of labor for veterans employment another major provision would require lineitem funding by the department of labor for the disabled veterans outreach program dvop addition ally the bill would require that department of labor funds allocated to grantees for veterans training employment counseling and job placement services shall be administered by the assistant secretary of labor for the granting of such fur ds as well as the accountability and performance of those who receive grant funds for veterans purposes this is a particularly significant provision in view of both the legislation we are considering today and the amendment to the recently passed h r 5320 the job training partnership act which set aside funds for the implementation of veterans programs specified in that legislation public law 96466 created the position of assistant secretary of labor for veterans employment asve in order to give more force clarity and direction to all veterans employment programs within the department of labor the asve is the chief advocate and adviser to the secretary of labor regarding these programs i believe it is vital to include in this legislation a reconfirmation of congressional intent regarding the authority and role of the asve the educational provisons of h r 6794 include minor program revisions and technical changes requested by the veterans administration one of the changes would repeal the requirement that vocational schools report on the number of graduates who during the preceding 2year period have obtained employment in the field for which the school provided training the repeal of the socalled 50 percent employment rule will save an estimated 223 000 in fiscal year 1983 there are a number of other minor provisions in this bill which are explained in the sectionbysection analysis which i will include at the end of my statement this bill has received the strong support and endorsement of the american legion the veterans of foreign wars the disabled american veterans the amvets and the vietnam veterans of america among other nationally recognized veterans organizations unemployment is a national problem which affects all members of the population veterans and noneterans alike there is no doubt however that many of the unemployment problems facing veterans particularly those with serviceconnected disabilities and vietnam era veterans are related to their military service although the congress has consistently placed particular emphasis on the unique nature of veterans employment and readjustment problems and targeted this group for specialized assistance h r 6794 would for the first time in law clearly state that veterans unemployment problems are a national responsibility this bill will not solve the employment problems of all these veterans it will however go a long way toward strengthening education programs and providing an improved and more effective program of job training and job placement for unemployment and underemployed veterans i want to express my thanks to all the members of the subcommittee on education training and employment and particularly margaret heckler the ranking minority member of the subcommittee for their help in the drafting of this bill i also want to 6hank the chairman of the full committee sonny montoomery his assistance and full support for this legislation is very much

and destroyed businesses and homes property damage in the county has totaled nearly 20 million and it will certainly take many years before the county can return to normal but for those fanllies that lost a loved one there will never be a return to normal while five counties in central and northern california were declared disaster areas and received presidential declarations the most significant damages caused by the storm were located in love creek in santa cruz county ten lives were lost along with nine homes which were destroyed due to the heavy rains which caused mudslides in the love creek area the h 3482 co slide in love creek affected not only those residents who experienced direct physical damage but also many residents of this area who have been faced with a unique and highly dangerous situation the drenching rains and mudslides of january led the army corps of engineers to conclude after a study of the love creek slide that the mountain area adjacent to the actual slide was unsafe therefore the residents were told that they could not return to their homes which were perfectly intact because of the unstable mountain following this situation the santa cruz county supervisors issued an abatement notice requiring the residents of love creek to either relocate their homes or remove the existing structures 29 families have been confronted with the sad and dreadful situation of virtually having their residencesranging in value from 100 000 to over 400 000become economically worthless in response to this situation the love creek residents have become eligible for loans which are offered to other disaster victims they are eligible for loans of up to 55 000 from the small business administration to help find another residence while the small business administration and other federalagencies are to be commended for providing some assistance in response to the disaster the sad fact is that the 55 000 loan limit offered by sba does not even begin to provide adequate compensation to assist the residents of the love creek area in replacing the properties which they have lost because of the disaster in addition the interest rates tied to the sba loans range from 8 percent to 16 percent many of the residents of this area are elderly persons and are living on fixed incomes to require these persons to pay such high rates of interest would simply make these loans unaffordable for them the fact is that these residents have invested their lives and their hard labor in these homes and to be forced to demolish their residences which have been directly destablized by the disaster is the ultimate disaster for these families i think it is clear that the disaster assistance offered to these families in this instance has fallen far short of aiding them to replace their lost property at another location the very purpose of disaster assistance is to try to give families the opportunity to repair their damage and become whole again that will not happen in love creek today therefore i am introducing legislation to provide a direct grant to residents of love creek to assist in the purchase of another residence under this legislation residents would become eligible for additional assistance that when combined with other disaster aid will not exceed 75 percent of the value of their home in love creek i think the extraordinary circumstances which exist in love creek merit extraordinary assistance being offered to these residents this is not just a ase of repairing the damages from a storm this is the tragedy of telling families to destroy homes untarnished by the storm itself the legislation i am introducing is confined solely to the unique disaster of 29 residents that have been affected in the love creek area it was my hope that some existing program would be able to provide measurable assistance to these residents and not require the legislation that i am introducing today after extensive review of all federal disaster assistance programs however there is no such relief potentially available the unique situation facing these residents is clear it is only appropriate that we try to fulfill the same promise to these families that we make to others damaged by such stormsthat they be given a chance to survivea chance to continue their lives in another home surely a nation that has bestowed its great charity on the afflicted of other nations will not deny that same charity to its own love creek is a test of the depth of our concern for our fellow man following is the text of this legislation

colleagues they did not invest it in american proin the house of representatives that ductivity because the administrations economic program has so depressed economic activity and economic prospects that we now have tremendous amounts of excess idle capacity in our factories and the threats of new waves of bankruptcies among our businesses the people of the united states now want their chance at a meaningful tax relief package a vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that chance under the congressional black caucus proposal your middle income constituents will fare far better in tax relief than under the kemprothreagan second and third year tax measures under our tax proposal the 96 percent of the people of this country who make 50 000 a year or less will have much more money in their pockets and in their pocketbooks gone in our proposal are last years windfall profits tax exemptions of 1 billion gone are the tax loopholes that gave excessive benefits to oil companies and to people who invested only in chinese and antiques and gold coins those features of the fauntroy substitute measured alone save us 10 billion in deficit spending a vote for the congressional black caucus is a vote to reduce taxes for 96 percent of the people of this country this is the peoples house and we ask you to give them a chance to receive what they want and what they need meaningful real tax relief the people of this country want relief from the enormous budget deficit that has resulted from last years tax giveaway to the rich and the gigantic increase in military spending of last year the people o this country now know that those large deficits mean continued high interest rates and thus continued small business and small farmer failures and continued high unemployment at record levels such as we have achieved in this past year the people of this countryand remember this is the peoples housewant a strong national defense but they do not want domination of the world they want an end to nuclear proliferation and your vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that they know with former secretary of the defense ielvin laird thatand i quote him our true strategic military needs have little to do with military weapons except to deter their use against us he points out that we must be able to keep open the sea and air links that bind us to our allies and that we need to be able to hold ground on the borders of europe and elsewhere and to protect and sustain power at great distance none of these objectives as i continue to quote former secretary of defense melvin laird none of these objectives requires nuclear weapons your vote for the fauntroy substitute will acknowledge that fact ii12689 the caucus budget also anwers a number of concerns raised by amendments offered for consideration under the rule today for those of you who have offered amendments to raise the cola caps in the jones budget for federal employees and retirees and to all of my colleagues who intend to support those amendments i say that a vote for the caucus amendment does just what you want the fauntroy substitute does not require such amendments since it incorporates the cbo baseline levels which preserve current service costofliving adjustments for federal pay and pensions a number of members have offered amendments to increase funding for function 500 education above the level recommended by the house budget committee the fauntroy substitute also as proposed raises funding for education above the house budget committee level and indeed it includes funding to restore programs to the present fiscal year 1982 reductions as passed in grammlatta let me now briefly outline the details of the congressional black caucus substitute before concluding my remarks you first ought to understand that the cbc budget reduces the deficit substantially in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that our budget will produce a 92 8 billion deficit in fiscal year 1983 which is lower by at least 10 billion than the deficit estimated by cbo for any other substitute and half the 183 billion deficit that will exist if nothing is done to rectify the errors of last years budget moreover our budget will lead to steadily shrinking deficits of 60 billion in fiscal year 1984 and a 18 billion surplus in fiscal year 1985 bringing interest rates down and providing the basis for genuine economic recovery in our country second you ought to know that the fauntroy substitute is fair and humane we not only prevent that many additional cuts in human needs programs as proposed by the president we return funds to social programs that were lost by the enactment of the reagan fiscal year 1982 budget reductions these programs must remain federal priorities if we value human potential and care to meet human needs because of savings generated by our alternative tax and defense policies several education health housing and urban programs can be restored to fiscal year 1981 funding levels adjusted for inflation for example the fauntroy substitute adds 3 3 billion to title i 600 million to pell grants for disadvantaged college students increasing funding for health care programs it adds 600 million in social services funding including child welfare programs and 1 billion more tlan reagan for pollution control it retains eda and the legal services corporation and lowincome energy and other conservation programs the third thing that this budget does is that it stimulates and creates jobs a centerpiece of our budget proposal is the creation of a major 6 billion to 8 billion federal jobs vocational education and training package this is a response to both the nations unemployment rate generally and to the catastrophic unempioyment in the black community specifically the fauntroy substitute also includes a 4 billion urban infrastructure proposal which will create 50 000 to 80 000 jobs directly and more indirectly a 4 billion expansion in mass transit and highway construction programs which will create an equal number of jobs in this country it also includes home ownership assistance and rental housing construction programs that will stimulate employment in residential construction finally the budget insures adequate social security and other support for the nations poor both the elderly and the nonelderly this budget maintains the costofliving adjustment for elderly on fixed incomes and expands unemployment compensation benefits at a time when we have 10 3 million people out of work the program triggers in the caucus budget increase eligibility for the unemployed to 52 weeks in our view this restoration of benefits is necessary at a time when we are experiencing the levels of unemployment which have not been endured since the depression our budget also provides increased funding for other programs to assist the poor including 3 2 billion more than reagan for aid to families with dependent children 5 billion more for food stamps 3 billion more for medicaid and medicare 1 2 billion more for six health programs and 400 million more for supplemental social insurance as my colleagues in the congressional black caucus follow me they will give you more details about the caucus budget resolution i simply want to remind you again that this is the peoples house and we ought to give the people the life support programs that will cushion them through these difficult times we need to give 96 percent of the people of this country the kird of tax relief that we have pr45mised in the generalized language about tax relief for all of the people we need to give the people relief from the enormous deficits and the high interest rates that have robbed the people of this country of homes and farms small businesses and 2 5 million jobs just since july of last year a vote for the fauntroy substitute the economic recovery program of the congressional black caucus will do just that at this time i would like to add the congressional budget offices reestimate of our budget proposal and yield time to my distinguished colleague from new york the third ranking member of the ways and means committee to share with you what our proposal does with respect to tax relief for the american people"], [7.3909759521484375e-06, 0.5000073909759521, 0, "i rise in strong

objectives should be the associations industrial objectives panel comprised of 26 outstanding business labor and academic leaders chose not to focus on economic planning or identifying sunset and sunrise industries since similar efforts have ended in conflict and frustration in the past instead the panel identified basic longterm industrial objectives from these they derived intermediate goals which in turn clarified appropriate shortterm policies finally the panel examined government policies which it considered useful and needed the panel was particularly interested in determining whether it is possible within our system of government to devise machinery or procedures for considering objections for economic activity without endangering decentralized competition a fundamental tenet of our economic system the five industrial objectives which the panel identified are first strengthening unitedstates competitiveness at home and abroad second insuring national and economic security third achieving general price stability fourth promoting full employment and fifth enhancing the quality of life the four intermediate goals which link these objectives with specific policy recommendations are first improving productivity second controlling inflation third establishing adjustment mechanisms and fourth encouraging the wise tise f limited resources the panel recommended the following set of principles as guidelines for the development and implementation of a system of american industrial objectives first the overriding industrisl objective is to insure a strong economic base that will contribute to the quality of life of americans and will promote a higher standard of living second when formulating broad economic goals and setting priorities the executive office and congress should give greater emphasis to the need for policies that will encourage the systematic rejuvenation of unitedstates industry and will help to maintain an economic base critical to a strong economy and to national security third government policies should promote a longterm stable economic environment assuring maximum employment and a climate favorable to industrial growth fourth sectoral and functional policies are essential to the attainment of industrial objectives micro policies should be devised that are consistent with macro goals but government should not attempt to identify winner of loser industries fifth through incentives and disincentives government policies geared toward industry will inevitably shift the allocation of resources within and among sectors insofar as practical such policies should be designed so that they stimulate productive investment rather than encouraging nonproductive uses of resources sixth governmental policies geared to the industrial sector will also shift the allocation of resources between or among income groups but insofar as possible they should be designed so that they do not result in a less equitable distribution of wealth or income seventh there should be a general governmental review of policies regulating the activities of unitedstates industry in order to make them more coherent and consistent with one another and with the objectives outlined in this statement eighth human resources policies should focus on creating a highly trainable pool of entrants into the labor force and also on training the currently unemployed a serious effort should be made at the high school level to insure that graduates are equipped with the basic learning skills that will enable them to absorb specific job skill training in addition technical studies should be encouraged at the postsecondary school level finally specific job skill training programs should be expanded so that they promote labors efficiency and mobility ninth in formulating a competition policy policymakers should focus on both the international and the domestic dimensions of competition policies that insure that unitedstates firms are competitive in domestic marketsnot only with each other but with foreign firms located or selling in the united stateswill do much to advance the international competitiveness of american firms tenth an active and highly competent trade office which strongly represents the interests of the united states in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and in other international organizations which keeps exporters abreast of opportunities in international markets and which exerts its influence to keep international markets open should be maintained trade policies geared toward unitedstates industrial objectives should not encourage beggarthyneighbor policies but should counteract the adverse effects of the industrial policies of foreign governments on u s industry eleventh policies related to industrial objectives should be designed in such a way that both savings and investment are encouraged while savings are of limited economic value if they do not result in more investment investment itself will be limited if savings do not increase twelfth advisory committees composed of government officials working in concert with labor business and public leaders would contribute to the efficacy of the policymaking process by integrating the objectives of each sector into the overall assessment of policy such committees would serve as a valuable information network and would significantly contribute to the consensusbuilding process that is crucial to the establishment of industrial objectives mit economist lester thurow has said that our economy is suffering from a

gratified to recognize that legislation i have introduced responds to a great many of the recommendations of the panel my bill the productivity incentive act of 1982 is designed to encourage productivity full employment longterm savings and price stability it accomplishes these objectives by encouraging em ployers and employees to adopt a twotier wage structure a base wage and a periodic bonus based on corporate profits or cost savings such a wage structure which predominates in japan gives workers a stake in the companys performance and thus a reason to look for ways to increase productivity and profits it also gives the company a way to avoid laying workers off during adverse business conditions and a way to reduce wage inflation one of the most persistent problems facing

next 21 days members of the congressional class will address the house on the individual longterm refusenik they have adopted in january i traveled to the soviet union the 9 days i spent in moscow and leningrad have left a deep and lasting impression on me one can never actually imagine the extreme hardships that the refusenik families face on a daily basis in their attempt to achieve religious freedom in the united states religious freedom is accepted as a way of life but in the soviet union religious freedom is a constant struggle i returned home from my trip with a deeper commitment to human rights in general and a deeper commitment for securing the human right to emigrate from the soviet union i have come home with a greater appreciation of our own fundamental freedoms and liberties as a nation of immigrants i am proud that the united states is the leader in promoting global emigration rights and in providing basic human freedoms today emigration remains restricted for all citizens of the soviet union soviet authorities speak of the reunification of families usually meaning families torn apart by world war ii and the postwar period thus effectively avoiding the term emigration by using the grounds that they seek to be united with their relatives usually in israel some jews have been permitted to emigrate since the late 1960s unfortunately this represents only a small fraction of the number of jews who have the desire and the dream of finding religious freedom in their lifetime several reasons are cited as to why soviet jews want to emigrate including the need for religious freedom to escape the growing discrimination and antisemitism that they face in the soviet union or the need to go to israel to work as jews to strengthen the state yet for hundreds of thousands of jews the decision to apply for exit visas is not an easy one many jews wait as long as a decade or longer before they are granted permission to emigrate almost all of them lose their jobs leaving them without any visible means to support themselves or their families they are almost always the constant target of harassment by their community by the kgb and by other soviet officials in addition to the legal requirement that soviet jews be invited to emigrate to israel by a close relative living in that country the soviet authorities have made their own government bureaucracy increasingly difficult to deal with they monitor the mail and confiscate or delay the delivery of such invitations they place numerous restrictions on the issue of visa applications which make the entire process increasingly difficult the government will not accept applications in cases where part of the family does not wish to emigrate or cannot this is a catch22 situation in the soviet union families are large and an immediate family can constitute three complete generations if the soviet government refuses emigration for one family member the chances for the remainder of the family to leave may be nil allow me to point out that such persecution of jews in the soviet union is in direct violation of the commitments to freedom of thought conscience expression or religion and emigration made by the soviet union through its adoption of and or participation as a signatory to the united nations international covenant on civil and political rights the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe at helsinki the united nations charter and the universal declaration on human rights additionally such persecution is in violation of the soviets own constitution the ban on the study and teaching of hebrew a basic and fundamental desire of many soviet jews complete ly lacks legality in article 27 of the helsinki final act it states in those states in which ethnic religious or linguistic minorities exist persons be longing to such minorities shall not be denied the right in community with other members of their group to enjoy their own culture to profess their own religion or to use their own language article 36 of the 1977 constitution of the russian republic guarantees the possibilities to use their native language and the provision of facilities for selfeducation additionally the official communist party program as reprinted in pravda on march 17 1972 states that any citizen can learn and teach a language he prefers in some way this was admitted by the government organ izvestia when on december 24 1976 in an authoritative article entitled the indbstructible power of the soviet culture declared that no one in the soviet union is forbidden to study any language including hebrew or yiddish this statement apparently serves as official confirmation that the soviet government is aware that the hebrew language is closely tied to jewish culture in his article international law and the right to study hebrew in the ussr dr william korey the director of international policy research at bnai brith international states clearly the right of a national minority to maintain and extend its cultural heritage through mean of teaching that involves the use of the minoritys language is at the heart of the modern civilized society and is accorded fundamental recognition in international law collectively the plight of the refuseniks is a tragic indictment of off icial soviet policy by denying soviet citizens specifically jews the right to emigrate the soviets are violating several international legal standards which they say that they have accepted only a few short months ago in small simple apartments like that of dr aleksander lerner a refusenik since 1972 i persohally witnessed the hardships and alienations suffered by those whose only crime was and is a desire to be free i heard the father of three young children describe the horrnr of being interrogated by the kge i watched with compassion as the mother of anatoly shcharansky the refusenik who was sentenced to 13 years in prison on a trumpedup charge of treason tearfully asked us to increase the public outcry on behalf of her son the refuseniks were eager for us to know the reality of their situation they were eager for us to take their cause to the free world they know as we do that recognition of their right to emigrateeven if only partially securedwill be won only if those in the west make it a priority issue we must show the soviet union that we in the united states care that we remember these refusenik families and that we shall never forget the hardships and the fears that these people face on a daytoday basis we must demonstrate to them that the unitedstates government ranks human rights as a top priority issue and make them realize and appreciate the fact that on this particular issue we shall not budge they must know that in the united states the basic issue of human rights is not a partisan one that no matter what party controls the white house the senate or the house we as free americans will not be satisfied until all of those who wish to be free are free we as americans enjoy religious freedom as a way of life whereas soviet jews must request religious freedom and such requests cause them nothing but oppression by the hands of the soviet government as members of the 97th congressional class for soviet jewry we have devoted ourselves to the sponsorship of oppressed soviet jewish families i have sponsored yuli kosharovsky yuli kosharovsky is one of the leading and most wellknown figures in the large jewish community in the soviet union as a teacher of hebrew and jewish culture in moscow he has been the constant target of harassment by the kgb and other soviet officials yull is one of the most remarkable men i have ever had the opportunity to meet he is devoted to his wife and children his community and his religion he is devoted to the basic fundamental principles of freedom of thought conscience religions and emigration that he believes he is entitled to as a human being although he lives in constant fear yull kosharovsky does not live afraid the terror of kgb interrogations have become an accepted norm in his lifestyle he has learned to live with their harassment yull kosharovsky is a brave courageous man who has fought the soviet government for over a decade in his attempt to gain emigration to israel for himself and his family where he can practice the faith of his choice freely and without fear or harassment but fighting the soviet government is not an easy thing to do when you are a jew in moscow since yuli first applied for emigration in april of 1971 he has not had an easy time soon after applying for his exit visa yuli began to experience a series of problems which unfortunately continue through today he lost his job as a radio electronics engineer and has been forced to take on odd jobs to support his family yet yuli remains proud and he will not accept charity from his friends both in the soviet union and abroad and his struggle continues on occasion he has been placed under house arrest spent time in jail on trumpedup charges and taken away from his family without being given any type of explanation over the past 11 years yuli has had his home searched on many occasions and such searches have increased rapidly over the past months he has had his books and religious materials confiscated and his family suffer through harassment because of his stature within the refusenik community i am concerned that yull may become the next viktor brallovsky we must take action to prevent this from happening we must let the soviet government know that we know about yuli and that we care about him i am happy to say that the response in the house to the plights of yuli kosharovsky have been tremendous since congressman ed weber and i introduced house resolution 269 on november 12 1981 we have received over 60 cosponsors i am pleased to say that jim shannon who accompanied me to the soviet union and met yull with me joins me as a cosponsor of the resolution house resolution 269 passed this body on we in the unitedstates congress can help this fine man gain the freedom he deserves and desires so much yuli kosharovsky is not alone there are so many other refuseniks who want their basic freedom to practice their religion and you will hear about some of them during the next 21 days e"], [1.1801719665527344e-05, 0.5000118017196655, 0, "today june 22 1982 is the feast day of two great saintsst john fisher and st thomas more st john fisher was a bishop and during his imprisonment in the tower of london was elevated to the rank of cardinal he later was martyred for his refusal to acknowledge king henry viii as head of the church of england it is worth noting that most of the english clergy capitulated to the kings demand but among those who did not were two carthusian monks along with bishop fisher they were beheaded for their steadfastness our concern today however is with st thomas more the only layman among the four prisoners in the tower more was a lawyer scholar author diplomat kings counsellor and chancellor of england in addition he was in every sense of the term a devoted father andhusband born in 1477 or 1478 he had four children by his first wife jane colt and after her death in 1511 he married a widow alice middleton who brought into her new family her own daughter alice the stories of his warm family lifethe mutual devotion constantly displayed have been brilliantly set forth in robert bolts awardwinning dramatization a man for all seasons thomas more is one of the most human saints in the church the great scholar erasmus said he would make me dance the tightrope he was the personification of christian humanism in touch with all the discoveries of his age his interest in new ideas was profound he loved the arts as well as knowledge and historians tell us he turned his own house into a miniature platonic academy where sons daughters sonsinlaw friends and relations rivaled one another in the brilliance of their scholarship even before he became lord chancellor of england more was eminent throughout europe it is important for us to recall that the temptations of success did not make his reunification of high public office an easy thing to do unlike bishop john fisher of rochester more did not completely break with henry as soon as the kings breach with rome became final when the act of succession became the law of england more could not remain in office without compromising his honest belief that the marriage of henry and ann boleyn was illegal he therefore quietly resigned the chancellorship on the grounds of ill health and returned to his home and family but his enemies would not leave him in peace and his attempts to avoid swearing to the act of succession were unavailing his imprisonment for 15 months in the tower followed i have seen the cell in which he was confined it is a very small room whose cramped space was in contrast to the greatness and serenity of his heart his possessions were confiscated and his wife had to sell many personal belongings to pay for food not only did his wife and daughter margaret visit him in prison and plead with him to emulate so many other good men by submitting to the king but even cromwell himself it was easier to deny cromwell than it was to deny his loving but perplexed family on july 1 1535 in westminster hall he was condemned to death historians have no doubts about thomas more there were no intrigues or plots nor speculation about what he was really after or what ambition he was trying to fulfill following his conviction he rose to his feet and very calmly told the court of royal sycophants why he was going to his death in a stirring speech of heroic defiance more said the discharge of my conscience enforceth me to speak so much wherein i call and appeal to god whose only sight pierceth into the very depth of mans heart to be my witness the church is one and indivisible and you have no authority to make a law which infringes on christian unity the kings response to such words was the executioners ax the great significance of thomas mores martyrdom hilaire belloc tells us is that he acted in isolation not of course a total isolation for there were many martyrs who were similarly executed but these were clergy not worldly and successful as more and none leaving behind a bewildered and griefstricken family he laid his life down for one point of catholic doctrine only unsupported by the militant combative nature of the ideologue he was not one of those who delighted in such a challenge worse his cause enjoyed no sympathy from those nearest to him he suffered from selfdoubts but in spite of all this he offered himself as a victim being human he shared our common capacity for rationalizing the very force that would tell us were we in the tower that by yielding we were doing the right thing mores good humor and commonsense made him aware of how ridiculous he looked in such an isolated position he endured the public charges of eccentricity and the private chastisements of his wife that he was perverse foolish and uncaring for his family the most terrible aspect of this martyrs isolation was his inability to see any good whatsoever coming from his sacrifice he was absolutely alone he had nothing within or without nothing promised in the future nothing inherited from the past nothing in the tradition of his habits and life to nerve him for what he did and yet he did it it was on july 6 1535 that sir thomas more was led out to execution on tower hill some were shocked at his cheerfulnessto them most unbecoming he is said to have asked for assistance in climbing the scaffold stating that he could make it down by himselfhe admonished his executioner to be most careful of his flowing beard for it hath committed no treason the king had given orders that more was to be denied the right to make the customary speech on the scaffold and thus forced sir thomas to utter but one sentencea sentence that was to become immortal i die the kings good servant but gods first his conscience his integrity were intact and have served as a shining symbol of what sublime heights the soul of mere mortal man is capable of attaining on thursday evening september 16 1982 chief justice of the united states warren e burger will be awarded the first honorary membership in the thomas more society of america the award will be presented at the societys annual banquet to be held at the sheraton washington hotel in washington d c following a reception at 6 30 at the banquet the chief justice will make a major address linking issues faced by thomas more 450 years ago as henry viiis chancellor with issues which arose in the early development of the unitedstates constitution i suppose the great lessons to be taught by the life of thomas more are that indeed a person may be in and of this world this society and yet remain saintly he teaches us by his heroic example that there are matters of principle of conscience that are worth dying for this must come as a stunning revelation to so many who view death as the ultimate evil not so thomas more who believed violating his conscience was the ultimate evilthe loss of his immortal soul we need not feel as solitary as more must have felt when he resisted the pleadings of so many to simply sign the oath of supremacy we can feel a special kinship with this rare singular man that we are bound with the dead the living and the not yet born in a purposeful order an order that imposes much duty and grants much opportunity what is demanded of us too is heroic faith not in a single act of sublime martyrdom but cumulatively in the numberless trials of living each day in a sinful world t s eliot wrote of an earlier st thomas thomas a beckett whose murder in a cathedral provides so many parallels to mores martyrdom that i should like to repeat the final prayer of eliots great chorus for each of us here today we thank thee for the mercies of blood for thy redemption by blood for the blood of thy martyrs and saints shall enrich the earth shall create the holy places for wherever a saint has dwelt wherever a martyr has given his blood for the blood of christ there is holy ground and the sanctity shall not depart from it though armies trample over it though sightseers come with guide books

offered today such amendments no matter what form they take will not work the fiscal magic claimed by their supporters the unitedstates constitution is the fundamental document of this republic it lays out the rights and freedoms of the people and defines the parameters and responsibilities of the three branches of government this fundamental structure of our government was carefully crafted by our founding fathers our constitution is not a document that should dictate any one economic theory or policy it is not a document to be shaped by economic theories currently in vogue the amendments to balance the federal budget would alter the fundamental nature of this governments structure the current language of the constitution states that congress has the power to lay and collect taxes duties imports and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states thus under the constitution it is the conress a body of duly elected individuals which makes the decisions on how to operate the federal government if a balanced budget amendment were adopted this fundamental responsibility of congress would be abrogated the federal courts composed of judges appointed for life would be drawn into the budget process federal judges would make decisions controlling the tax system and could dictate the manner in which outlays were distributed among budgetary items vying for funding furthermore a constitutional link would be established between the conduct of foreign policy and the constraints of economic policy except in times of war the president would be restricted in his foreign policy decisions by the amendments requirement that the federal budget be in balance every year the congress would not be able to vote for foreign aid in response to a presidential request and thus our foreign policy would be severely handicapped our national security interests compromised under the terms of these amendments one congress will be allowed to bind successive congresses to certain economic policiesthis kind of bondage is something the original framers of the constitution would certainly have disagreed with under the constitution the congress is given the rightto make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all othef powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any other department or officer thereof thus any balanced budget amendment would detract from the right of congress to set its own rules for budgeting in each fiscal year under a balanced budget amendment current economic realities would force our government to adhere to a cash and carry policy which no one in this modern day world practices the argument that individuals only purchase what they can afford ignores the longterm debt that most individuals carry in order to make big purchases such as a home or a car the federal government too must make those types of expenditures for longterm capital investments how ese could we maintain our highways aad pay for sophisticated weapons systems of course the congress could simply drop the unified budget system and adopt the capital accounting procedure used by many states in fiscal year 1983 we would have a budget sur plus of 25 billion if the capital accounting procedure were used adoption of the balanced budget amendment would make conformance to this particular accounting system almost irresistable the balanced budget amendment uses words such as outlays receipts debts and national income adoption of either balanced budget amendment offered today would require the congress to adopt implementing legislation defining exactly what these terms mean there is however no consensus among economic experts on the specific definitions of these terms the terms are useful as general concepts to explain economic behavior but are impossible to reduce to specific definitions of certain actions and activities in the economy adoption of either balanced budget amendment would have a profound affect upon the relationship between the federal government and the states there would be a shift in debt burdens from the federal government to the states in those states that have adopted balanced budget amendments an associated press survey found that 18 states have either cut spending and or raised taxes or simply settled for deficits 20 states have raised taxes and 20 states have laid off state workers given this record of experience with balanced budget amendments the federal government should not be quite so eager tc bind itselt to one peculiar economic theory had a balanced budget amendment been part of the constitution this year the loss to the states in most cases would average over 200 a person in order to maintain the level of services in these states all state taxes would have to be raised by an average of 37 5 percent in 1982 and again by 38 6 percent in 1983 even if the supporters of a balanced budget amendment believe that the federal government has no business redistributing the income of this nation they cannot believe that the federal laws promoting uniformity for the protection of the environment and the health and education of its citizenry should be abolished for example many federal laws set out minimum standards to promote clean air or clean water or special education for certain groups of the populationgroups such as the handicapped or disadvantaged adults and children without the monetary incentive to set up these programs to protect the environment to promote the health and education of the people most states would just not agree to be bound by a uniform federal law we would all lose if uniform laws were no longer ap plied in a majority of states there would be a proliferation of disparate laws regulating the environment and affecting business and individuals i favor a balanced budget but the budget will only be balanced by making the daily decisions to cut back on government programs those decisons are difficult to make during the past 2 years this congress has made those tough decisions the congress has responded to constituent concern about the increases in federal spending the system is working clearly there is a continuing need to refine the budget process and be alert to excess expenditure waste

deployment of new strategic weapons for the last decade during this same period of time the soviets used dotente as a cover for an enormous buildup of conventional and nuclear military might in the last 10 years the soviets developed and deployed systems which now threaten our very survival certainly a number of factors have given rise to the nuclear freeze movement fear of a nuclear holocaust has been a major motivation for freeze advocates the strange quandary is that if the soviet union were not what it isan expansionist military powerthe world would not fear a nuclear holocaust no such fear existed when the united states had a monopoly on nuclear weapons or clear superiority in every major international confrontation from berlin in the 1960s through the 1973 middle east war our nuclear superiority helped restrain soviet aggression today military analysts are not speaking of american nuolear superiority rather they are expounding on soviet superiority a comparison of the events connected with the cuban missile crisis with those of afghanistan and poland leaves no doubt that a great power shift has taken place why oppose a nuclear freeze at this time president reagan has warned of the danger of america being locked into a position of nuclear inferiority what is he talking about in the european theater he is referring to the soviet monopoly on medium range missiles in the mid1970s the soviets began deploying the triple warhead ss20s to date they have deployed 315 mobile ss20s in addition to 280 singlewarhead ss4 and ss5 missiles for a total of more than 1 200 warheads not counting refires nato has no comparable systems deployed with regard to strategic systems the soviets are now able to threaten the unitedstates nuclear force with a first strike capability the soviets surpassed our nato force in total destructive power in their strategic systems in the late 1960s and in the number of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles in 1973 the resulting imbalance in icmbs is frightening for instance in order to assure a high probability of destroying a hardened icbm silo two highyield and highaccuracy warheads must be used only the unitedstates minuteman iii and the soviet s18 and ss19 icbms carry warheads which are capable of doing this the united states currently has about 1 650 warheads deployed on minuteman iiis whereas the unitedstatess r has over 4 000 warheads deployed on ss18s and ss19s the soviet 4 000 are more than enough to take out our landbased missile silos in fact the soviets may well be able to destroy our icbms with the ss18 alone our aged bomber force is likewise in jeopardy as are our submarines in port our subs at sea will become increasingly vulnerable to soviet detection and attack in future years i ask you is this the position the united states should be locked into obviously the answer is no a freeze would not only prohibit the upgrading of delivery systems it would also leave us with weapons that are inadequate and unreliable we produced our last strategic bomber warhead over 13 years ago since that time we have been relying on the b28 and b43 warheads which are dangerous to transport in several plane crashes in greenland and spain the warheads have dispersed radioactive material which the united states cleaned up at considerable expense the resulting international protests helped to confine our bomber force to the ground where it now lies vulnerable to a soviet slbm attack the freeze would prohibit the deployment of the b83 replacement warhead and the w80 cruise missile both of which will be made with new high explosives that are far less sensitive to shock and highvelocity impact than the conventional high explosives used in our current stockpile this new explosive combined with other new fireresistant features makes virtually impossible the dispersal of plutonium as a result of an aircraft accident these improvements will contribute in a very significant way to the overall survivability of the bomber force by allowing the air force to maintain the bombers at a maximum readiness posture and to dispatch the bombers in a crisis situation without the fear that an accident might result in plutonium dispersal a ugus t 5 1982 in fact many of the proposed strategic modernization plans like the deployment of the trident d5 missile and replacement of the titan icbms are not additions to the arms race but needed modifications that will vastly improve the flexibility survivability and safety of unitedstates strategic forces very little attention has been given to the age and the physical differences that exist between united states and soviet nuclear warheads about twothirds of the soviet warheads are estimated to be less than 10 years old while at least half of the unitedstates strategic warheads are between 15 and 20 years old a few are even older in addition as soviet warheads are more physically robust than ours the situation is somewhat analogous to the longterni durability of a mack truck as compared with a lightweight highperformance sports car the zablocki resolution would prohibit testing of nuclear warheads thus should the freeze be adopted as policy we would be unable to maintain and certify the performance of nuclear warheads currently on hand as our strategic stockpile continues to age the international perception of what the two sides can accomplish will begin to favor the soviets even more what would the impact of a freeze be on arms negotiations and other vital defense issues it is reasonable to assume that if we agree to accept the present arms imbalance as status quo the soviets will not seriously negotiate to reduce nuclear arms advantages which they see as necessary to advancing their geopolitical objectives in addition a united statessoviet freeze may well encourage international nuclear proliferation as our allies perceive that the united states has accepted an inferior position and thus may not be able to provide an adequate protective nuclear umbrella will a freeze mean less defense spending not when you consider that a freeze will force an increased reliance on conventional arms for deterrence which are the bigticket items in the defense budget the latest soviet defense outlay reports confirm that there will be no slackening of soviet defense spending in the foreseeable future according to nato officials after adjusting for inflation soviet defense spending will continue to rise at an average yearly rate of 4 percent this means that the soviets plan to spend on defense at least 15 percent of their gross domestic product by 1985 compared with 11 to 13 percent in the early 1970s in 1985 the united states will probably spend just 6 percent of our gnp on national security even with the reagan defense plan proponents of the freeze should be prepared to increase defense spending for conventional forces substantially as a result of what they are advocating here today in short a nuclear freeze at todays levels of nuclear arms would not enhance our deterrent it would not enhance our freedom or make the world a safer place to live in a nuclear freeze would put a stamp of approval on the soviet arms buildup and soviet expansionism and international aggression it would also make arms reductions almost impossible to achieve"]]}
