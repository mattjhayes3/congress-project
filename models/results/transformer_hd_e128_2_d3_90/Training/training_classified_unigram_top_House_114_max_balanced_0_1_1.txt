for global climate change and that is not a good thing according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 was our planets hottest year on record last year the global average land surface temperature was 1 33 celsius above the 20th century average and 10 of the last 12 months tied or broke existing records for highest monthly global temperatures despite the fact that climate science and research consistently display the reality of climate change some of my colleagues still debate its validity in this very chamber what is there to debate more than 12 000 peerreviewed scientific studies are in agreement that climate change is real and humans are significantly to blame for those of you keeping track at home there are zero peerreviewed scientific studies that state the opposite one of the primary concerns of these scientific studies is that climate change might trigger events that will dramatically alter the earth as we know it scientists have discovered a number of tipping points where abrupt changes in climate could create a variety of national and global effects it is hard to predict when these events could occur but we know that when they do we will have very little warning reaching these critical points could lead to abrupt changes in the ocean snow cover permafrost and the earths biosphere alarmingly many of these events are triggered by warming levels of less than 2 degrees we now know that in the latter part of this century we will find the planets temperature pushing not 2 degrees but 4 5 even 6 degrees celsius of warming while it may seem minor each degree makes a significant difference a 2degree shift in temperatures could lead to an increased rise in sea level by 55 centimeters levels have already risen by about 20 centimeters over the course of the 20th century increasing flooding along coastlines impacting people and properties a 3degree increase could impact water availability and accelerate drought and extreme heat waves each of these conditions would negatively impact the production of major crops like wheat and rice leading to global food security risks anything above a 4degree increase would cause even more drastic consequences such as extreme ocean acidification a decline in glaciers a change in ocean currents and a nearly icefree arctic in the summer while the majority of the detected shifts are distant from major population centers the implications will be felt over large distances creating significant economic and humanitarian consequences as with any abrupt change in the earths system a cascade of other transformations will likely follow each building upon and exacerbating the others we could see a shift in ecosystems the collapse of permafrost in the arctic and an extensive species loss each of these changes would trigger massive implications for the natural systems and society as a whole so what does all this mean it means we must act now as president obama said in his state of the union address if you want to debate the science of climate change feel free to do so but you will be pretty lonely today americas business leaders the pentagon the majority of americans the scientific community and nations around the world recognize that we cannot wait to act we saw evidence of this last year when more than 40 000 negotiators from 196 countries descended on the french capital for the paris climate summit the summit provided the world with an effective global framework for addressing climate change but our work is far from over it is time to recognize that the consequences of inaction are far too great if my colleagues are willing to put political ideologies aside and recognize that acting on climate change is not just in our planets interest but in the interest of humanity we may still have a fighting chance albert einstein once said the world as we have created it is a process of our thinking it cannot be changed without changing our thinking now

you we would not have passed this resolution in 2006 we went on to pass it in 2007 and it passed in the house with a vote of 4100 in 2008 it passed in the house of representatives by 4030 in 2009 by 4240 in 2010 by 4210 in 2010 of course and thereafter we stopped passing resolutions on the floor of the house although we may still present them and talk about them on the floor of the house so tonight this is what we will do i would like to mention the mission of the naacp which is to ensure the political educational social and economic equality of all personsnot just of black people not just of people of color but of all people the naacp also desires to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination these are lofty and noble goals because we understand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial discrimination in this country and the naacp took it upon itself to eliminate as much of it as possible it has done a good job i might add lets look at a little bit of the history of the naacp back on february 12 1909 a group of people decided that it was going to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in this country literally in this country between 1889 and 1918 thousands of african americans were lynchedthousands lynching was done with mob violence people were taken to trees and they were lynched it was done a good many times with impunity no one was ever prosecuted it was a grave injustice and there were people in this country who decided that they were going to do something about this injustice among the people who met initially were mary white ovington oswald garrison villard william english walling and ida wellsbarnett these persons met and issued a clarion call some 60 persons answered that call hence the naacp was born the naacp did not have its first african american as an executive secretary until 1920 it is important for us to note that many of the founders of the naacpin fact most of themwere not of african ancestry the first executive secretaries of the organization were all persons who were of european ancestry in fact the first five executive secretaries were white they were not black in 1934 the naacp had its first black board chairpersonlouis t wright dr wright became chairperson after the naacp had had a good number of white chairpersons so the naacp has never been and is not now an organization for blacks only the naacp has always stood for an integrated society and has been an integrated organization since its inception in 1954 the naacp under the leadership and counsel of the honorable thurgood marshall who became a justice of the supreme court won the lawsuit of brown v board of education this was a giant leap forward for us because this lawsuit integrated to a certain extent schools throughout the country the word that was appropriately used at the time was desegregated these schools were ordered to be desegregated with all deliberate speed and all deliberate speed can sometimes take a lot longer than one might expect a good many years later there are still those who would contend that we have not fully integrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the country in 1955 an naacp member the honorable rosa parks an african american lady decided that she was going to take a stand and she took that stand by taking a seat she took a seat on a bus in so doing she ignited a spark that started a civil rights movement by the way there are many people who contend that she did this because she was tired well she may have been tired but she did it because she wanted to take a stand she was tired of societys relegating her to the back of the bus and she took a stand against it hence we had the montgomery bus boycott which lasted more than a year at the end of that boycott the bus linethe transportation systemwas integrated in alabama and of course later on throughout the country an interesting note on this point about the integration and desegregation of bus lines there was a threejudge panel that actually heard the litigation associated with this transportation issue on that threejudge panel there were judges who had a great debate about this but there was one frank m johnson a federal district court judge who took the position that we could apply the brown decision to public transportation this was the very first time it was done was under the leadership of that threejudge panel and by the honorable frank m johnson again i point these things out because it is important to note that there were others who were there with the naacp to help us along the way frank m johnson by the way was a republican appointee who was appointed by president eisenhower and he went on to help us to integrate schools throughout the south and integrate the department of public safety he went on to help us with the facilitation of voting rights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons from discriminating against persons in workplace environments he really played a significant role as did many other persons who were associated with the naacp in a vicarious way because i dont have evidence of his having been a member i want to move forward if i may next to 2008 i move forward to 2008 because this is when the naacp supported the passage of the emmett till unsolved civil rights crime act of 2007 there are many unsolved cases in the history of this country with reference to things that happened to african americans the naacp pushed for and supported legislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the dastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing no harm to anyone the naacp has fought for this in 2009 the naacp celebrated its centennial anniversary and the theme at that time was bold dreams and big victories obviously a good theme because the naacp has won many big victories in 2012 the naacp supported the smart and safe campaign which brought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration in this country people who study these issues are well aware that in this country we have an overpopulation of persons who are incarcerated much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws much of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of one type of offense with drugs to receive a harsher penaltycocaine for example then if you have crack cocaine you will get a stiffer penalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine the point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many people to be incarcerated who quite frankly should not be incarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated some of these three strikes and you are out laws have also caused persons to go to prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third offense so the naacp is fighting against this"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "to address that in committee i bring that up specifically because i know

aggregation of information is not enough to allow defendants and state court parties and sister asbestos trusts to make meaningful inquiry into whether or not they are being defrauded the amendment also removes the requirement that the asbestos trusts respond to information requests from parties subject to asbestosrelated suits and imposes the cost of such requests on the inquiring parties the costshifting element of this provision is significant in fact a gao report found that one asbestos trust had to pay over 1 million to respond to a discovery request rather than have asbestos trust money used to comply with discovery requests they should be preserved for the payment to the victims of asbestosrelated illnesses this amendment not only guts the transparency requirements and elements of the bill it also removes meaningful costsaving measures in fact the bill is carefully crafted to protect folks privacy here is what happens the legislation ensures that claimants

protection for filings made with the court would also apply to these public reports the rule would allow the courts to require redactions of personal and private information finally rule 9037 will allow the courts to limit or prohibit electronic access to the trust reports courts throughout the country already use these rules to protect the personal information of individuals who file claims during asbestos bankruptcies for example the court in overseeing a garlock bankruptcy redacted trust claims information that was introduced into a hearing record and later released to the public other courts have required anyone reviewing bankruptcy claims to agree to strict protective ordinances witnesses at the house committee on the judiciary on the fact act have explained that the bill does not

their work on this bipartisan legislation and ensuring a swift congressional response to the ongoing water crisis in flint michigan what have we learned and what will we do both now and into the future is the question what happened in flint is not a natural disaster it is a human disaster and a failure of government at every level in my questioning at last weeks oversight and government reform committee hearing it became very clear that individuals with the epa knew about the high lead levels in the drinking water for months but failed to communicate this information to the people of flint even under repeated freedom of information act requests the bill we are considering today takes important steps to strengthen federal requirements on the epa to notify the public when concentrations of lead in drinking water are above federal requirements i am glad the entire michigan delegation is backing this bill and i am committed to continuing to work together to get answers and help the families in flint who need clean water and for that matter learning from this for the families in the entire united states to make sure that this doesnt happen to them as well in america in the 21st century children should not have to worry about safe and clean drinking water the flint water crisis never should have happened and we must take action to ensure it never happens again making things right must be a cooperative effort at every level and this bill takes important steps to ensure proper coordination going forward i offer all of my support all of my assistance all of my help and my votes to make sure this happens"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "i thank the chairman for affording me the opportunity to address such a critical issue this reform package will protect taxpayer dollars while reforming some of the most egregious portions of the affordable care act as a member of the house committee on education and the workforce i am proud to support language included in this bill that would repeal the harmful auto enrollment mandate of the aca this provision which would apply to companies with 200 or more employees would otherwise move employees into a preapproved governmentmanaged health insurance plan creating more red tape and mandates was never the solution to curb rising healthcare costs and to increase access to insurance markets i was a freshman member in congress in 2009 when many of the individuals speaking today took part in a 24hourlong markup of an earlier version of the aca some of these provisions lacked all common sense and that holds true today half a decade later the department of labor is still struggling to find a way to enforce auto enrollment say what you want about the affordable care act this is plain unworkable repealing this provision will save 1 billion and maintain flexibility for employers in structuring health insurance benefits for their employees my democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle are just in denial since its passage the aca has been amended more than 50 times and the bulk of these were changes they supported and were signed into law by the president we should not stop there h r 3762 is the next great change to the aca and the american people deserve as much"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "i rise today in support of an amendment to increase funding for capital investment grants to help our nations mass transit rail systems the bill as is cuts 200 million from the account and my amendment would restore that funding while i recognize and as we have heard from the chairman and the ranking member there is not really a good spot to be able to take some of these additional funds from i do think it is important though that we talk about our infrastructure system especially our rail system and as we look specifically in the greater chicago area the chicago transit authoritys rail system the el serves around 725 000 riders each and every day and the metra which serves the suburban areas like the 10th district in illinois serves over 300 000 riders each and every day over a million people are using these rail systems again as we talked about before metra estimates that it needs to find roughly 13 4 billion over the next decade just to maintain the system in its current condition that is why it is more important than ever before to find the funds to pay to maintain and rebuild our nations transportation infrastructure system we hear all the time from our constituents that we need good highpaying jobs frankly a transportation infrastructure system for manufacturershow do we get raw material and a finished product out how do we get people around is absolutely critical to our economy i saw an estimate from ups that read that every additional 5 minutes of idling time costs them 100 million we have switches in the chicago area that delay rail up to 15 minutes one way that is 30 minutes a day and if you are a regular commuter that is 101 2 hours in a given month 1012 hours that you could be more productive or could be spending time with your family or spending time doing homework with your children if we as a country want to be more productive if we want to encourage more good highpaying jobs we have to find a way to make sure that we invest in our transportation infrastructure system when we use this transportation infrastructure system and if it goes away we are talking about an increase in congestionat least i can tell you in the chicago areaof an additional 50 percent in talking to the rail we would need an additional 29 lanes of traffic what is the cost of that we just dont have it if we dont have this type of funding the car in front of you could have been somebody who was sitting on the rail who could have been using mass transit this bill is a step backward for our nations mass transit systems not a step forward instead of providing funds to maintain and improve worldclass mass transit systems we are instead taking money away and making it harder and harder for the public to find the funds needed to keep their systems operational much less to improve them a reliable and consistent stream of capital funding is essential for these systems but this bill does not meet that need my amendment would take a step toward addressing that problem i recognize it is just a step but i am anxious to work with the chairman and the ranking member and i am anxious to work with those on the transportation and infrastructure committee to make sure that we are coming up with outsidethebox thinking in how we can improve our mass transit systems it is vitally important for our urban areas and it is certainly important for the nations transportation hub which i would argue is in the heartland in the chicago area i reserve the balance of my time"],

legislation and thank representative kildee and chairman upton for bringing this legislation forward our hearts go out to the people of flint who are enduring so much and persevering during this time it is heartwarming to see the way people across the country have come together in support of the people of flint the sad thing is that this situation could have been prevented and should have been prevented the legislation we are discussing today here in the house of representatives is because of failures in local state and federal government the fact is that the officials at the epa knew last april10 months agothat the flint utilities department was not using corrosion controls putting water safety at risk instead of alerting the public the epa stayed silent when an epa employee tried to speak out he was silenced the epa deferred to a state agency the mdeq which also failed to tell the public last month the epa administrator sent a memo creating a formal policy on the importance of assessing and responding to critical public health issues that the administrator had to remind employees of the importance of public health speaks to the misplaced priority of the epa and its officials so today we have to pass a law requiring the agency to notify the public when water quality is unsafe and constitutes a public health threat this legislation is a reminder to the epa that it needs to focus on its core responsibility with safe drinking water using its authority appropriately rather than overreaching outside of its jurisdiction this is an example of one community that has been adversely affected flint is not alone in this challenge and this has ramifications all across our country i urge my colleagues to support this bill"]], "top_unsure": [[3.8504600524902344e-05,

veterans waiting to have their claims processed after having served with us this 5 million shift i think will be helpful in that backlog as we already know that the va is at least 171 000 claims behind in their process these 171 000 claims are behind by more than 125 days which is unacceptable of course the vas top priority should be making sure that veterans have their claims processed and
