when it comes to charity it reminds me of the evolution that we have gone through in this country the old saying was charity begins at home now it seems that charity begins in some sort of government office at least that is the perception i think that we have gone from what used to be charity to welfare to entitlements and the progression as i see it works like this under charity if you desire to assist someone you do it out of the goodness of your heart out of your desire to help your fellow man you can impose whatever conditions you desire to impose or no conditions whatsoever on what you do for them if you think that they need to have some corrections in their own behavior as a condition to receiving some assistance you can say ill help you if you will do something that is charity but then we got to a situation where we have welfare replacing charity and welfare of course is coming from the government and welfare has the same purpose of assisting people but it does not have the conditions that are attached to it a person gets welfare because the government enables anyone to receive that and there is no correcting mechanism where receipt of something depends upon behavior or abstaining from some sort of other behavior and people began to have what i can an igaveattheoffice syndrome why should they dip into their own pockets or take their own time to assist so much in charity if thegovernment is going to do it through welfare but it goes a step further and says its not only the government giving you something through a welfare mechanism but its an entitlement if the government fails to give it to you you can sue you can demand you can insist you can go to court you can win and compel the government to give these things to you and again of course there is no link to your behavior there is no correcting mechanism whereby you are encouraged to become independent or you are encouraged to avoid the type of behavior that perhaps helped you get in the situation that you are in or that you learn the types of behavior that will make you selfsufficient now of course we have discussion of changing government programs workfare rather than welfare trying to link it to some behavior but every time that we have to go through a government bureaucracy we have tremendous inefficiency we do not have someone who is there acting out of a motivation of kindness and concern they are doing it because it is their job to do so and you will never have the same effectiveness upon someones behavior as when they know that you are acting purely out of the goodness of your own heart you are doing it because you desire to assist people it is always remarkable to me that so many people continue to engage in the many good works that they do that we do still have so many volunteer groups in this country that do so many good deeds and that reach out to help their fellow men and their fellow women as well but a lot of people are having that killed we are being told that charity is no longer what you do with your own money it is your willingness to dip into somebody elses pocket and compel them to pay through the government through the tax system we have lost track of the 3foot rule the 3foot rule is what you do when you reach out with your arm and you get into your own wallet instead we have got the long arm of government going out and i do not consider it charity if i cast a vote to compel other people in this country to contribute to a welfare state i consider it charity when i take of my own time and my own money and my own commitment to reach out and help someone else i do not want to kill charity in this country and i do not want my children to live in an environment where they think the world owes them a living that america owes them a living that they are entitled to things that are not linked to their behavior not linked to selfreliance to independence to honesty to forthright dealings with their fellow man i want them to see that linkage we need to have the security that comes not from a government handout but from a solid strong stable family we need government policies that encourage that i know the president has been speaking recently upon the theme of security he will call it personal security economic security health security how about family security the laws in america have been skewed against the family look at the divorce laws it started in the 1970s in your home state of california with passing no fault divorce laws currently every state in america except south dakota says that if you want to get divorced you only have to meet one requirement you must be married you do not have any linkage to behavior you do not have any concern over what will this do to the children as far as whether the divorce is going to be granted we need to have a linkage with the best interest of the child and realize that a marriage is not just an arrangement between a man and a woman it is also something that involves the children we need government policies whether it is changes in divorce laws whether it is changes in the tax code where we do not encourage we do not give the same tax incentives for families to stay together as we used to with the personal exemptions we have a child care tax credit that only goes to parents that work outside of the home the tax rates themselves the marriage penalty we need to change these policies that is part of the linkage that you were talking about between economic policy and social policy if we want america to be strong we need to give people more freedom to stay at home more frequently and do things with their kids instead of feeling a financial pinch to go out i realizse there am other gpeogge who wart to wgeak bat i thtak that i s importaoa

aisle have is that we are facing the largest tax increase in the history of the united states that has been proposed by president clinton in fact it is notjust the largest tax increase in the history of the united states it is more than double more than double the largest tax increase in the history of the united states in fact the tax increase that president clinton has proposed totals over 400 billion when we take that kind of money out of the collective pockets of the people of this country we hurt the economy dramatically if we do not buy 400 billion dollars worth of products they do not produce 400 billion dollars worth of products if the people of this country do not spend the 400 billion that they are going to pay in taxes to the government they do not buy 400 billion dollars worth of products cars refrigerators clothes and other products if those products are not purchased they are not going to be manufactured because the manufacturers of cars and refrigerators and clothes and other products will not manufacture products that are not going to be sold when we stop producing products and we start cutting back on employment because the assembly lines are not going to be going full tilt if they are not selling those products that is what has always happened whenever we have had massive tax increases two years ago 3 years ago when we had the budget summit agreement of 1990 it had one of the largest tax increases in unitedstates history 184 billion what did that lead us to it led us to an economic recession we saw unemployment go up we saw production go down we saw us lose in the trade war with our friends across the world and that is the same thing that is going to happen again only it will be worse in addition to just having a tax increase the kinds of tax increases president clinton is talking about are very onerous ones the btu tax the energy tax he is talking about we call it the big time unemployment tax the btu tax is going to add about 15 cents a gallon to jet fuel the airline industries tell us that will put many of them out of business they are on the borderline right now unitedstates air recently merged with british airways or had a contractual deal with them in addition to the airlines that may go out of business because of this huge increase in jet fuels i have had many people come to me who are farmers who tell me that the cost of agriculture is going to be huge and it is going to put a lot of them out of business we have had foundries come to us and tell us it is going to put the foundry industry in a very difficult situation they are already experiencing very difficult trade problems right now from competitors overseas many of them will go out of business the trucking industry is going to pay another 10 to 15 cents a gallon for fuel and that will be added to the cost of refrigerators and cars and clothes that are transported around this country that means that we are going to have an inflationary pressure on those products we buy that is not the problem that i want to talk about tonight the problem that we want to talk about here tonight is that with all these huge tax increases we are going to continue to see the national debt go up and up and up and up president clinton has told us he is going to cut spending but when we look at the proposals he sent to the congress of the united states we find that domestic spending is going to increase by about 94 billion over the next 5 years not go down it is going to go up 94 billion he is raising taxes over 400 billion and domestic spending is going to go up the only area he is going to be cutting is defense and he is going to be cutting defense to the tune of about 127 billion that will cut into the muscle and bone of our defense capability at a time when there is a lot of uncertainty in the world in former yugoslavia in russia in the former soviet union the place we should be very careful about cutting we can make cuts in defense but we must not cut into the muscle and bone that is the only place that president clinton is making major cuts huge tax increases huge increases in domestic spending and the only place he is going to cut is in the area of defense what are we going to be faced with the projections are that thedeficit instead of going down is going to go up over the next 4 to 5 years maybe not as rapidly as it would have otherwise but it is still going to go up in the next week we are going to be asked in this body to increase the debt ceiling by a quarter of a trillion dollars and that is not for a very long period of time in fact we are going to increase the debt ceiling for 6 months by increasing the debt by 250 billion that is intolerable what we need to do if we are going to be talking about any change in our debt structure is to put a cap on government spending and to get a balanced budget amendment that will control the spending in this body and the other body and to get a lineitem veto so that the president will be able to line out those items which are wastefulw"], [0.4859444200992584, 0.4859444200992584, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i know members want to go home but this story is too good not to be told about the pattern of spending in this house the first thing i wanted to talk about is the deal the deal that was made that we were going to cut 26 billion from the housepassed version of the budget now as members can see from the housepassed version of this budget our math would say that when we cut 26 billion and we get up with a compromise it says we will split the difference when we say we are going to cut 26 but we are going to split the difference that means we ought to come out with 13 that is the way we figure it out in ohio half of 26 is 13 but what we did is we took half of 26 and what we came out with was 5 8 billion less than the housepassed level that is the first problem we are not splitting the difference of the 26 billion now let us talk about the first years cuts that we were going to do what happened was senator exon agreed that we would cut in the first year in the first year the only year that counts the only year that matters we would cut 1 6 billion deeper than what we did in the house 1 6 their math was 1 6 but we would split the difference on that we would not cut the full 1 6 we would just split the difference like the deal was so when we split the difference of the 16 we come out with 8 but it is interesting when the conference split the difference of the 1 6 they came out with 5 so we went from a 1 6 billion cut in the first year this mammoth 1 6 billion cut in the first year we said we cannot afford all that so wehave to cut it in half and instead of going to 800 million which is what half of it would be we did not even achieve that we are at 5 it gets better my colleagues this is the spending difference this is the chart i bring a lot of charts out here to the floor but there is no chart quite like this one the housepassed deficit in the bill that we passed the deficit in the housepassed version was 175 3 billion in deficits now we take the 5 remember the 5 i just showed members here and we subtract it from 175 billion that should give us an expected deficit of 174 8 billion because if you take a half a billion in the cuts subtract it from the housepassed deficit that gives you a lower deficit by half a billion dollars right but guess what happened the actual conference deficit is 175 4 billion in essence the deal that we got out of the conference committee that is supposed to cut spending increases the deficit so let me tell members what i told senator exon today we are going to have an increase in the deficit of 600 million as a result of the exongrassley 26 billion out so i told senator exon maybe we ought to think about spending more because the more we cut the deeper in debt we go can you imagine my colleagues that we actually are emerging from the conference committee and i want to repeat this so no one is confused because of the efforts to cut 26 billion by grassley and exon which was supposed to be shaved to 13 which did not end up 13 only ended up 5 8 and in the first year we were supposed to cut 1 6 billion in year one the only year that matters 1 6 but we did not cut 1 6 we only cut a half billion but if we were to cut a half a billion from what the deficit was going to be our deficits ought to be lower and in fact deficits and spending go up deficits in spending go up as a result of that deal let us get back to the sliver you all remember the sliver that i brought out here before this is the sliver i do not have my magnifying glass tonight to show the members but they might notice here that exongrassley cuts from 5 to 99 1 know members are having trouble seeing it it is a good chance to see whether members need eyeglasses or not but there is a sliver here this what the exongrassley cut would be that represented a 3 percent cut in total federal spending this is the exongrassley cut that represented 3 percent of spending that was too deep for the conference committee so what they came up with was a 07 percent cut which is even smaller than the 03 percent cut that was called for under exongrassley we keep hearing about these 3 years of declining deficits this is what we get with deficits as we can see they are headed back up again it is interesting is it not that they are actually trying to claim deficit reduction for 1993 when the first year of the presidents proposal affecting the budget started in 1994 they do not have 3 years of declining deficits as of this point we will have to see what happens here is the result let us go back let us go back one more time to the fact that cutting spending in the house of representatives actually resulted in an increase in the deficit as we came out of conference this does not sell anywhere this is not right this is not what we ought to be doing what i would suggest is that we defeat this conference report what we send this thing back to the conference committee and let us do some real deficit reduction i hear about all the good economic news and i am pleased that we have seen some growth in this economy but what the markets are saying the markets are saying that they do not believe that a pattern of increased taxes and increased government and increased regulation is good for the longterm growth and job prospects and low inflationary prospects and low interest rate prospects for the united states of america let us send this back to committee and let us really do a good job of giving the american people what they really want i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.486033171415329, 0.486033171415329, 0, "and the republican incumbents and challengers it will go to the top 20 percent of the wage earners in the country and the cost 5 years from now will be 8 billion per year then they are going to provide a 500 tax credit for every child that has some merit at the lower income levels though it does nothing for people who make under 16 000 a year no matter how many children they have because they are not in a taxable category it does nothing for them and it gives twice the amount of tax cut to a couple making 180 000 as it does a couple making 40 000 and i suspect that one of the ways they are going to try to pay for this is to either cut or do away with the earned income tax credit which actually did give lower middleincome and poor people in this country a substantial tax break so while i champion the idea of a middleclass income tax cut and you can do it with increasing the tax credits for children that is one way of doing itit still has to be paid for i have no idea what the cost of that is they want to cut the corporate tax even though corporate profits are at an all time high there is just a goody in there for everybody and it is estimated that it will cost i guess over the next 5 years 388 billion and then you get down to the really interesting part of the proposal and that is how are you going to pay for it people in the country that are paying attention ought to be euphoric about the conditions of the economy but especially about this dramatic reduction in the deficit let me just digress a moment to say virtually everybody on this side of the aisle voted for the budget reconciliation bill last year which raised taxes 250 billion and cut spending 250 billion and was calculated to reduce the deficit by 500 billion over a 5year periodnot balance the budget but cut it 500 billion below what it otherwise would be and now that figure is up to about 670 billion in deficit reduction it was a very courageous vote by the 50 people on this side of the aisle who voted for it you know the people send mixed signals to members of congress they say on the one hand why dont you people stiffen your spine and make the tough votes why dont you vote courageously for a change but mr president do you know what a tough courageous vote is it is by definition an unpopular vote and so when you cast that unpopular vote as we did last summer to raise taxes on the richest 1 2 percent of the people in this country in an effort to do something about the deficit because they are the ones who can best afford it when you do that and you go home there is not a dirt farmer in arkansas that did notthink we had raised his taxes it took a lot of tall explaining because it was an unpopular vote but mr president you cannot deal with a 4 trillion debt by making everybody happy the happy talk that we got in 1980 cost us 3 trillion in 12 years what a siren song we got in 1980increase defense spending cut taxes and balance the budget and that is the same siren song you heard yesterday afternoon on the steps of the unitedstates capitol the same snake oil we tried that 3 trillion ago but back to the courageous vote when you cast that courageous vote then you go home and your constituents say you clowns dont care what i think you just vote the way you want to it is an ambivalent signal so where is all of this money going to come from to keep the deficit from soaring again well i will tell you they say they are going to use the 124 billion i guess that we were going to get under president clintons health care reform for medicare 114 billion from medicaid that is all well and good the problem is we did not get the clinton health care bill if you want to cut medicare by that amount and medicaid by that amount that is just fine but be prepared for an outcry and if you wantto do welfare reform which they refer to in quotes welfare reform and pick up 100 billion tell the states tell my governor and your governor who are on us constantly about mandating programs that they have to pay for we mandate it they have to figure out how to pay for it you tell them where they are going to find the money to provide health care for the poorest of the poor in their state under medicaid when we cut 114 billion you tell them what they are going to do for the poor people when we cut food stamps and aid for families with dependent children by 50 billion we have a bill that we are going to consider before we leave here to provide some relief to the states from the kind of mandates they have been squawking about when i was governor of my state we were forever and eternally requiring the cities of my state to raise the salaries of firemen i came from a town so small we did not have a fire department so that was all a mystery to me but we were always raising the salaries of firemen because it was popular with the firemen but we did not send them any money and the mayors would converge on my office and say look youre requiring us to raise the salaries of our people by cutting their work week we dont have the money all i could do was stand tlwre with a blank face and that is what congress is doing to the states and that is what has governors absolutely livid so to those people who stood on the steps yesterday afternoon i invite you to tell the governors of this nation where they are going to find the money to make up for this 388 billion that you are going to cut to pay for all these wonderful tax cuts for the welltodo well if you ask for a more specific definitive method of cutting spending they have the best answer i have ever heard how are we going to cut 388 billion why we are going to amend the constitution of the united states to say that congress has to provide for a balanced budget aint that beautifuljust write a little provision into the constitution saying ye shall have a balanced budget i have never voted for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in my life but if that is all there were to it i would be for it if all i had to do was stand on the floor and say i know that some mysterious thing was going to happen to balance the budget count me in unhappily you have to be a big snake oil buyer to believe that well they said we are also going to add the lineitem veto which transfers more and more power to the president of the united states and away from the legislative branch i do not feel nearly as strongly and i do not oppose the lineitem veto nearly to the extent i do the balanced budget amendment but neither one of them will balance the budget what will balance the budget is a majoritystrike that60 unitedstates senators standing on their hind legs and saying i care about the future of the country i deplore the lack of hope and the lack of faith that exists across this great land i have said this before and it is not ismart for a politician to say it but i am going to say it anyway if i had a goal of being carried out of the unitedstates senate in a pine box i know exactly how to vote i would do like a lot of people do i would get out of bed in the morning i would walk out on my front porch and decide which way the wind was blowing and what the overnight polls showed and that is the way i would vote but sometimes that can be very very wrong not only sometimes but often is wrong i do not believe the people elected a single member of the unitedstates senate to simply do what is popular at any given moment it was irresistible in 1980 the people found it irresistible to believe that you could actually increase defense spendingyea double itand cut taxes and balance the budget one old farmer in arkansas said what a dynamite idea i wonder why nobody ever thought about that before we now know why we have a 4 trillion debt to show for it let the same people who stood on the steps yesterday take a poll among their number see how many of them are willing to vote against the space station ask them how many of them are willing to torpedo milstar a worthless communications system down at the defense department that costs billions and billions of dollars how many of them would be willing to cut back on d5 missile purchases which costs billions and i guarantee you most of the people who stood on those steps yesterday support another 20 b2 bombers more aircraft carriers more everything because they are scared to death if they do not when they go home their opponent is going to say they are soft would say to my constituents you on defense want responsible government you and what is this group out on the want fiscal responsibility you want capitol steps going to do about those your children and grandchildren to mandates we are going to be imposing grow up in a nation that is fiscally reon the states they take care of that sponsible and can educate its children too they are going to pay the states and feed its poor and provide for a for all the mandates we are going to strong military we are doing every bit cut welfare afdc food stamps all of of it right now and reducing the deficit those programs and dump it back on at the same time the statesbut tell them we will reim why are people not dancing in the burse them for it where is the savings streets i do not know so i close where of course it is popular with the gov i started by saying the mood of the ernors of the states to say we are people of the country is unfathoniable going to fund all these mandates it is to me i know where a lot of it started popular with the people of this country term limits it is an expression of the to say you are going to cut welfare by peoples frustration about gridlock 50 billion here in the unitedstates senate it is a frustraif you want to get a big standing ova tion about scandals from time to time tion at the banquet just tell them it is a frustration about the fact that that there are 100 people here who are real personal income is 20 percent less pretty savvy they know what the ap today than it was in 1970 it is because plause lines are they know how to they dont believe their children will play a crowd tell them you can have have as good a life as they have had it all there is no tomorrow my parents told me they wanted a one of the congressmen who stood on better life for me than they had when the steps yesterday afternoon said if they were growing up when i was a we do not do what we say the people child during the depression of course ought to throw us out that was easy it was almost imposi would change that and say if you sible not to have a better life than we do what you say the people will surely had when we were children but my fathrow you out but the deficit will be ther told me so many times son i up another 2 trillion when they get want all of you children to have every around to it opportunity for a good education bethen they call for a balanced budget cause i want you to hqve a better life by the year 2003 we are not onlygoing than ive had to balance the budget in 2003 by cut he and my mother had worked hard ting medicare and medicaid and un tilled the soil taught school ran a specified welfare reform and other un business scraped up enough money so specified cuts we are going to do it that together with the gi bill all three through economic growth does that of us could get a good education sound familiar that was always the today parents cannot look at their answer in 1980 children and honestly say you are how are you going to cut taxes raise going to have a better life than i had defense spending and balance the budg an awful lot of children and young et adults have lost faith in the future of when you out peoples taxes there is this nation and there is not a member going to be so much economic activity of the unitedstates senate who does not know and they are going to pay so much in what to do about that it is a question income tax the whole thing will just of whether we have the moral courage balance out the political stamina and the intelleoi think maybe we are getting ready tual honesty to do what it takes to say to get back on the bill and i do not yes things are going to be better for want to take up more time but i just your children and here is why want to issue this admonition it all over the world people are scratchsounds a bit preachy but so be it if ing and clawing incidentally to get to the american people should by some this country with all its flaws we are stretch of the imagination buy into still the oldest democracy on earth it what i saw in the paper this morning is not working too well right now but and what i have seen from the budget we still have it we have that magnificommittee about that proposal they cent constitution we have these great are saying we do not really care how institutions called the supreme court big the deficit is the department of justicewhich is i can remember when they did it is not always fair but at least you get a a strange anomaly is it not that for shot at a fair trial by a jury of your years the catalyzing political issue in peers those institutions and others this country was the deficit and last are all in place and people all over the year the deficit was down about 50 bil world are scratching and clawing to get lion and this year it is going to be to the shores of this nation and we down almost 100 billion less than it are trashing the system as never bewas projected to be 18 months ago and fore what a paradox back to the people who voted that cou i made a graduation speech about 3 rageous vote last summer i have told weeks ago and i made these points those who are up for reelection this that those clowns in congress that you yearand every one of them is getting hear talked about in coffee shops all hammered by his opponents about it across americathis is the good part i would not wait for my opponent to of the speech because it is complimenbring it up i would bring it up first i tary of congressthose clowns in washington for all of their foibles and their failures and their lack of courage have provided this nation with 205 years of uninterrupted infettered freedom no other nation on earth can even come close to that claim so why are people not dancing in the streets one of the reasons is rush limbaugh does not think that he does not think people have any reason to dance in the streets there must be 500 little rush limbaughs across the country who believe that everything is wrong every day jefferson said one time the price of freedom is eternal vigilance that means different things to different people but we have it and i do not want to lose it i do not want to lose our economic freedoms i do not want to lose our political freedoms i want to see our culture mean something i want us to spend money on educating our children and providing health care for our people i want more people to appreciate the constitution of the united states and their right and privilege to vote i took my family to the eastern shore the weekend after labor day i could not afford to rent any of that property on labor day weekend i had to wait until the weekend after labor day but it was not nearly as crowded and a lot more pleasant i have three great childrenall married to inlaws that we love believe it or notand two wonderful grandchildren we spent 4 days at the beach and on the way home betty and i were returning home through two states i will not mention which ones i stopped to get gas and this fellow was pumping gas into my car i said how is the senate race going over here he said you asking me yeah i aint never voted in my life and aint never going to really no it dont make no difference just like that place right over there what place right over there that place over there where they are supposed to take in old folks half of them over there are 35 and under you dont want to vote to change that if that is true no it wouldnt make no difference i did not really want to pursue this conversation with this gentlemen any further but i did tell him i said you know every time we have an election and you do not vote you are voting against the system that has provided you with all these freedoms i am getting off the beaten path i just want to say the price of freedom really is eternal vigilance and it also requires a few courageous votes from time to time around here if you look at civilization and read barbara tuchmans book the march of folly and see what has happened to civilizations that ignore a lot of voices crying in the wilderness it has often been fatal do not do that even yamamoto said do not bomb pearl harbor you people do not know anything about the united states you will not win that war the warlords ran over him like a mack truck he could not stop them even the trojan horse when the greeks put the trojan horse outside troys bastille the debate was should we let that horse in here one man spoke up and said that is a greek trick dont doit its a long story but they let the trojan horse in and the rest is history in world war i a couple of german uboat commanders said you are depending on us to sink all that allied shipping and we cannot do it you ought to read that book march of folly by barbara tuchman she just died a couple years ago she was a magnificent historian and throughout the book cool collected intelligent voices said dont do that politically it is wonderful but in effect it is going to be disastrous so i worry about what happened on the capitol steps yesterday but i cannot imagine peoples memories being so short that they would buy into voodoo economics ii after we tried it 12 years ago14 years ago nowat a

of welfare reform i have a bill that i have introduced which is h r 1293 iwould like to start out by telling you all a statistic which i think is a startling statistic at least it amazed me by the year 2000 80 percent of minority children and 46 percent of all children will be born illegitimate in the united states i would like to tell you another statistic which i think is significant if you graduate from high school if you get married and you do not have your first child until you are 20 of that group only 8 percent live in poverty but if you do not graduate from high school if you do not get maried and if you have your first child as a teen 80 percent of that group live in poverty now our policies i think in this country have encouraged illegitimacy and have encouraged poverty these policies were enacted with the best of intentions they were enacted to assist people to help people but it did not work out that way and i thine it is time to admit that we are doing somethin very very wrong in this country and change the way that we are doing things now a number of us have thought about this a great deal to have a good welfare reform bill it should cost less not more if someone tells you that they have a welfare reform idea but it is going to cost another 30 bilion it is probably not welfare reform it is probably more of the same a good welfare reform bill should end the entitlement nature of afdc now r think most of the people who are listening probably are aware that an entitlement is a program where we describe certain parameters in the law then if you fit into those parameters you are conaidered entitled to money there are three large entitlements in the afdc welfare program afdc food stamps and medicaid another large program housing is not an entitlement so there are three large entitlements and the housing program that cost significant money with the afdc population i think to have a good welfare reform program we have to end the entitlement nature of afdc because with an entitlement the money just flows we do not even appropriate specific amounts in congress it is just such sums as may be necessary and the money lust flows so you can say we are going to have a program and there will be sanctions if afdc recipients do not live up to the terms of this program but if the money just flows anyway somehow sanctions never really fall also a good welfare reform program should address the problem of teenage pregnancy and it should address the problem of paternal identification i am going to tell you what my bill does and then talk a little bit more generally about the problem my bill would freeze afdc right where it is that ends the entitlement nature of afdc it would return afdc in block grants to the states and give the states absolutely maximum flexibility in what they do because all of the good things that are happening in welfare all of the good ideas are conming from the states we ought to give this block of money to the states and give them maximum flexibility with only two mandates those mandates would be no afdc unless and until both parents are 1 and no afdc at ay age unless the father is absolutely identifiedand that does not mean i guess it was bill jones that means william j jones born january 20 1978 with a social security number or an address so that we absolutely know who that person is what we have been saying to young women and the reason i say no afdcuntil both parents are 18 is because what we have been saying to young women in this country with our policies for a great many years is if you will have two children with no man in the house we will give you s50 a month afdc 30 a month food stamps we will pay all your medical bills we will find you a place to live and pay for it for about a third of you we will send you t a college or a training school to help get you off welfare we will give you 3200 a month child care while you are taking that college or training school and we will give you 21 a month transportation round trip now if you are a mature person you know that that is not a lot of money and it is not going to be a great life although it is 18 00 a year but if you are 14 and you want to get out of the house and you are under some boyfriend pressure and some peer pressure and you wanted something to love you are liable to take that offer and by 15 you are pregnant and by 16 you are caught in that welfare trap for the rest of your life i think the other mandate no afdc unless the father is absolutely identifled is because what we say now to young men is and what we have been saying for many years is go ahead walk away from this program we will take care of this for you and with my bill what we would be saying is if you have no money we will help this woman and this child but we know exactly who you are and when you are earning 15 000 or 20 000 or 5000 a year we are going to have a part of that for every child that you have fathered i think this is not a harsh bill it is a bill that attempts to get people to take responsibility for their own children again let me repeat what it does because some people have said it sounds harsh it freezes one of the entitlements does not cut it freezes it it says that the states will have maximum flexibility to design their own programs it says no afdc unless both parents are 18 it does not take away food stamps does not take away medicaid and it says no afdc at any age until we absolutely know who the father is and i do not think it is a harsh bill at all i think it is a bill that will allow a great many people 5 million families in the united states it will allow a great many people to have a better life and to create a better environment in which to raise their children now you are going to hear a great deal from the president about let us make people work and 2 years and out and that sounds very good and you have heard that it takes a while to explain my program but i have noticed if you say to a room full of people let us make people work everybody thinks that sounds so good and they applaud but the truth is we have tried this once and it did not work in 1988 we fashioned a welfare bill that said we will have a work training program a job readiness program a job search program we will pay child care we will pay transportation and everybody will go to work and i waited and i watched for 5 years it was supposed to cost 3 billion we predicted in 1988 it would cost 3 billion and it cost 13 billion and less than 1 percent of the welfare population is working and now the president is talking about doing exactly this same thing again he says it would cost 10 billion over the next 5 years and he is talking about funding it in a variety of ways he talked about a gambling tax and he talked about a tax on annuities and he talked about taking away veterans benefits he has talked about taking away benefits from higher income farmers he has talked about a variety of ways the thing is he is taking benefits away from working people in most of these instances in order to pay 10 billion more for a program that we know has failed in 1988 we predicted this program is going to be successful and at the end of 1998 we will have 5 million families on welfare we hit that goal in early 1993 when you make the program better when you add something to it people flood onto the program they came onto the program infinitely faster than we thought they would they took all the programs and no one went to work my bill would save 6 billion to 8 billion over the next 5 years the presidents would cost 10 billion over the next 5 years that is a 16 to 18 billion difference that i think we could use in a variety of ways in this country and ways that would help people in a much more meaningful way than a work program that has failed once before now i strongly believe in work programs i come from the midwest we have a very strong work ethic there but we have proved already that federal work programs do not work and the state statistics show that our federallymandated plan does not work why we live in a huge diverse country and one of the reasons why a federallymandated program does not work i think is because what works in new jersey does not necessarily work in kansas just think about the difference between miami fl and billings mt i mean it is a tremendous difference in this country and when we try to overlay two huge new entitlements a work program and a day care program on the country it does not work very well the second reason a federally mandated program does not work is because i believe you have to end the entitlement nature of afdc in order to have any program work because as long as the money just continues to flow no matter what you say the sanctions never fall the money just continues to flow and that is what happened in 1988 i think a third reason why state programs work much better than federal programs is because the states can target these programs better we know where the problems are in kansas we know the areas where there are jobs available but we might need training programs to get people fitted for those jobs we know where there are areas of high teenage pregnancy and we do not so much need work programs as we need teenage pregnancy programs we know where there are areas where maybe there are not jobs available and you have to work with city or county governments and get people to work at jobs that the city and the country needs done and that they would be willing to assist in paying for them working in the state i think it is time that we changed the way that we are doing things currently that we not reauthorize a failed work program and day care program and that we end the entitlement nature of afdc give more flexibility to the states say no afdc unless and until both parents are 18 and no afdc at any age until the father is absolutely identified why is this important to all of us why is this important to my constituents i think it is terribly important because you are paying for it in so many ways you are paying for it in more ways than you probably realize all studies show that afdc children welfare children have lower test scores are more involved in crime and have more physical illnesses i am not saying in any way that afdc children are inherently bad certainly they are not i am not saying that a great many of them are not successful many of them are i am saying that studies show that these children are much more subject to lower test scores to being involved in crime and to physical illnesses this is a great cost to society in addition to that i would like to tell the members about the total cost of this program these are only federal figures and two of the programs are matching federal and state so this is by no means the total cost however afdc itself is 16 billion the afdc population is responsible for 20 percent of medicaid the rest goes to low income families and to the elderly in the nursing homes the afdc population is responsible for 20 percent of medicaid for 55 percent of food stamps for 30 percent of housing for virtually all of a number of smaller programs head start and wic when we put all of that together the annual cost to the unitedstates taxpaying citizens is 70 billion the cost of welfare is not going to go away i dont care what we do and certainly we want to help people i want to help people that need help but the program is a runaway program we have to stop itand get some kind of control of it i ask members to think if we only reduce that 70 billion cost by 10 percent a year we would have an extra 37 billion that we could utilize to help people in much more meaningful ways in addition to that we would not be reauthorizing a work program and a day care program that we know has failed and that would cost 10 billion i think it is time to change the way we are doing things i hope that all of my colleagues who are listening today will support and cosponsor h r 1293"], [0.48624300956726074, 0.48624300956726074, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding to me i would like to congratulate the gentleman for taking out the time on this special order as i was walking over here thinking about what i was going to say about gene chappie i was just having an exchange with my friend the gentleman from rockland ca mr doolrrrx who is now walking out of the chamber because he is probably nervous about what i might say about gene chappie i was struck by the fact that there is so many things that i could say which cannot be said here on the floor of the congress the gentleman from california very nicely referred to the fact that gene chappie kept everyone laughing with his jokes but he was so much of a diplomat in his statement that he did not say that many of those jokes are quite frankly very offcolor and i will say that he had members on both sides of the aisle laughing regularly he had yes the elevator operators robble the officer who stands right outside the corner of independence and new jersey people all over this capitol in stitches the point that comes home to me on this issue is the fact that gene chappie was a caring person who enjoyed seeing people happy and that is why he would go to a great deal of effort to ensure that that story which he could only tell in his inimitable way came through loudly and clearly i will say that he was a very caring person i found that out on many occasions i had the privilege of being elected with him in 1980 we came in and the gentleman from california reminded me that we gene chapple and i were among the 33 republican members who unseated entrenched democrat members of the house of representatives gene chappie unseated the chairman of the committee on public works and transportation mr johnson and he campaigned by riding in his jeep starting in cool ca his home all over that large district to which the gentleman from california referred and he had all kinds of great stories that he used to tell about those campaign experiences but he had a grassroots organization that really was built from the ground up he did it obviously in his other campaigns for county supervisor and as a member of the state legislature i was reminded when we recently planted a tree here our friend the gentleman from rediands ca mr lewis talked about the fact that gene chappie had been chairman of the rules committee in the assembly when the republicans were in the majority in 1970 and that of course made him one of the most influential people in the entire state of california so he had that leadership position he very much wanted to see this house of representatives go into republican hands he and i talked many times about the fact that we were going to see a majority and i remember one of the last things that he said to me when he made his decision to retire in 1985 was that he said david you are going to have a chance to see a republican majority in that house and i will say that as i see my friend the gentleman from glens falls new york mr solomon and the gentleman from california and the gentleman from california and others who desperately want to see that happen i want gino to know that we are still struggling with hope that we will soon have a republican majority in the house but quite frankly we all know it has not happened yet so i stay here because i enjoy this work and there are other reasons one of those is i often think about how gene chappie said to me as he decided to retire from this institution in 1986 that we are going to see a republican majority one of the little instances that comes to mind he would go around this capitol doing all kinds of wild and slightly irreverent things one day i was going to his office which was in the penthouse of the longworth building and he never chose to move from that office as i recall he moved into that office in his first term and stayed there throughout his entire tenure here but on his birthday several members of his staff got a little pig and put it in his office and he came in for his birthday and this pig was running all over his office and that created a bit of havoc as members of the media and constituents came in to visit him but he also took his work here very seriously even though he was one of the most lighthearted people you could possibly have serving in this institution he was very committed to the outdoors he represented that massive district which i guess is shared by the gentleman from california and the gentleman from california and i do not know who else has parts of that original district that chappie represented now but gene was clearly a man of the people and the earth and he was regularly enjoying it i deeply regret the fact that i never seized the opportunity to visit nancy and gino when they were regularly extending invitations for me to come up to northern california and visit them it is one of the regrets i will always carry with me that i did not get a chance to go up and visit i saw pictures and i heard great stories about it i want to say that i love the gentleman from california but there was a real void created when gene chappie left this place i have missed him ever since and was very saddened a year ago when i heard of his passing i am glad that we are able to rejoice in the great life that he had here and in california i was glad that we were able to plant that tree out here on the mall a few weeks ago i was bugging wally herger on a regular basis over the past year saying why cant we take time to talk about this great life of gene chappie and i am happy that we are finally able to be here tonight doing that i wish well to all the members of his family and i want him to know i want all of the members of his family to know that i greatly greatly miss their father and husband who was an inspiration and a source of much fulfillment and entertainment for many of us here

not about lobbyists lunches the motion to instruct conferees which will be offered if the rule goes down will not in any way touch the gift rule or lunches so all the speeches about that are irrelevant to the next two votes the vote coming up is an opportunity to do exactly what the house did on the crime bill to defeat a rule and reopen the conference now why would we want to do that let me start out by saying i think there are four reasons we want to return this bill to conference to change four key provisions that threaten the american peoples right to be active citizens there are four fi st the worst single thing which i doubt if many members even looked at yet is that if youre a citizen you can pay a 200 000 fine under this bill if youre a member you might not even be named in the incident in which a citizen pays a 3200 000 fine and i will return to that second there is in the judgment of those of us who are active in the grassroots a grassroots gag rule here and i will cite from grassroots catholic organizations their fear of being intimidated third there is an issue of who defines religious freedom and whether or not you truly want one person appointed by the clinton administration to define religious freedom and fourth the concept of that one person having virtually dictatorial powers powers over lobbying groups powers over every filing file powers over every penalty and for those of you on the left who think it is going to be fine if it is a clinton appointee how would you have felt during the bork nomination if that person had been a reagan appointee and you might say were going to get a paragon of virtue and theyll always be just and i suggest to you that is a long way from how the real world works now let me expand first we recently voted overwhelmingly to require the congress to be under the same laws as the rest of the country everywhere i go in america when i describe the shays act and say every member of congress will obey the same law this bill sets one standard of criminal and civil penalties for citizens and then exempts the member of congress from exactly the same activities i say to my colleagues now you cant vote for this bill you cant vote yes on the rule and go home and say you want to cover congress because this bill has two very different stand ards and i know that members have been reassured on both sides of the aisle oh you wont be covered the lobbyist might go to jail the citizen might pay 3200 000 but youll be ok dont be afraid of this that is wrong second when you read the provisions that define what the time of a lobbyist is 10 percent of their time paid as a lobbyist over 2 500 hours in 6 months is for a lobbyist one trip from california to visit your member of congress and two nights in a washington hotel and you may have passed the limit and then you are a citizen and you did not know you were supposed to file you would have to pay 10 percent because you belong to the california desert association something many of our friends on the left might be concerned about they say oh i want them to call and visit me but now they have got to fill out a form now they have to start registering because with 10 percent of their paid time in a statelevel organization they are visiting the 52 members of the california organization and believe me if you visit all the members of the california delegation that is 10 percent of your time now they are subject to a federal law with federal penalties under a federal involvement at the local grass roots and by the way this includes reporting when they are communicating with their own constituents it says specifically in here communicating with your own members of your own group that is covered and you have to report in aggregate on what you do that is not lobbying the unitedstates congress that is crippling the citizens right to be involved third on page 13 this bill describes religious freedom the exemption the gentleman from california referred to says they are exempted the church or religious institution is exemptedand this is page 13 if the communication constitutes the free exercise of religion i will say to my friends on the left that maybe from your standpoint an administration which appoints roberta achtenberg or an administration which appoints joycelyn elders might be fine for a single person appointed by this administration to define what constitutes religious freedom but i am not sure i want a papal message on abortion a papal message on homosexuality or a papal message on any other issue such as school prayer interpreted by a secular antireligious liberal as to whether or not that is a political message or a religious freedom message and finally there is the question of allowing one person to make these kinds of decisions you can vote yes today and you can say well i had to do it but let me say that someplace down the road some grotesque injustice is going to be enacted by a single person whohas a bias whether it is right or left or just personal but a single person who is given virtually dictatorial powers under this to punishand by the way for the same action they have a different penalty for different groups based on their interpretation of motive this is a dangerous bill all we are asking is this we are not asking to beat the bill we are asking members to vote no on the rule as they did on the crime bill send it back to conference and let them fix those parts this has nothing to do with lunches this has nothing to do with gifts this has to do with fixing some very dangerous provisions and then we can bring it back next week and we can debate any other provisions but for today i say do not accept the flawed docunlent from the conferees do not threaten the rights of our fellow citizens do not threaten religious freedom and do not turn over dictatorial powers of government and finally do not vote for a 200 000 fine on citizens and nothing to punish members of congress that is wrong"], [0.48638758063316345, 0.48638758063316345, 0, "i yield myself 7 minutes i want to speak on this side of the aisle because i want to make an appeal to the majority to at least give some consideration to what i amtrying to do in this world bank amendment i think when the members hear the facts they will be unable to reach any other conclusion than that we need not to shut the bank down but we need to withhold the 56 million capital increase that the world bank is asking for why do i say that mr chairman i just want the members on this side to listen to the facts along with the republican members of this congress i want the members to think about this the world bank is now rebuilding its headquarters it is going to cost the rebuilding of their headquarters 250 million to rebuild the world bank headquarters that is despite a costcutting effort that they have made to take out the pure marble floors and instead substitute terrazzo floors we closed the european development bank down because of the marble problems the same thing is going on in the world bank headquarters 250 million that is only the beginning of what is going on at this uncontrolled unaudited operation firstclass travel firstclass travel by the world bank costs the world bank 30 million a year do the members understand what i am saying if the people who work at the world bank decided to fly coach and not first class they would save 30 million a year a person can go play golf if they happen to know someone who works at the world bank at the world bank golf course out in potomac md do the members know why they built it because there were some diplomats in town who could not join burning tree and they needed a place to play golf so they opened up the bretton woods golf course owned jointly by the world bank and the international monetary fund that is just the beginning they are fed by world class chefs and the operating costs of the world bank are 1 billion a year so they own their own golf course they fly first class at a cost of 30 million a year they are rebuilding their building at a cost of 250 million and their average employee salary costs 123 000 that sounds like the kind of benefits that we would like to have for an operation that is being very successful we would think that wouldnt we i also forgot to tell the members by the way they do not pay income taxes on the 123 000 salary so 250 million for a new building 30 million in firstclass travel costs they own their own golf course they pay no taxes and what else their failure rate their failure rate of loans their failure rate of their projects is 37 5 percent it has grown over the last 10 years almost 40 percent of the projects that they are involved with are deemed failures and that estimate has not been made by an independent outside officer the 37 5percent failure rate is an internal world bank audit what are we asking them to do oh by the way testifying against the world bank loans just so the members know because their loans have resulted in environmentally destructive projects how about this the environmental defense fund the sierra club the friends of the earth and the national wildlife federation testified that the world bank projects are environmentally destructive they are displacing millions of people all over the earth they made loans last year to iran 5 billion in loans that the united states objected to 5 billion they just thumbed their nose at the united states and said we are going to do it anyway if you dont like it though what are we proposing in this amendment we are saying that we do not want to close down the world bank but we are saying do not increase the flow let me tell the members another thing they have to understand there is a 10 billion margin if we do not give them the 58 million it does not matter because they have enough loan margins and enough reflows to be able to make 10 billion more in loans than what they are currently planning i say to the members there is no consistency for this 56 million increase they have a track record of failure they have no independent audit the wapenhans report the morris report every report that has looked at them has said they are out of control the head of the treasury of canada said they have a deteriorating portfolio they have a margin to make these loans and i am saying please in the house can we just step up to the plate and approve one reform measure we are not going to jeopardize russian aid or any kind of aid in this proposal we can come back a year from now and increase the flow if we have to yesterday we did not accept the hard choice on aid we got threequarters of a loaf not the full loaf this one it just speaks for itself their projects are not making sense they are environmentally damaging their internal operations are out of control their costs are going through the roof i am asking my democrat friends my colleagues that run into me on the stairs and in the gymnasium and sidewalks and say that is a good idea but i just cannot vote with you come on let us belly up here and let us cast a vote that sends a message to the world bank that says to them what you are doing is not tolerated anymore in this country we want it to be fixed and i ask you to approve the amendment that i am offering along with my colleague the gentleman from connecticut

the question to members involving the resolution supporting the action of the president and the peace delegation the negotiating delegation and of course the american soldiers the military personnel who went to haiti this is not unusual that when you have a military action or a quasimilitary action often the question is put to the house members generally after the fact after the decision has been made to send those people to support the troops there was no compelling interest national interest served in my estimation that would justify going into haiti military forces whether you call it an invasion an inyasion with permission an occupation or whatever in the instances in recent years when we have gone into nations in this hemisphere such as grenada such as panama we had what i would call compelling national reasons for doing that in grenada we had hundreds of american medical students who were surrounded by the communist thugs who had just machinegunned mauric6 bishop and others at fort rupert a few miles away in the words of these students when they were saved by american rangers and brought back to the united states and here i am paraphrasing what a lot of them said and what a lot of their parents said we were in imminent danger we thank you for bringing us back with respect to the panama canal that action under president bush we had of course a compelling justiflcation which was the canal itself a strategic asset to the united states i in this case i think the president made no compelling justification in fact there appears unfortunately that some of the statements that he made early on to increase american support for this actions such as calling general cedras alluding to him in a way that he was a bloodthirsty terrorist hearing that from the president and then a short time later after this socalled agreement had been made hearing him refer to general cedras as an honorable man i think raised a lot of confusion in the minds of americans had he become an honorable man over the last several hours because he now made an agreement with the president was he still a bloodthirsty terrorist was it really a reason for american troops to be introduced into haiti yesterday when the issue came before the house of representatives both republicans and democrats obviously the time for debating whether we should go into haiti was over because the president had sent troops into haiti we were asked to support the troops andof course republicans and democrats support the troops some members on both sides decided not to support that resolution they felt that the troops already knew who supports them in the united states congress and they did not need to do that others of us felt whenever you have troops carrying out a military operation it is important to let them know about that but let me tell you what most members on the republican side of the aisle do not support i think most of us did not support the operation in the first place we do not support the notion that there is a compelling national interestin being in haiti another thing that we do not support though and you are not going to see this coming from the republican side of the aisle while you did see it coming from the democrat side of the aisle from some of the more liberal members during the 1980s let me go over a few of the things you will not see you are not going to see any dear commandante letters that was a letter sent to the communist dictator of nicaragua by the democrat leadership at a time when american interests were strongly opposed by the communists the sandinistas in nicaragua at a time when freedom fighters were dying under sovietmade helicopter gunships and ak47s manufactured in the soviet union moved in by soviet intelligence operatives into nicaragua you are not going to see members of the american congress going down and trying to strategize with certain elements in haiti as to how best to frustrate american policy you saw all those things coming from the liberal democrat leadership in this house of representatives during the 1980s during the contra wars you are not going to see members of the republican side of the unitedstates congress going down and meeting with adversaries to american interests trying to figure out how to frustrate an american president so this is president clintons move he has made it about 6 weeks about the election i think the timing is unfortunate because obviously everything the president does now is tinged with political ramifications that is clear i think he owed it to the american people to wait until the election was over so there were be no question as to whether or not he was trying to move his polls for his party a little bit before the upcoming election i think most americans feel that that is a misuse of the lives of our uniformed personnel to move them around the globe in any way immediately before an election i wish he had not done that but not that he has done it i think he has brought our focus to something else that something else is the issue of what president clinton and the liberal democrat leadership of the house and the senate had done to american military posture what happened to the great military machine that was built during the 1980s under the leadership of ronald reagan and george bush where we restored the hollow military that had been left to us by the carter administration we rebuilt the american navy we rebuilt our strategic triad we rebuilt our readiness we gave pay raises to our uniformed personnel we increased moral to the highest point in years we built m1 tanks the apache helicopter the patriot missile and ultimately we deployed all those systems all that readiness all those personnel in the war in the persian gulf in desert storm we had an overwhelming victory i think it was well stated we had an overwhelming victory in desert storm because we had forces that were far superior to our adversarys even though the press told us over and over again you are going up against the fourth largest army in the world and they kept waiting for saddam hussein to throw his best punch sometimes i think the press was waiting a little too anxiously he was never able to throw that punch because we had overwhelming forces we projected american military power like we had not projected it in 20 years and it was that rebuilding of that national defense that brought the soviet union to the bargaining table remember when we rebuilt our strategic triad building missiles building bomber aircraft when mr gorbachevwhen the soviet union went into westerneurope and started to ring the nations of our allies the french the british the germans started to put ss20s ballistic missiles close by those countries that were allies of the united states the united states said we are going to put groundlaunched cruise missiles and pershing missiles in europe facing you and we faced down the soviet union and the liberal press said now youve done it now ronald reagan youve gone too far and youre going to start a war or youre going to produce a split between the soviet union and the united states that will never heal a rift and well never have peace and yet we did those things we provided from a position of strength and lo and behold there was mr gorbachev on the phone saying can we talk about this and we talked about it in a series of arms control treaties that were unprecedented that vastly reduced and are reducing the exposure of american citizens to nuclear conflict we did all that because we were strong so in 1992 we got a new president a democrat president named bill clinton and president clinton put into effect one of the most radical cuts in national security in the history of this nation he cut 129 billion out of national defense and that was below the cuts that had already been made by colin powell and dick cheney now in cutting 129 billion out of national defense he is taking out army divisions from 18 to 10 taking our fighter wings from an equivalency of about 24 fighter wings to 14 we have gone down to last year when we only did 62 percent of the required depot level maintenancethat means fixing the equipment keeping it up to speedwe now have american men and women in uniform taking 27 million worth of food stamps because we are not keeping them up to speed with respect to their pay and this president is producing a hollow military and maybe it is appropriate that the only nation that he felt he could really face down this year was haiti because it really reflects all those situations that he was unable to face down situations like the korean peninsula where you have a real threat and let me go over just acouple of the statements that have been made concerning our military readiness under this president the army has stated this recruiters are finding mission achievement increasingly difficult and the marines note interest in joining has never been lower regarding quality of troops and recruits in 1989 100 percent of our recruits had high school diplomas in the first 6 months of 1994 this has already dropped to 94 percent the defense science board made a study

vermont has indicated that somehow the republican side was deficient because we allowed millionaires to spend their own money perhaps the gentleman from vermont does not realize that a little thing like the constitution stands in the way however the republicans in their bill do address the question of whether or not someone spending their own money can do so with limits being placed on their opponent what we do is remove those limits if in fact someone exercises their constitutional right to spend money i imagine a number of folks on the other side of the aisle will not let a little thing like the constitution stand in their way last night we had some amazing statements made on the floor the gentlewoman from california used the word hypocrisy it appears on page 10598 in i walked over to the dictionary here the random house dictionary of the english language second edition unabridged on page 943 it says hypocrisy a pretense of having some desirable or publicly approved attitude a pretense on the floor last night on page 10603 of the congressional record the speaker said we have promised to deal with this issue this year we should deal with it this year a pretense of having some desirable or publicly approved attitude we will not deal with this issue this year the bill that the democrats have put on the table cannot go into effect this year it cannot go into effect next year it cannot go into effect ever unless and until the democrats vote new revenue they have to vote new revenue or nothing in the bill goes into effect last night we heard the gentleman from connecticut we know in the sports scene today when we see two members jawing on the floor either in basketball or football they use the term trash talk the gentleman from connecticut i am sure did not realize but he was engaged in what i think we could only call trash talk last night when he getting a little carried away with his rhetoric indicated that tens of millions of dollars could be raised from political action committees under the republican proposal now i know his skin is a little thin when we use the term 1 million in talking about the democrats package but this is not coming from us if the members will look at the congressional quarterly on page 3091 for november 13 the headline by a very respected reporter around here who knows how to read bills the headline reads house will vote on limits nearing 1 million everybody knows the democrat package is a 1 million package i am going to talk about a number of issues in terms of the republican bill but i frankly wantto spend some time on the one section where apparently the democrats simplydo not understand how it works the democrats simply do not understand how it works the democrats have said over and over again that we have spending limits in our bill you dont have spending limits in your bill yes they have an arbitrary amount which is about 1 million applied to every district in the united states whether that district is a whole state whether the district is an urban district whether that district is a suburban or rural district it is an automatic artificial clampedon 1 million limit regardless of the kind of campaign they are able to run or the district they represent what the republicans have said is lets get hold of campaign spending who should we give it to who best who most properly should control the amount of money spent in a campaign guess who we came up with a radical new idea revolutionary maybe that is why it is so difficult for some of the democrats to understand the radical revolutionary idea that republicans offer in the michel substitute is that the people who vote in the election get to control how much money is spent in the campaign i have heard the democrats say gee we spend too much time trying to raise money of course they do why because they are never in their district they are in new york they are in hollywood they are in some other major urban center but never in their district the reason they are never in their district is there is no requirement that they have to raise money in their district in this bill they can spend s1 million and still do not have to raise any money in their district what the republicans say is before you can get a dime from a political action committee before you can get a dime from somewhere outside your district you have got to raise a dimein your own district democrats keep talking about 1 000 contributions we know who really is upset with the political system today it is the people who give 5 or 10 or 315 or 20 they do not count and they know they do not count guess why with the republican proposal if we are required to get 1 from our district before we can get 1 from anywhere else all of a sudden that guy who has 5 to offer is a lot more powerful we have to actually go home to our districts and work with those people before we can take pac money any pac money under our proposal let me tell the members we enable the small person we make the system work we reunite the voting precinct and the financial precinct the amount of money determined to be spent in the campaign is determined by the people back home not by some arbitrary limit slapped on by incumbents who want to make sure they are taken care of at the 1 million level it is the people back home who determine how much money is spent in the republican proposal i know democrats have a difficult time understanding that because it is so radical it seems to me that if we really listen to the public what they are complaining about is all the money brought in from the outside from all the big organizations what we say is get your money from back home guess what when we are taking the 5 or the 10 contribution we are taking it from someone who can vote in the election we do not need as much money if we are actually spending time in our districts talking to people in our districts i know that it is radical i know it is revolutionary i know they have a hard time understanding it but what we have here is an opportunist to really radically change elections to put the people who can vote in the drivers seat and to take a look at the suggestion that a majority of our money has to come from people who can actually vote in the election i reserve the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5138879716396332, 0.4861120283603668, 1, "first i want to respond to one thing the gentleman from new york said that i am sure even he would admit was mistaken if he thinks about it when he said this was mary poppins paternalism if it was anything it would have had to have been mary poppins maternalism i am sure the gentleman from new york on sober reflection would agree with me i want to talk about this terrible procedure we just heard about where an amendment that is the base text of the bill is offered why that is such an outrageous procedure that the last time i heard of it it was in the armed services bill on the question of gays in the military and it was supported by the republicans that we do it that way that was the amendment offered by the gentleman from missouri the fact is that this republican preference for open rules is the most occasional burning passion i have ever seen i have rarely seen people so intermittently zealously committed to a principle which they are prepared to abandon on alternate days of the week because i will tell you that during the past 12 years that i have been here i have fought against republicans time and again because i wanted amendments to tax bills and trade bills when we dealt with the question of fast track on nafta one of the great issues that drove this issue and the gentleman from michigan had an amendment that he wanted to make in order dealing with the terms under which nafta was debated the committee on rules would not let it happen and the overwhelming majority of the republicans were there voting with the committee on rules voting on the committee on rules to keep it out if people wanted a rule that we are always going to have open rules ok but let us not have this inc6nsistency masking itself as burning principle second let us talk about what would have happened if we had an open rule first of all i think the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania would have been out of order we have two arguments on the republican side first you are spending too much money on the independentcoun sel issue and second you are not spending nearly enough money on the independentcounsel issue because right now about 60 people are automatically covered because they are that close to the president than it is inconceivable to think that there would be objectivity with members of congress we said there may be a problem and there may not be and we will leave it up to the attorney general they would increase by a factor of 1 000 percent the number of people covered automatically it would go from 60 to 600 there are 60 of them and then there would be 550 of us let us assume that we are twice as honest as they are that would cost five times more if you assume we are half as honest as they are that would cost 20 times more because when you go from 60 covered people to 600 covered people you diamatically increase the cost i do not believe my friend from pennsylvania bad cbo score this i think he is in violation of the paygo because this will inevitably cost more money unless you are prepared to vouch for the insistence that no member of congress will ever again be investigated and i do no think so iwish but i do not think so so the fact is that we are talking about a rule which presents every important issue and i have been dealing with the independentcounsel statute as a member of the committee since i got here every important issue will be before the floor of the house why is it not a totally open rule in addition to trying to help out our friend the gentleman from pennsylvania you heard it here 10 amendments are in order 3 of them noncontroversial en bloc from the chairman 7 other amendments of some controversy and then they said 2 were turned down by this one and 2 from this one 7 from this one and 1 from that one there were 27 amendments offered take 27 amendments debate each one of them for a couple of hours have a rollcall and you do not get a bill in time and that might suit some people because on the whole the republican party has been trying to slow this bill down in fact in the senate 14 republicans including the assistant leader of the republicans in the senate the gentleman from wyoming voted to keep member coverage the way it is in the bryant amendment and the justification for having the bryant amendment and the gekas amendment this way is this it is to prevent the distortion that might come from people who would say people voting for the bryant position were against member coverage members are covered here there have been four republicans to be attorney general since the independentcounsel statute was adopted adopted by the way by democrats under a democratic president not ed meese not william french smith not richard thornburgh and not william barr no republican attorney general not one of the four republican attorneys general that served under the independentcounsel bill have used his unquestioned unchallenged authority to appoint an independent counsel any one of the four of them anytime a member of congress was accused of something could have invoked the independentcounsel provision they indicted republicans they indicted democrats they were not holding back that i can see after four republican attorneys general under two republican presidents consistently said we do not need the independentcounsel statute for members of congress i am hard pressed to believe wholly in the importance of making that drastic expensive change right now"], [0.5138331949710846, 0.4861668050289154, 1, "i take this time because i think that there has been an awful lot of bloviating on both sides of the crime issue and i want to confess frankly that i do not know how effective this crime bill will be all i know is that there has been a 6year effort on the part of people in both parties to try to find a way to attack what the american people see as one of the most pernicious problems facing this country and they would kind of like to think that we could put politics aside and do some things that are real i frankly am mystified by a lot of rhetoric associated with the debate the last week i hear for instance a good many of our friends on the republican side of the aisle and some on our own who suddenly have demonstrated a newfound interest in the costs associated with this bill and are saying that there is way too much money in this bill to fight crime i thought it would be a good idea to go back and look at the record i went back and i first of all looked at the first amendment that was offered by the committee chairman which raised spending above the amount recommended in the committee bill the en bloc amendment offered by the gentleman from texas it offered additional funding for a good many items 12 million for the establishment of boys and girls clubs 100 million for the establishment of community based justice grant programs et cetera et cetera i look at the vote on that amendment and i see 242 democrats voted for it and only 2 voted against it i see 147 republicans voted for it only 23 republicans voted against it i would ask the question if you do not like the money that is in this bill where were you and where were your votes when this amendment was adopted it was whooped through here with an overwhelming majority of both parties then we had the 10 billion amendment providing forfederal assistance to states for prison construction i see 170 republicans voted for it i see only one republican voted against it i see 205 democrats voted for it and only 49 voted against it again for those who have suddenly found a concern about the dollars in this bill i ask them where were they when they were whooping through amendments like that i did not vote to add that additional spending because i thought that states have their own bonding capacity my state is talking about cutting 1 billion in property taxes it seems to me we have a huge deficit i think it is a legitimate question about how much we can afford on that subject we had another amendment which provided for 6 000 additional border guards i see 224 democrats voted for it 12 voted against it one hundred and seventytwo republicans voted for it there were no nos that added a good amount of spending to the bill if you are concerned about spending in this bill where were you when amendments like that were added it seems to me it is pretty clear to me that the concern about spending is a latefound concern on the part of many people in this institution now we are told that we ought to take out all of the prevention money in the bill they call that a clean bill i call that a crazy bill if we were in the area of health care t6 only fund treatment and not fund prevention we would be literally laughed out of the political arena because our constituents understand that prevention is crucial in all fields there are those who laugh at midnight basketball i would suggest that any time that you can get kids off the street in the middle of the night and have them engaged in anything else including recreational activity it is a net positive public good and i make no apology for it you can laugh at job counseling that is in this bill if you want anybody who has ever dealt with youngsters with limited opportunities and limited understanding of how to get them ought to understand that there is no need to make an apology for those programs you can laugh if you want at the money provided in this bill to try to break up gangs but when you watch the gangs in my own hometown cruising the streets i do not think you are going to laugh quite as loud about that i really do not think so you can if you want laugh at the money in this bill to try to provide protection for women from domestic violence i do not happen to find that a laughing matter no woman who has ever been abused at home will find that a laughing matter either i would suggest that this bill may not be perfect it is farfrom perfect there are items in this bill i flatly and strongly disagree with but it is a consensus reached by 535 people from differing districts all over the country and the administrationnumerous people working hard on both sides of the political aisle believe it or not they are working according to the dictates of their conscience despite the cynicsin this chamber and out who would try to convince the public otherwise our choice today is to do something or to do nothing it seems to me after a 6year fight to put together an attack against crime we ought to pass this and move on i do not know how effective this is going to be because i suspect half the claims for this bill are overblown but i would suggest that i know that 90 percent of the claims addressed against this bill are cynical and political and we ought to dismiss them and do what we think is right for the country"], [0.5137409865856171, 0.48625901341438293, 1, "i couldnt wait to get over here because first of all it is interesting to see how many people on the other side got religion over the holidays and are suddenly for this bill with all this gray hair i remember back even when we had this bill up before this was not a good idea so that is the first part but now i walk in on this debate where they are attacking the other gentleman from texas as being soft on congress the gentleman from texas is the one who in both cloakrooms usually 24 hours on day everybody is beating up on because i know johnny bryant if there is one thing he is not it is soft on congress this is the man who has been leading all sorts of reforms out there that members love to hate sometimes but to accuse him of being soft on congress in this bill it is really bard to keep from giggling as i hear it it doesnt pass the giggle test i guess is what i am trying to say now let us talk about some of these things yes indeed the bryant amendment puts members of congress explicitly under the independent counsel law it does that unfortunately there is no truth in political debate we have got the truth in advertising so one can say things about toothpaste and they better be true or one can sue but on political debate one can say anything about a bill and it does not have to be true but let me say the bryant amendment and anybody who knows his background knows that this would not be an oversight he allows the attorney general to invoke the independent counsel law this is appropriate discretion there are unitedstates attorneys all over america that can move out and go after members of congress in a vigorous way and have done so if there have been unitedstates attorneys that have been shy in doing this i want to know who they are i cannot think of any that have been intimidated by this nor can i think of any attorney generals that have been intimidated by this i really see this as kind of a delaying tactic there are different rules sometimes for congress unfortunately that came out of the constitution there are many of us trying to change that separate branches of government are not allowed to police the other branch we cannot go over to the court across the street and start telling them how to run their personnel system and they are not supposed to come over here and we are not supposed to go to the executive branch and they are not pupposed to come over there so we have toset up our own policing systems and we have been trying to do that and we have got to put more and more teeth in it believe me their is no one around here that wants more teeth in these things than i do excongresswoman lynn martin and i used to run around with a bill here all the time trying to get members on it trying to get them moving on house fair employment practices and other such things members would always run for the door a lot of the members who give speeches i must say as i have been listening to this debate i have found it a little humorous i think the real trick is to look at the bill and why it is needed i salute the gentleman from texas and how hard he has worked on this if members look at watergate and i an old enough and have been around here long enough to remember watergate this got started because archibald cox got interfered with he had all of that turbulence all of that commotion i am pleased the other side now agrees that we need this even though we let it run out because we could not get the votes in the last house session oh goodness it looks like we are going to get the votes now but let us move on and let us get this going let us get this independent counsel out there so that there can be these investigations members are covered yes we can also be covered by the unitedstates attorneys yes we are covered by the unitedstates house committee on standards of official conduct which has not been shy either and the house committee on standards of official conduct cannot try the supreme court and it cannot try members of the executive and they have their ethics and they do not try us that is they there are different things now i know we are not under osha we are bringing in every dead cat we can think of we are not under osha we are not under this we are not under that well we should be i agree we should be but that is not the issue here the issue here is how does the independent counsel bill work visavis members of congress it gives many many bites out of the apple i think it says that members of congress are going to be as vigorously pursued as anybody else and probably much more so and believe me if somebody had some real concrete ideas to be even more so i am sure the gentleman from texas would take them because the one thing he has been in the forefront of is trying to make this place absolutely squeeky clean and to rebuild this institution and to rebuild the

going to do any good i do not know as i understand it the debate that has what it is going to cost gone on here we are trying to stop the i have those same concerns on the sins of the past there is no question other side i also feel that the real we asked for a huge amount of infor problem needs to be solved at the bormation from school districts today der not in the field of education school lunch programs and others we i have a real hard time with it but are also working overtime with school as was discussed a minute ago govdistricts to try to reduce that paper ernor wilson has asked for 3 7 billion work to reduce those costs so we can because of the illegal immigration imtake that money and put it into pact it is a federal mandate we manlunches or services or teaching date on the states that they pay for it we cannot just say because we are just like we are trying to legislate that already doing that we can just add a we mandate apayment to cover the little bit more i think that is the pur cost of this paperwork pose of the debate that is going on the problem is 3 7 billion a year if here we can stop illegal immigration we do from this reauthorization which has not have to worry about doing it here been 5 years since we have done it if in the field of education we can take members do not want unfunded man 3 7 billion and apply it to those areas dates then they have to come up with into education and law enforcement ways to provide that funding we can and rest of it by stopping it at the bornot just say this is additive we are der i think that is the real area that we need to take a look at i want to stop all illegal immigration coming in whether it is the chinese boat people whether it is the irish which i am a member of or whether it is across the border of mexico the only way to do that i think is to stop totally those services but that should not rest in the education field however all the other areas law enforcement where we have as the gentleman from indiana said about 25 percent it is actually about 132 percent of our felons are illegal aliens but we do not fund that we know that number it is a hard number and we can ask the government for funds in the field of afdc we know that number and we can do it but in the field of education when the state asks for help because of the impact just like impact aid in military when the state asks for the numbers of illegals so that we can get the funding out of the federal government for that impact on the states we cannot give them an accurate number my problem with the rohrabacher amendment one it is an unfunded mandate which i would like to see it funded but we cannot appropriate it unless we authorize it first or they will call for a point of order later on so it is darned if you do and darned if you dont the whole point is my wife is a principal we take a birth certificate we take an address and we take a phone number and we do not ask the kids the parents fill that out when the parent fills that out you put block no 4 on there are you a legal resident of the united states that does not take a whole lot of paperwork or a whole lot of dollars to do you cannot use that information by law with the ins so you cannot verify it i do not know if it is going to do any good or not that is what my problem is on both sides of this trying to weigh in my own mind whether it is a good thing to do i do not know if we are going to get accurate funds but i think we need to stand up in all the committees and make a point first of all we are dealing with illegal immigrationillegal immigration that impacts us 2 billion across the united states we can do a lot with that money if we stop that type of immigration we are going to not only help taxpayers but we are going to help the programs that we are so deficient in the money in education in law enforcement in health care and the rest of it the perfecting amendment i would hope that the members would support the gentleman from california has 600 new border patrolmen at the border they have lights they have roads that is where we need to stop illegal immigration my friend the gentleman from california and i will sit down and talk they will support those kinds of initiatives do we do it in education the second amendment of the gentleman from california i oppose why because he is going to ask that the federal government not give the schools money but yet the school counts it by the number of faces there and if they do not get the number of faces there they cannot get the money again governor wilson is going to have to pay for it

last night who asked me the question that i get over and over ever since i announced last january that i intended to devote full time to the committee this year and not seek reelection so that i would do a half a job at each of them that the most common question i get is are you sorry you are leaving or are you glad you are leaving it is put one of the two ways and once before i had an experience like this in leaving government service at the end of world war ii the way we were let out so that we did not all 11 million come home at one time and flood everything was by a point systern and points were awarded to you by your service and once you knew that you were getting close to your points you knew you were on your way home and the closer you got to the points the more exciting it got because you knew you were going to get out you were going to be doing something different you were going to be doing something with the rest of your life but there wasalways a sadness that went with that because as you got closer to the day ofdischarge you thought more and more about what is going to happen to the friends i leave behind oh how nice it would be to stay with them and r have that same sort of feeling 50 years later as i leave federal service for the second time in my life that i will miss the friends that i have made and the friends who have left before me many of them now deceased but a person who comes to this place no mr tte what is said about it by anyone else is blessed not only by the opportunity to serve and the opportunity to do things and to form a little part of our country the way you would like it to be formed but more than that you are blessed with an opportunity to work with the finest people with whom you are ever going to come in contact in any occupation now that may not mean much to my friend bill the schoolteacher because i am a lawyer and compared to associating with lawyers i am sure he feels that almost anything would be an improvement

of them as a lawyer i kind of resent it when i hear people speaking disparagingly of the congress and i believe i will until the day i die because serving here has been in my mind the highest calling

after putting me in college raised my sights to the point where i actually had uncle sams help to become a lawyer that may not seem like much but i grew up without ever having talked to a lawyer or being introduced to a lawyer or in fact seeing one anyplace except the movies the only collegeeducated people that i knew as a child growing up none in my family but the collegeeducated people i came in contact with are the people to whom i probably owe the most of all of the people i have come in contact with and that was my schoolteachers starting right out in the first grade and going all the way through the people that i can remember that have made the most difference to me are teachers and i get my greatest satisfaction anytime that i can encourage a young person to consider education as

facing a serious problem that it just shatters the walls of party labels i do not know when it happened or where i was when it happened but somehow the crisis as it relates to drug addiction and the problems that occur when we ignore it it seems as though somewhere the war has been won or it has gone away or that certainly no part of the congress is prepared to deal with it oh we talk about violence we talk about crime we talk about our health bill but if you talk about all of those things why do you not stop and think why are we having so much crime seventy percent of the people in those jails are there because of drug addiction wlby are we having so much hemorrhage in our health bills because most of the people that are in these hospitals are in there with gunshot wounds addiction children being born addicted to drugs paying 5 000 to 7 000 a day for each and every one of these cases yet when someone comes and says can we help do something about it and they come to the congress you see what we have done some of us republicans and democrats have worked around the clock working with this administration and not just this one whether it was nixon or whether it was carter or whether it was ford or whether it was reagan we tried to work together not as democrats and not as republicans but if we are having a war against crime why are we cutting back on the fbi and the drug enforcement administration why is it every time we turn around to fight the war we cannot get the bullets and the ammunition now all of a sudden we are asking for 152 million we are asking for it because if there is anyone that has been involved in the war against drugs it has been our friends in colombia the days are over now when they used to point their fingers at us and say the reason why the cocaine is thriving the reason why the opium crops are thriving the reason why marijuana is thriving is because of american demand no it is more serious than that now as an effort of the partnerships that the united states has made with the organization of american states they have seen that drug addiction and drug trafficking have threatened the fragile democracies that we have in this hemisphere and at a time when things are beginning to work at a time when they are asking us to continue to assist them so that we cannot just depend on the elimination of the crops that will never never happen unless we reduce consumption but we have to fight it in education and you cannot name one program that is designed in education to prevent our kids from going on drugs we have to do something about rehabilitation and not one of you know of a federal program that supports it that can effectively say they rehabilitate our kids we have to do something about crime and what do we do three strikes and you are out mandatory sentences executions is that stopping crime is that stopping drug addiction there is no border between burma and thailand as we see the heroin pouring into these united states and what are they doing in districts throughout this country they are giving away the heroin on the street so our children will become addicted to it and what are they asking for 152 million what do we lose every year as a result of doing nothing with drugs 500 billion when you take into consideration how many people we lock up how many people we keep in the hospitals how much we lose in productivity i am not saying that we can win this war but if you ask for 152 million for the international narcotic force in the state department it was not republicans who asked for it it was not democrats who asked for it it was the president of these united states asking that our credibility abroad be kept intact and where do we ask to take it away from we ask to take it away from the soviet union now i do not know how any of you feel about communists and maybe you forget quickly but i fought against the communists and i have to say if they can redeem themselves for 52 million why not give the 52 million to the communities that never were communist in the first place they are asking for the same hopes the same aspirations as the former soviet union they are out of work they are out of hope they are relying on drugs why can we not say america first it is a simple thing to me now i know that as a democrat i am going against the rules we are not supposed to ever defeat the previous question but then i have to decide what is more important the previous question the democratic tradition or the millions of kids that can honestly say that this country and this congress has not done a darn thing to allow them to believe that we ever can do it right i ask my democratic friends to look at this when the previous question is defeated we are not turning the bill over to the republicans we are just asking for one amendment this is not breaking any budget if some of your constituents are supporting the soviet union and it is going to defeat you at the polls then believe me you are excused but if on the other hand you believe that the money is better spent keeping these drugs out of your districts i ask you to defeat the previous question let the rule come back with this one sole amendment and let us get on with the peoples business"], [0.5131254494190216, 0.4868745505809784, 1, "i rise in opposition to this closed rule and i rise in opposition to the bill s 455 now i must say that i am responsible for part of the problem in terms of the timing of this bill i we had held up consideration of it based on many of the faults and problems that were demonstrated during the hearings with this bill that we held in the last two congresses earlier this year we had a hearing i pointed out that the public lands the public lands council commission that was designated in the 1970s pointed outin the 1980s pointed out what the prdblems were with the bill that there are 11 different programs that raised revenue off the federal lands for mining and timber and other programs that return revenues to local and state government and this bill notwithstanding the fact that you raise such revenue notwithstanding the fact that such revenue goes back and many counties receive significant amounts of money from that source makes no differential between those counties that raised small amounts of money and those that raised large amounts of money this bill there is no response to that on the part of the sponsors finally of course as the time is slip ping away we tried to provide for a temporary increase for 2 years that would put the counties and put the local governments that have these large public lands within their areas their states in the same position that this bill would that amendment is permitted under the rule with only 20 minutes of debate it is permitted under the rule but the difference in my amendment is that it would be a temporary increase for 2 years to alleviate or to address the problem whether we come back and take another look at that particular proposal but we cannot do that we cannot adopt that namendment the advocates of this say because it might go back to the senate and we know what happens in the senate in the senate we got a single senator that canveto a bill it is a new power it is one they invented and irri gated unto themselves that is not in the rules of the house or the senate that is not in the constitution but that is the way they intend to operate nevertheless it seems like we are sending many things back but for some reason this bill cannot go back we cannot adopt the amendment that is going to be proposed that would limit the costofliving increase the inflation adjustment in this that would go on forever in per petuity we cannot address that because it might go back to the senate and one senator might object again with the newfound rules that have locked the senate into a position where it cannot do anything that some members in this house apparently or others do not want them to do i have sought to offer additional amendments we are not trying to delay the bill we thought when the bill came out of committee that we would have a fair opportunity on the floor because we know in the committee with the members from the west the members that are the big beneficiaries of this bill could not would not listen to reason or accept amendmentq they were operating under this goal of get it out at all expense and pass it without any modifications we thought we would have a shot on the floor but the third amendment we wanted to offer is i thought was a reasonable one would not have delayed the bill it simply would have said that we would not have had to pay payment in lieu of taxes on federal lands that have been given to the state and sold to the private sector this bill provides that we will continue to pay payment in lieu of taxes on lands that are private lands that already are paying property tax do we need an adjustment the president says we need an adjustment did he mean that we need a 150 percent increase as my colleagues know it is not the 1970s anymore today we have got a 4 4 trillion deficit in the 1970s we had revenue sharing we had other programs were helping other municipalities and individuals across this country it is not the 1970s anymore this bill will increase spending by a half a billion dollars in just the first 4 years of the existence of this particular bill i suggest this rule because of its restrictionsi respect this bill because ofbecause of those shortfalls this bill should be defeated this bill deserves to be closely analyzed and reviewed by the house as my colleagues know those members that have voted in this body we voted for budgets and we are doing a good job in terms of making progress on the budget but this will be added in the discretionary spending authorization and let me assure the members that this becomes a no 1 priority for those 11 western states that are the major beneficiaries in terms of this bill they are going to become the no 1 the no 1 priority in terms of what happens in terms of the interior appropriations bill and the may just be an authorization in the minds and hearts of some of the members that may be voting for it but believe me these are authorizations that are going to turn into dollars in terms of our counterparts in the senate and the members in the house that are advocating this will be their no 1 priority i suggest they need an inflation adjustment but i think it ought to be done in the context of reform it ought not to be done in a vacuum it ought not to be done with a rule that is unfair that does not permit the proper debate and consideration in an orderly manner for this subject on the floor today and tomorrow mr speaker"], [0.5131131708621979, 0.4868868291378021, 1, "as i ponder the presidents possible remarks later this evening on the state of the union i thought it was important to discuss some things that address what i believe will be the principal subject of the presidents remarks i am happy that several of my colleagues who preceded me on the microphone today have seen fit to address some of these issues it seems to me and what i read in the paper suggests that the president will deal principally with the issue of crime in america the reform of our health care system and welfare reform i wonder if we in the congress have the collective courage the strength and the statesmanship to rededicate ourselves to true reform for true reform is what is necessary some of the problems that principally beset us are crime health care and welfare reform these are problems that concern all americans any poll that is taken indicates that these are the principal issues concerns and worries in the hearts and in the minds of the american people as the gentleman from texas who immediately preceded me to the microphone indicated it depends on how you look at the statistics as to what they show you the statistics recently released by the federal bureau of investigation show that americas crime rate for the last 2 years actually declined by 5 percent the last 2 years was the only period in the last 50 years in which the congress of the united states did not pass a crime bill so one could say that during the 2year period when congress did not pass a crime bill was the only time in the last 50 years when the crime rate went down so if we really want the crime rate to go down we need to stop the congress from passing crime bills because most of what they are used for is re election of members of congress most of what the crime bills are used for is the reelection of the members of congress they make wonderful commercials they look good on your resume they are wonderful for television where you can show yourself slamming the bars on some prison but you fail to tell the citizens out there who are going to vote for you how much you are costing them some of my friends are in favor of the lock them up and throw the key away approach some of my friends are in favor of assisting the states by building regional prisons but if my friend who immediately preceded me to the microphone would have his way the gentleman from texas we would require the states to impose upon their court system the requirement that 85 percent of a sentence be served we are not going to pay for it the states are going to have to pay for it and in these days when most of us are speaking about unfunded mandates here is another mandate now we really do need to do something about crime but the states can do much more about crime than the federal government and i do not think they need our help what we like to help them do is to run over each other getting to a microphone so we can tell the citizens how much we have done to protect them how much we have done about crime so that we can get reelected statistics of whether crime has decreased mean absolutely nothing as i say in the last 2 years crime has decreased by 5 percent according to fbi statistics but i dont know any people who are comforted by that because they are still afraid to walk the streets in the daytime and at night now they are afraid to go to the shopping malls they are afraid to ride on the public transportation systems they are afraid to send their children to school yet they are being told by the fbi that the crime statistics have gone down in the last 2 years by 5 percent i do not know any people anywhere in america who are not afraid or have an allpermeating fear of driveby shootings and random violence and children being caught in the crossfire of automatic and semiautomatic weapons the increase in the sale of burglar alarms and personal defense devices will tell us that people are afraid people want something done about crime but they are tired of paying to have something done about crime that does not do anything about crime they have been paying out of the nose they have been paying out of the pocket they have been paying out of the ears been paying out of everywhere that they can pay for the last 50 years of congress to come up and engage in an exercise in futility because we are not solving the problem if every violent criminal in america today were locked up and put in prison we would be safe for a little while however because we do not do anything about the people who are 17 and 16 and 15 and 14 and 13 if we locked up everybody that was over 17 who committed a violent crime for the rest of their life and we do nothing more than what we are doing now for the people who are 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 and 16 and 17 in 2 years or 3 years or 4 years we will be right back where we started except we will have a whole lot more prisons built these prisons are not cheap the average cost to build one cell in which two or three or four persons may be housed is 100 000 it costs us 100 000 each time we build another maximum security cell in which we can lock up these violent criminals a lot of them need to be locked up that is not the point of my discussion here today in addition to that 100 000 to build this house in which we can house up to four of these individuals we pay the princely sum of 25 000 per year for every year they are locked up for the rest of their lives so if we take somebody who is 20 who is going to die when he is 70 we are going to spend 50 years at 25 000 keeping that person locked up in prison they do not even have to pay for their own keep we want to do something about crime we are afraid there is at least a perception that crime has gone out of control crime is hemorrhaging our country to the tune of 470 billion per year we must have a response the present response is not working the other body has passed a crime bill in which they were able to find 22 billion to pay for prisons when just last year in the same year when they found 22 billion to pay for prisons they could not find 10 billion to pay for head start healthy start and summer jobs for some of the same people who are now incarcerated in prison since june 1993 the chairman the gentleman from michigan john conyers the gentleman from virginia robert scour the gentleman from north carolina mel watr the gentleman from california xavier becerra the gentleman from california don edwards and i along with many other members of various interest groups and caucuses organizations and groups have been crafting and drafting a realistic humanistic doable approach to the problem of crime in america in the past these crime bills have usually been simply ways of increasing various ways to execute people limiting the constitutional rights of individuals who are charged with crimes establishing mandatory minimum sentences that federal judges say impose upon them a duty to act as a robot rather than as an individual and building more prisons we have been good at all of those things in the last 50 years we have built a lot more prisons we have established a lot more mandatory minimum sentences for people to serve we have abridged or suspended the constitutional rights of people who have engaged in criminal activity and we have found new ways and better ways of executing other human beings crime of course in these 50 years has not decreased as a result of these various pieces of legislation because as i noted the only 2year period in the last 60 years when we have not had a crime bill was the only 2year period in the last 50 years when crime has actually gone down what then is the purpose of the congress passing all of these crime bills the citizens want to know crime has not decreased as a result of the passage of this legislation nor will it ever be totally eradicated as a result of legislation i think it is time for a radically different approach to ensure that our constitutional rights are protected to reduce recidivism in our nations prisons to ensure that our nations schools are safe and our neighborhoods are safe and to save a generation of mostly poor people who wallow in an endless cycle of despair hopelessness and pessimism as the members may know members of the house of representatives and of the other body will take up the complex issue of crime this year several bills are currently on the table for consideration most notably the senate version of h r 3355 the house version of the same bill and h r 3315 the crime prevention and criminal justice reform act of 1993 anticrime policies of the past 40 years have been a series of quick cheap fixes new prisons were built mandatory minimums were imposed constitutional protections have been eroded in the name of public safety meanwhile our economic and social programs that could have quickly brought crime down have been largely ignored we have not created new educational opportunities for our people we have not created new jobs for our people and as a result we have increased and included more affordable prison space for our people although this bill 3356 was introduced as the criminal justice reform act our goal today is to enter into a scientific analysis of the solution to crime in america how should we spend whatever money we are going to spend on crime in america what are we going to get for the 22 billion that the other body wants to spend what alternatives exist to spending 22 billion and at the end of the spending of the 22 billion have more people incarcerated and more people needing to be incarcerated right now 25 percent of all africanamericans in this country are under the auspices of the criminal justice system twentyfive percent one in four black males between the age of 17 and 35 are either in prison or on probation or on parole having been to prison that is an alarming statistic we must look at the alternatives because it is clear that what we have been trying for the last 50 years has not been of benefit to any of our communities we are afraid of each other we do not face each other on the sidewalk and on the trains we will not look at each other on the metro because we do not know who is the next criminal who is going to take out an ak47 or an uzi and start shooting people that he does not know just because he has a gun in the true spirit of cooperation and comity we are willing and sincerely desire to work with all other members of the house of representatives and of the other body groups and individuals to make into fruition the most effective piece of legislation for the reduction of crime it recognizes if we lock all the people who are currently committing crime up but we do not go to the neighborhoods where we can almost point we cannot name the child by name but we can name the neighborhoods from which they will come we can name the streets upon which they will be raised we can name the schools that they are going to drop out of we can name them almost by name they are 4 5 and 6 years old now ten years from now they will be 14 15 and 16 years old if society does not intervene in their lives in a meaningful way in the next 10 years they will go to prison if society has its way or some of societys members in this congress have their way they will stay in prison perhaps for the rest of their lives and the subject of my discussion is not whether they should go to prison or whether they should stay in prison for the rest of their lives it is whether we should have to pay for it whether we should have to pay 100 000 to build a cell that will house up to four people and then 25 000 per year in todays costs lord knows what it is going to be with the inflation rate in future years for the next 50 years to lock somebody up in prison when we could have prevented it we can spend onetenth of that amount per year for 10 years we can spend 1 years cost of incarcerating an individual at 25 000 a year and spend 2 500 a year on these children when they are 4 5 and 6 years old and avoid the necessity of spending 25 000 per year on them when they get 14 15 and 16 years old that to me makes a lot of sense it makes a lot of sense to recognize that we are going to have to get at the root causes of what produces people who turn out to be criminals in our society we know a lot of the reasons already that is not to coddle them or excuse away their conduct they have been engaged in antisocial behavior every child who grows up poor does not turn out to be a criminal most of them do not we seem to have enough social scientists enough behavioral scientists and enough people like that to be able to go in and look and say 10 children grew up on this street in the 1960s they were all born in this neighborhood they were all about the same age they played together on the playground they went to the same elementary school together why is it that two of them turned to a life of crime and have committed offense after offense after offense and why is it that two of them are now locked up in prison for the rest of their lives why is it that 1 out of 10 turn out to be a successful doctor contributing to the community why is it that another turns out to be a nurse or a nurse practitioner or a janitor or a mechanic or a person who makes a contribution to our society in one way or another and it does not matter what they are doing they are not commiting crimes they are teaching other people they are leading other people by example they have become productive members of their community we ought to be able to find the difference between the ones that go to prison and the ones who do not and we need to know what those differences are because we need to start spending our money wisely and we need to start spending our money carefully because the days are gone when the unitedstates government was a bottomless pit into which it could stick its hands to pull out money to pay for all of these programs the days are gone when we are going to be able to throw money at the problem no matter what we think the solution is no matter whether we think the solution is going to work those days are gone the taxpayers are watching the expenditures of their dollars carefully it seems to me that we ought to give them a dollars worth of thought for a dollars worth of their money and no thought has gone into these crime bills that are being circulated around here there is nothing in there for the american who wants to worry about not only being safe today but being safe tomorrow these politicians would have you think that if we locked up all of the violent criminals then you can take the burglar bars off your house and you can go in the safeway or the convenient store late at night and not be worried about walking in in the middle of a robbery or you can park at the ballgame and not worry about whether your car is going to be there when you get back or you can get on the subway and notbe worried about being the victim of a random ak47 shooting or you can stand on the street corner and talk to your friends and neighbors and not worry about being the victim of a driveby shooting but you know better you know when this 22 billion is spent the congress will be back after 22 billion more after that and then another 50 billion more and then 100 billion more there is no end to how much they would make you pay to solve crime in america but ask yourselves mr and mrs america of the 2 6 trillion you spent on crime in the last 40 years what have you gotten for your money you have elected a lot of politicians who have made a lot of 30second commercials where they get up with the red white and blue flag behind them and tell you how by god how tough they are onthese criminals and they want to lock them up and throw the key away with your money they want to lock them up all right with your money what will they use for a commercial if they lock them all up and there are no more criminals they will have something else to run on they cannot run on communism anymore because we do not have that bugaboo crime is the thing that they use to strike fear in your heart so that they can get reelected make them think make them come to the table next time they have a townhall meeting and get up and tell you how they are going so much for you about solving crime just ask them mr congressman mr congressman if we spend this 22 billion on crime can you assure me mr congressman that crime is going to go down in america can you assure me can you promise me do you hold out any hope that that chart that keeps going up like this when we spend this 22 billion that you are going to make us spend will drop just an iota just go down 1 percent or onetenth of 1 percent mr congressman will there be less murders in america next year when we pass these new laws that you are telling us about when we lock all of these people up in prison congressman will that mean that my car will not get stolen that i will not get carjacked i will not be the victim of a driveby shooting congressman and the honest answer is no this is not going to do any good because we are spending a lot of the money on the back end of the factory that turns these young people out on our streets we are not putting any money in on the front end we know that 97 percent of the people in prison are high school dropouts hello ninetyseven percent of the people who end up in prison are high school dropouts now all high school dropouts do not end up in prison but a disproportionately high number as opposed to college graduates or high school graduates or trade school graduates end up in prison now it does not take a rocket scientist which i am not to figure out that there is some connection between lack of education and prison when 97 percent of the people who are in prison quitschool at the seventh or eighth grade it seem to me that if we could find a way just to go back to the sixth grade and keep youngsters in the seventh grade the eighth grade and the ninth grade we would be cutting down on the number of people we have to spend 25 000 a year apiece on to go to prison there is an alternative that needs to be made a part of the discussion and it is the crime bill about which i spoke earlier what does this crime bill do that other bills do not do first it does away with mandatory minimum sentences for crimes this would allow for more discretion in the hands of our judges and juries to determine what is the proper sentence for the crime that was committed every person who commits the same crime should not receive the same sentence we ought to be able a judge ought to be able to look into an individuals background and say this person has not ever committed a crime before or this person has good family support or this person has gotten a ged and college credits while they are in prison the recidivism rate for people who get a college education or at least 2 years of college training while they are in prison the rate at which they go back to prison is onetenth that for people who do not get any training while they are in prison the rate of those individuals who receive drug counseling while they are in prison is half of what it is for people who do not receive any drug counseling when they are in prison the bill that i am talking about also strengthens the habeas corpus guidelines for prisoners so that a person gets one fair shot one good trial and if they are convicted then we give them a fair trial before we hang them it has no new death penalties in it because death penalties do not do any thing but stop that individual it is a legalized way for the state to engage in murder of its citizens it allows for one demand drug treatment for all prisoners the crisis of drugs in our communities needs to be dealt with as a health care crisis because that is what it is it is not a criminal justice problem it is a health care problem if someone needs treatment for a disease we should be able to provide that treatment whether they are in prison or out of prison the bill also allows for afterrelease counseling and guidance for exoffenders this provision will help those who have paid their debt to society to become better incorporated into the mainstream of society it puts more police officers on the streets it bans 21 types of assault weapons it imposes a tax on ammunition it requires higher standards in order to become a gun dealer rather than paying alcohol tobacco and firearms a 25 fee and becoming magically a gun dealer it allows for the victims of crime to be recompensed for their losses and strengthens provisions for crimes against women it is the goal of this bill that through hard work and working with other members and in comity and conversation with members of this body both republican and democrat and a combination of legislative efforts community spirit and individual courage and responsibility we can significantly decrease the incidence of crime in our homes in our neighborhoods in our schools in our communities and in our wonderful country in the end no one solution will work no one bill is going to be a magic panacea to solving the problem of crime in america there are no cheap easy solutions nor quick solutions available on the horizon but the tremendous costs of crime in our community as stated earlier estimated by business week magazine to be more than 470 billion each year demands that we not give up our countrys great wealth surely can be harnessed in an effective way to provide the remedies that would allow people to walk the streets without fear we need to seriously consider alternatives that prevent individuals from becoming criminals in the first place rather than to spend all of our money punishing them once they become criminals there is no way to end that pipeline there are more people in this country who are 2 years old than there were 15 years ago there are more people who are 3 years old there are more people who are 4 years old if we do not attend to assuring that we provide the means by which we prevent these individuals from becoming criminals 10 years from now then we are looking in the wrong place for a solution to the wrong problem i think that the president will also address the question of health care in america this evening when he addresses our nation in this state of the union address health care reform is perhaps the biggest political issue of our time most of the public response to the idea of healthcare reform is reminiscent to the way most of us feel about our doctors when they begin spouting those doctor words that they know that jargon that only doctors learn when they go to medical school we trust they know what they are talking about and at the end of the day that they do no harm what is needed in order to solve the healthcare dilemma that we have in our country where 37 million of our people have no form of health care whatsoever is a wideopen farranging public debate about the deeper issues of health care than just the superficial issues that we are talking about we need to discuss our attitudes towards life and death we need to discuss the goals of medicine in our country we need to discuss the meaning of health we need to discuss the concept of suffering versus the concept of survival we need to discuss who shall live and who shall die and who shall decide who shall live and who shall die in our country we must discuss these issues but they have been currently supplanted by the rather narrow quibble over policy the parodox of our current situation does require that we discuss policy however unless we address such basic existential and fundamental questions as those i have raised a moment ago we stand little chance of solving our nations healthcare crisis because 25 years ago 7 6 percent of our gross domestic product was devoted to health 6 8 percent to education 9 7 percent to defense today defense and education consume approximately 6 percent each and health expenditures have climbed to 14 percent and will reach 18 percent by the year 2000 most of the policymakers here in washington have been focusing on the deficiencies and failures of modern medicine they claim it is either greedy pharmaceutical companies or greedy insurance companies or unnecessary procedures or bureaucratic inefficiency and paperwork or expensive technologies and so forth these discussions have taken control of the debate and these ideas seemingly have taken over the clinton administrations debate over health care the administration seems to see the solutions to our healthcare crisis in terms of improving the efficiency of the system without looking at the underpinnings that identify their approach including managed care and those are the buzzwords for their program such as managed care hmos and managed competition implicit in these recommendations is the assumption that the elimination of waste will obviate the need for rationing health care most americans know that we already ration health care we do it on the basis of wealth we do it on the basis of geography we do it on the basis of circumstances beyond the control of the individual for if a person is wealthy then they have as much health care as they can afford in this country if a person is poor all too often it is necessary for them to sleep on the floors of our public and charity hospitals for days on end before they receive the rationing that we call our healthcare system healthcare delivery in our system our groups that are opposed to the presidents plan who feel the government should take the predominant role in the health care of its people argue on behalf of a different approach people ask how nations such as england and canada can provide health care comparable to ours for much less money first of all england and canada use the singlepayer payment system that is the government pays for everyones health care directly and this system is an option though highly efficient that has been met with tremendous opposition in this country medical costs will bankrupt this country if we continue on the current trajectory there are no data to demonstrate that improved management techniques will solve the problem managed care and managed competition save money in the short run although examples of other managed care managed industry do not inspire much confidence the utilities are an example of a managed industry and the airlines are another example of a managed industry our recent history will teach us that we should not place all of our confidence in a managed industry purely for that purpose but the bulk of the savings achieved by the health maintenance organizations has been achieved by cutting back on expensive unprofitable facilities such as burn centers traumacare centers neonatal intensive care units and emergency rooms and the like hmos conduct what amounts to a hidden form of healthcare rationing confident in the knowledge that the cities counties and charitable organizations and the university hospitals are still around to pick up the slack where they do not treat burns and neonatal intensivecare patients in emergency rooms as the managers of hmos know only too well the surest way to contain healthcare spending is to limit access to health care and to rethink our ever expanding concept of health if we must have allocation the process should require open discussion such as what we are doing here today and what we will be doing in the days weeks and months ahead when we are rationing life itself the decision must be subjected to public scrutiny and debate the first step is to set limits on health care according to the principles of equity and justice for all of our people we can no longer leave to the marketplace decisions about access to medical care we do not want kidneys to be sold to the highest bidder yet we tolerate something close to that right now when it is necessary although disgraceful for a patient to have to advertise for a liver on oprah while the governor of pennsylvania rushes to the head of the line to receive a new heart and liver transplant something is wrong with the way we ration health care in our country i do not begrudge the governor of pennsylvania the opportunity for a heart and liver transplant it saved his life but there were other people on the list for heart transplants and liver transplants long before it became necessary medically or even known medically that the governor would need such a procedure access then to our scarce healthcare resources must be organized along some equitable lines i do not suggest that these are easy decisions they are never easy decisions they force us to face our own mortality and demand that we look beyond our own sympathies and interests to look to see what is in the greater good of our country the ethical dilemmas do not end with access to scarce service or technology now come the trickier questions of deciding if and when that access should end most americans spend the bulk of their healthcare resources in the last 3 years of their lives most of the money that americans spend on health care is spent in the last 3 years of their lives how then do we make those choices i believe that some of the goals of any fair and just healthcare system are the universal access to health care for all people the quality of assurance in the healthcare delivery system health promotion and disease prevention education and training of a diverse body of healthcare providers and cost containment i have arrived at these goals as a result of several townhall meetings in my district as well as interfacing with constituents who are both lay people and physicians alike and they tell me together with my independent research that these are worthwhile goals and more imporantly obtainable goals under the health security act as proposed by the president most people and i underline the word most would obtain healthcare insurance through one of two entities either a local health alliance or a corporate alliance where available exceptions would be made for current medical care recipients military personnel veterans and native americans who would continue to be covered under their existing programs undocumented immigrants would not be covered under any program and i think that is a shame we would run the risk of not providing health care for undocumented workers by exposing ourselves to the risk of harm of diseases that they will catch and transmit for lack of medical resources being made available to them when i was growing up that was called pennywise and pound foolish but let me get back to the presidents plan two basic types of plans would exist a lowcostsharing hmqtype plan and a highcost combination called preferredprovider style employers would pay 80 percent of the premiums for fulltime workers and the worker would pay the remaining 20 percent employers would pay a smaller percentage for the cost of parttime workers depending on how many hours per week they actually work most lowincome workers and the unemployed have their share of insurance premiums at least partially subsidized by the government deductibles and copayments would vary depending upon the type of plan selected by the beneficiaries hmos would typically have a 10 copayment for doctors fees and a 5 copay for prescription drugs feeforservice plans would have a 20 percent copayment for doctors fees and hospital visits as well feeforservice plans would have a 200perperson and a 400perfamily deductible combination plans would have a low copayment if you are treated by a preferredprovider doctor or hospital and a higher copayment if you are treated by a provider outside of the preferred network all of the plans would cap outofpocket expenses at 1 500 per person and 3 000 per family per year regardless of deductibles or copayments another approaclr to solving our health care problem in this country is called the singlepayer approach the singlepayer system of health care guarantees universal access to comprehensive quality health care at a price that americans can afford under a singlepayer plan health care costs for all americans would be paid by a single public entity like social security or medicare the current network of 1 500 different insurance companies each with its own rules each with its own set of claims forms each with its own level of services would be replaced by a single agency that would pay all health care costs all of the health care services for individuals the government agency would not run the health care facility the delivery facilities but would simply replace our current inefficient system of paying for the health care that is being delivered to our citizens the present mix of private and public doctors other medical professionals and health care facilities would remain the singepayer system would merely streamline the billpaying process and eliminate the complex and repetitive billing and duplicative system which we now have which costs consumers billions of dollars per year paying the hospital and doctor bills alone the singlepayer system would curb health care costs through a global budget and a budget discipline unattainable when you have 1 500 companies paying the bills the singlepayer system would be progressively financed through a combination of corporate and personal taxes these taxes would replace the premium the people who have insurance now are paying in most cases would end up being less money than they are paying in premiums and would replace the outofpocket expenses that they now pay and claim back on our income tax return for individual as well as corporate health care costs and overall as i said earlier the costs would go down all health care revenues would be placed in a national health trust fund that could be used only for health care expenditures the specific tax rate and fees would vary under the different singlepayer proposals if a singlepayer system were in place individuals would be issued a national health security card which would be similar to a social security card that they now have individuals could go to the health care provider of their choice and receive treatment simply by presenting the card covered services would include all medically necessary procedures as well as prescription drugs and longterm care under most singlepayer plans there is no copayment or deductible the singlepayer pays either directly at an annually negotiated payment structure or through negotiated annual budgets health care providers would be guaranteed payment and they would no longer have to alter the treatment to fit the insurance status of their patients the singlepayer plan would be administered at the state level according to federal standards with the participation of consumers businesses and health care providers by allowing for state administration the health care system could be adjusted to reflect local conditions and needs going back to the beginning i said that i would support a health care system that would allow for universal access have cost containment that would include quality assurance in the delivery of health care services that would promote disease prevention that would promote health and wellness rather than illness and which allows for a choice of doctors the only plan that provides for all of these is the singlepayer plan that is why i am a proud cosponsor and sulporter of the singlepayer plan which is introduced as house resolution 1200 a recent news report stated that over 600 000 americans were going to canada to get their health care i believe that is a ringing endorsement of the singlepayer approach to health care it is impossible however to reform our health care system without reforming our welfare system the president this evening is expected to propose a welfare reform package which the house would consider sometime this session both the committee on ways and means and the committee on education and labor are expected to hold hearings on the administrations plan once it is submitted to congress during the campaign the candidate william j clinton said he would end welfare as we know it by placing a time limit on the enrollment in aid to families with dependent children which is called afdc which now serves i in 7 of our nations children almost 1 in 7 of all our children are receiving aid to families with dependent children benefits in a companion pledge candidate clinton said he would end poverty of children with fulltime working parents by changing the tax code among other things the reform of welfare according to the president would accomplish several things it would limit afdc payments to 2 years and within that time would empower the parents mostly mothers with schooling training and child care needed to break the cycle of dependency i wish the president godspeed and success in that endeavor however i remind him that the same congress that must pass the limitations upon welfare mothers receiving benefits and providing schooling and training for welfare mothers and child care has failed just last year to provide day care funding to provide benefits for young teenagers so that they will have jobs in the summer of 1993 i wish the president well a welfare reform program must provide community service work for those who can work but are without private jobs after their afdc ends it must provide an earned income tax credit to make up the difference between fulltime earnings of a family with children and the familys poverty level income threshold we need to decide what it takes for a family to get by on and if a member of the family is working and they are not coming up to the minimum that we said that they ought to have to get by on say 20 000 the government should provide the rest should require that individual to receive additional training and schooling get a ged and take college credits and otherwise prepare themselves for jobs but we are going to have to find some jobs that are available we are preparing people right now for jobs that do not exist in this country most of our lower paying low wage jobs are going to other countries the president says he wants to start a national deadbeat data bank and use that and other means of enforcing child support against deadbeat parents and i commend him for that i applaud the efforts of the president within the budget reconciliation bill to improve the status of working families in this country the childrens initiative within the budget act which included the earned income tax credit expansion of the food stamp program increased funding for family preservation and childhood immunization were real definitive first steps toward a real investment in human needs currently it is politically popular however to bash people on welfare welfare comes in many forms a subsidy is welfare when we pay a cotton farmer not to plant we are giving him or her welfare when we pay for the bailout of the savings and loan debacle in this country we are providing welfare not only for the directors and investors of the savings and loan associations that went under but we are providing welfare for the people who put their hardearned money into these savings and loans and lost it through the unscrupulous acts of the boards of directors welfare comes in many forms it is not just for poor people when we bailed out chrysler corporation 7 years ago that was welfare but it is popular to bash welfare and put the face of the single headofhousehold mother on there as if she is the reason that there is a drain on the system several of my colleagues have gone to the step of introducing or will introduce bills that abolish afdc jobs the food stamps program and job training partnership act and many other job training programs put strict time limits on how long they can receive welfare in an era when 15 percent of our poor people are unemployed it makes a lot of sense to take away their hope in order to address human needs welfare reform must reduce the need for welfare the reform of the aid tq families with dependent children program cannot succeed in the absence of a broader antipoverty strategy families are often forced to rely on welfare i know a lot of people that had good jobs 3 years ago when they ran out of unemployment compensation because the congress would not pass additional unemployment benefits some of these same members who want to take away the welfare are the ones who would not provide unemployment benefits for these people who were out of a job welfare in a majority of cases is not a willing choice and where it is a willing choice we ought to work to take it away but the antipoverty program must include child support benefits of all children improve unemployment insurance universal acdess to health care increased minimum wage and a refundable child care credit we just invest in education and training opportunities for welfare recipients federal funding for the job opportunities and basic skills program or any successor programs should be increased to expand education and training services that give participants the skills to a decent paying steady stable job we must allow people to work for wages not for welfare public sector employment created for people leaving the afdc system must provide pay and benefits equal to other workers doing the same job without displacing current workers the afdc system should allow working parents to receive benefits and not be penalized for their own work effort a safety net must be provided for those who wish to leave the afdc system curtailing access to welfare without reducing the need for income support would only increase poverty and hurt needy families while increasing crime in our country finally the welfare system must treat people with dignity family cap provisions or a limit on the number of children one can have restrictions on migration and other measure that seek to punish certain behaviors hurt needy families and do nothing to help them escape from poverty a reformed welfare system should emphasize incentives over penalties we in the congress need a powerful sense of determination to banish the ugly blemishes of crime of a lack of adequate health care and of poverty scarring the image of america we can of course try to temporize negotiate small inadequate changes and prolong the timetable of justice in the hope that the narcotic of delay will dull the pain of progress we can try but we will certainly fail the shape of our nation and the world will not permit the past luxury of gradualism and procrastination any longer solutions to the complex conundrums of crime health care and welfare will not be easy this does not signify that they are impossible recognizing these complexities as challenges rather than as obstacles we will make real progress if we freely admit that there is no magic we will make progress if we accept the fact that 14 years of deficit spending ignorance to human needs and politically sexy socalled solutions cannot be canceled out in 14 minutes or 14 days or 14 months of atonement neither can we allow the guilty to tailor their atonement in such a manner as to visit another 14 years of deliberate hurt upon the victims the debate about crime health care and welfare is at its least common denominator a struggle for opportunities in asking for something the low and middle class are not seeking charity the low and middle class do not want to languish on welfare rolls any more than the next person the low and middle class and the poor in this country do not want to be given a job that they do not deserve neither however do they want to be told there is no place they can be trained to handle these jobs that will be created in the future with equal opportunity must cofne the practical realistic aid which will equip people to seize these opportunities giving a pair of shoes to a person who has not learned to walk is not just cruel it is criminal with real crime real health care and real welfare reform we can begin to find the answers to neutralizing the years of neglect and hopelessness whole generations have been left behind as a majority of the population has advanced those lost generations have never learned basic social skills at a functional level the skills of reading and writing and arithmetic andapplying for a job and exercising the rights of citizenship including the right to vote that is why they are walking around not caring about our society they think they are not a part of it moreover urban and suburban and rural poverty has not only stilled lives it has created emotional disturbances many of which manifest themselves in antisocial actions in the streets of houston tx and washington dc every day the most tragic victims are the children of those parents who struggle and fail to provide not just food clothing and shelter but a stable environment for our children i too sing america the america i sing has stood solidly behind the commitment to the principles of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the america that i sing is reinforced by a substantial investment in the financial and human capital needed to make her great the america that i love like many other of my colleagues and my family recognize that we have paid a price for public service some monetarily but all of us with regard to the time that we in our families invest we must remember the price because when we do we as a congress have the courage to dive on the grenade to live up to the challenge for our people and not just another commercial we must do the job that is necessary for all of our people"], [0.5129656195640564, 0.4870343804359436, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman for a very fine statement and for the number of facts that he has brought out that i think are very very important that people need to consider as they look at this reconciliation bill that the president has brought forward i think what the gentleman said about the necessity of deficit reduction is absolutely correct in my view the deficit is a dagger pointed at the economic heart of this country and after 12 years of inaction on the deficit it is now time that we have to take the responsibility for dealing with the deficit in my view we had institutional irresponsibility for 12 years that produced a 4 trillion debt we now have the chance and we are at the crossroads where we have to take the responsibility and lead toward a conclusion which will bring this deficit under control a lot of people are saying that there are not enough spending cuts in the plan i think i may be wrong but i think this is the largest spending cut proposal that we have ever seen the gentleman set out the kind of cuts we are looking at agricultural entitlement cuts 3 billion federal workers 11 billion as the gentleman said there are 30 specific cuts in medicare and medicaid that reduce the deficit by 556 billion 11 billion in federal administrative costs 2 2 billion streamlining education programs 1 billion out of highway demonstration projects and 53 billion in veterans program cuts nobody likes to talk about cuts one of my problems in discussing this bill is that everybody is for cuts in general but nobody wants to talk about cuts in specific that has been our problem for the last 12 years people want to talk about a balanced budget amendment or they want to talk about a cap on entitlements or they want to talk about some other process gimmick the grammrudman or grammlatta or some other gizmo that is going to solve our problems the truth is there is no solution to the budget problem unless there are specific suggestions of cuts and that is what president clinton has had the courage to do and what the committees of the congress here have brought to the floor are specific recommendations for cuts nobody likes taxes i hate taxes i wish we did not have to have one tax but if we are going to have taxes as part of the solution and i think we must because the cuts are deep indeed then the taxes that have been presented are the fairest taxes we have seen for over 12 years as the gentlemans chart shows the taxes are taxes on the wealthiest people in the country this is not soaktherich we are not after rich people we do not want to do anything to harm rich people we want more rich people in this country but the wealthy like everybody else have to pay their fair share and the chart the gentleman shows right next to him shows that under the 1990 budget agreement that we negotiated with george bush the poorest people in the country were bearing the worst part of the burden and the richest people the lowest part of the burden under the clinton plan on top it is the highest people that are taking the highest burden the chart to my right shows again 66 percent share of the taxes for people over 200 000 75 percent of the taxes come from people over 100 000 a lot of people are saying well they do not like this tax or that tax or the other tax fine we have said tell us the alternative in spending cuts that will take care of that tax people want to get very general then they do not want to be specific we have got to be specific about the spending cuts we have an alternative in the other body where members republicans and democrats have come up with an alternative the problem i see with the alternative is that it is more of the same from the past it is another budget from the past it is a budget that says let us not tax the people who are the wealthiest in the country so much let us give them a capitalgains break it says let us lower the taxation for medicare on those folks who make over 100 000 a year let us do other things that will help people at the very top and let us increase taxes on people at the bottom by lowering the earnedincome credit which is the most important thing for progressivity in the clinton budget that is in this reconciliation bill and yes let us cut social security cola let us cut medicare and let us cut medicaid again i am not for that and i think if you put that alternative on the floor you would not get many votes for it on either side of the aisle if you it in the other body i suspect it might be the same we have problems in this country today with being specific about what we want to do president clinton has been specific he has put a concrete proposal in front of us and our committees have brought that proposal forward it is a good proposal we are at crossroads in the country either we deal with this problem that is eating us alive or we do not now people say gee i am against that btu tax it is going to cost me in the third year and remember it is phased in but in the third year for an average family of four it is going to cost us 15 or 17 a month what they are not looking at is that if we can get this proposal through interest rates will be held down over the next 3 years to an extent where they will get much more benefit than the costs of the btu tax jobs will be created the recovery will go forward we will not fall back into another recession we will begin to get economic growth in this society we do not do a deficitreduction plan as an academic exercise it is not to make somebody in a university feel good who studies economics it is to get concrete results in the economy in the country we are trying to create jobs we are trying to hold inflation down we are trying to hold interest rates down and we are trying to stay out of another recession that we have been in now for 3 years i was at home the other day with the unemployment people and a fellow who has been in the unemployment office for 30 years said he has never seen recovery like this he said congressman there are no jobs he said i can get minimumwage jobs people who want to work at mcdonalds we have got plenty of those what we do not have are good jobs i do not know how we get good jobs created in this society unless we do something real about the deficit unless we stand up finally and say here is a program that will get the deficit down over the next 5 years not smoke and mirrors not another gimmick not another gizmo not another promise and not another illusion something that works and is real that is what we are talking about with this plan and i believe it is fair i believe it is balanced and i think we have to show the leadership and the responsibility to go forward and pass this plan get it through the senate put it on the presidents desk as quickly as possible and move this country and this economy in a positive direction"], [0.5126745402812958, 0.4873254597187042, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume let me answer some of the questions first of all all of us as americans know we have the right to our basic beliefs and certainly there is absolutely nothing in this bill and it is restated over and over and over again there is nothing in this bill that interferes with the right to free speech free picketing anything that is peaceful and anything that is nonviolent but what we do not have the right to do as americans is take our beliefs and inflict or impose them on other peoples beliefs that is where your freedom ends your freedom ends where another persons beliefs begin you do not have the right to impose them and to overrule that there is nothing in this bill dealing with free speech or nonviolent picketing or you would never have the committee on the judiciary the aclu civil libertarians and everyone else backing it and i think we cannot say that enough what does this bill do it says you cannot block access to a clinic now why is that important well because since 1977 there have been 33 000 arrests for blockading clinics i have gone to our clinic in colorado when there have been people there blockading and ithas taken the police to get through the line so women could get inside for their health care when you read the editorials of the many newspapers who are talking about why this bill should be passed they went to the precedent that america has always had the federal government does not move in until it appears that in some parts of the country there is a breakdown that they cannot handle the numbers any more some places they handle it well but some places they just cannot deal any more and basically clinics are having to close because they cannot get that protection now as the gentlewoman from the district of columbia pointed out earlier that tradition is longstanding it is longstanding in the ku klux klan act unfortunately women in this country were told the ku klux klan act does not apply to them because they were not a protected class when it happened when it passed i hear what the gentlemen on the other side are saying i am sure bull connor said when he stood in front of the school door i am just standing here nonviolently yes but he was blocking access to the school door and it was a republican president mr eisenhower who said no that is not the american tradition and called out the national guard and made sure that he was moved to one side and children could have access there are many other federal laws that do not allow blockage of access under labor laws under section 158 b 1 a of the nlra it says during a strike that it is an unfair labor practice to block employees from exercising their right to access to the workplace there must be access or you can go into federal court and get an injunction i know this i use to work for the nlrb and that used to be my job so you can picket and do whatever you want but you cannot say no one can come into this workplace there are many other areas we have passed rules on animal rights violence we do not allow animal rights protestors to shut off a clinic that has animal laboratories going on they must allow access we have also got all sorts of laws that prohibit interference with voting you cannot go say i am just passively encircling this voting booth because we do not want those people to vote no that becomes a hostile act nor can you do it around a courthouse a federal courthouse nor can you do it to obstruct a foreign official from trying to conduct business nor can you do it on different federal grounds and places where different things are occurring so there is all sorts of federal laws i can put in those citations in the report i am not going to bore everyone what happened here is that in november both the house and senate passed this bill by substantial margins in the senate it was 69 to 30 in this house we voted 246 to 182 not to recommit the bill since november we have been thwarted from going to conference with the senate i have never seen it take this long to go to conference and i have never seen this have to stay around to get rules votes have all these procedural things we have had this argument over and over and over and over and over again and i find it really incredible that just to go to conference with the senate on this bill we are having to go through all these hurdles again are american womens rights that vulnerable apparently so because i do not think we would play around with other bills and other rights and at some point people say the majority have spoken the majority have spoken clearly and that we ought to proceed so tonight that is what i am trying to say the majority has spoken we ought to proceed we ought to get on to conference with the senate and we ought to be saying to american women yes they have the right to go to clinics for their health care the majority of women of childbearing age get their health care in these clinics that is where they go for all their health care when we did a survey or a survey was done by another group over 50 percent of the clinics have been harassed or surrounded or had acts of violence this has gone on and on and on i can read some of these horrendous acts of violence they have been very very very very serious so tonight i am not trying to delay this bill i am trying to move this bill and i certainly hope we can get on with it because i think americas women are getting very impatient with this and feel that it is time that their rights be given as much respect as everyone elses rights have been given as they have debated and debated and tied up and tried to do everything they could to thwart
