tlat members will not only not have time to fully consider or analyze the provisions within this bill we didnt even have time to read it this is a poor way to govern and i am disappointed that the majority has chosen to abuse the process so badly on what is traditionally a mostly bipartisan bill i supported the version of this bill that we passed in the house over the summer that version appropriated more than 400 billion for the department of defense it would have helped to keep faith with our service members by providing them with a much needed pay increase that bill also provided funding for our service members on the ground in iraq and afghanistan who are waiting for additional body armor and up armored humvees unfortunately the majority decided to destroy that bill by loading it up with special interests goodies what theyve done is the height of irresponsibility our service members should have every resource they need todo their job to protect and defend the

trade agreement a cousin of the north american free trade agreement which would extend the same naftatype trade provisions to six countries five in central america and the dominican republic unlike every other trade agreement which president bush has signed morocco chile singapore and australia which were signed and voted on by congress within 60 days the central american free trade agreement has simply languished in the halls of congress the president has not brought it forward to vote on in large part because the people of this body a majority of the members of congress will not vote for it and here is why it is pretty clear mr speaker that our trade policy is not working in 1992 the year i ran for congress we had a 38 billion trade deficit meaning we sold 38 billion less than we imported exported less than we imported 38 billion today or 2004 that number had increased to 618 billion from 38 billion to 618 billion in a dozen years maybe that is just numbers but when you look at the trade deficit and you know what it means it has meant in large part a huge loss of manufacturing jobs just in the last 6 years these states in red have all lost at least 20 percent of their manufacturing michigan 210 000 ohio 216 illinois 224 pennsylvania 200 mise 1815 we can play with numbers but the fact is the enforcement of labor standards in central america is basically nonexistent under cafta and under the presidents plans at the same time the international labor organization sets standards agreed on by all countries around the world to lift up labor standards so that workers can make a decent wage that workers can bargain and organize collectively the ilo standards prohibit child labor prohibit forced labor all the kinds of values that we in this country share with our colleagues and our workers in our families with all of that the administration is one of only two countries out of 80 in the world that is not fully supporting the ilo and what it wants to do in geneva with its funding with its programs with all that so it is pretty clear that the 20 million offer to support labor standards is just a fig leaf to try to convince a few members of congress to vote for the central american free trade agreement while all those deals have been going on a group of us had a rally today at the cannon building in washington a group of legislators from the united states and a group of legislators from central america they rallied against the central american free trade agreement not to kill it but to defeat this central american free trade agreement and come back with a better central american free trade agreement that protects the environment that helps working people in both countries all of us together have called on congress to pass a better central american free trade agreement these legislators from our country and from seven countries in central america and latin america understand that this cafta protects drug companies while harming the sick and the poor they understand this cafta protects the worlds largest corporations while hurting small businesses and working families they understand this trade agreement protects huge industries while undermining the environment they understand that they want and have called for a cafta that lifts workers up and raises living standards a cafta that protects people the same way it protects property rights and the drug industry a cafta that allows hiv patients access to affordable lifesaving drugs they understand most importantly that cafta was negotiated by a select few to benefit only a select few not the masses of people in our country and the other six cafta countries it is past time to renegotiate a trade agreement that works for all citizen of all seven cafta nations"], [0.0, 1.0, 1,

its supporters were it would create jobs in the unitedstates it would raise living standards in mexico by raising wages it would encourage and enable mexicans to buy more american products it would increase our balance of trade with canada and mexico positively those were the promises made by nafta we have heard those same promises when we passed the pntr with china we have heard those same promises on trade agreement after trade agreement but look what has happened to our trade deficit in that period starting in 1992 the year i first ran for congress our trade deficit was 38 billion you can see it passes 100 billion in the early 1990s almost 200 billion in the mid 1990s president bush took office goes up to 400 billion 450 billion 500 billion this year our trade deficit was 617 billion that means that we are buying 617 billion more in products than we are selling so what is the presidents response the presidents response is the central american free trade agreement more of the same followed he hopes by something called free trade area of the americas cafta and ftaa will double the population of nafta mexico the unitedstates and canada and quadruple the number of low income workers 5l 2000 they say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again and expecting a different result we are hearing the same promises about cafta that it will raise living standards and raise wages in central america that it will create jobs in the united states that we will export more and more to central america that it will reduce our trade deficit it is the same old song it was the same song for nafta it is the same song for naftas dysfunctional cousin cafta the central american free trade agreement this president is going to come to congress and again ask us to pass another free trade agreement that hemorrhages american jobs that costs us especially manufacturing jobs my state under president bush has lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs this country has lost around 2 million manufacturing jobs in the 4 years that george bush has been president yet he continues to do the same thing tax cuts for the wealthiest people in our country trade agreements that hemorrhage jobs overseas just look at the facts look at what has happened with our trade deficit again it was 38 billion the year i ran for congress in 1992 today it is almost 20 times higher 617 billion trade deficit we had a trade surplus with mexico in 1992 today we have a 40 billion trade deficit with mexico again the president looks at these numbers and he says let us do more of the same clearly our trade policy is not working clearly the president is taking the country in the wrong direction on trade every trade agreement this congress has passed from president bush has been signed by the president and then passed within congress by about 60 days president bush signed the central american free trade agreement on may 28 he has yet to try to push it through congress because he knows the american people oppose the central american free trade agreement and he knows the united states congress opposes this central american free trade agreement fully 90 percent of democrats in the house of representatives plan to vote against cafta because democrats understand and i hope enough of my republican colleagues come along understand that the central american free trade agreement is bad for our cominunity it is bad for our families it is bad for our workers it simply does not work for our country it betrays american values of hard work

and the argument relating to the nonproliferation regime as you have laid it out but i think we have an honest disagreement about the approach to india and whether or not that will strengthen the regime and that is what is playing itself out in debate here from my standpoint the proliferation issues have been between pakistan and north korea whereas india has shown itself resistant to proliferation and has shown a willingness to look at a way to be brought into the fold of the mpt so i saw that earlier initiative to bring india within the framework agreement and with the mpt as a positive step forward and with respect to this legislation basically what it does is to apply exactly the same system of forced compliance on companies that now exist with respect to iran and syria that is to say that in terms of getting a licensing agreement or having the ability to ship technologies into north korea that could be used for the purpose of eventually developing those weapon systems that will be prohibited that is the intent pf the legislation and i thank the gentleman for yielding mr wu reclaiming my time unlike the gentleman from ohio the dialectic of proliferation is way beyond me i do recognize a bad idea when i see one and encouraging india by selling it nuclear fissile materials which would ultimately result in the increase of chinese nuclear weapons and pakistani nuclear weapons is surely that bad idea there are times when we are all in the minority at one time or another there was 68 of us who voted against approving the treaty to sell nuclear fissile materials to india on that vote i would have been happy to have been a minority of one because i do believe that it would add fuel to the fire of nuclear proliferation in south asia in that it basically does blow out of the water any hope we have of treaty constraints on the proliferation of nuclear weapons i want to make it clear in this record and for history that the actions of this administration in nuclear proliferation or trying to contain nuclear proliferation have beeil patently irresponsible this administration has underfunded the nunnlugar legislation which seeks to purchase fissile materials which would be otherwise available to terrorists on the open market this administration has proposed a treaty with india that would sell india nuclear fissile materials that would result in a nuclear arms race between india and china and india and pakistan and pakistan is not a stable country there is great danger of the leakage of nuclear weapons from pakistan you heard earlier from another speaker about pakistani aid to nuclear proliferation elsewhere in the world let the record show that if or when a mushroom cloud ever erupts over an american city it will be

can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates

policies that this republican majority and the administration have enacted to deliberately deprive our government of the resources that it needs and that our people know our country needs finally mr speakdr let me say that i am particularly incensed that at a time of record heating costs the subcommittee defeated mr obeys amendment to provide an additional 2 billion for the low income home energy assistance program i predict to you today just as when we rejected funding for the veterans that we said was necessary and their health care you are going to be back here with a supplemental funding additional energy costs for seniors and by the way let me also say mr obey had an amendment which was going to give to seniors an additional 6 months to make a determination to figure out this incredibly complex prescription drug bill that we have put on their doorstep and that was rejected unanimously by republicans while it was unanimously supported by democrats the message here is unmistakable and sad while the wealthy have money to burn the poor get to shiver in silence i simply do not understand why the majority refused to adopt a second amendment as i said to extend time for seniors we all know the reality the republican prescription drug plan is so complicated and confusing that millions of seniors need and deserve more time to weigh their options i urge my colleagues to vote against their conference report i regrettably say that but i think the failures contained in it compel that conclusion"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "our nation is addicted to oil and it is a national security issue the fact that twothirds of the oil that we consume is imported puts us at risk today leftwing autocrats like venezuelas hugo chavez have told us very clearly they plan to use oil as a political weapon against the united states there is a reason we have 3 gasoline it is time that we replace imported oil with domestic homegrown biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel last years energy bill was a good start doubling the biofuels that we consume from 4 billion to 7 6 billion gallons by the year 2011 that is why today there are 26 organizations in illinois planning to move forward to build ethanol plants five in the district that i represent alone but that only represents 2 5 percent of all the fuel that we consume so we need to do more i urge this house to move forward on an aggressive plan to replace imported oil with the homegrown biofuels the biofuels act of 2006 accomplishes that goal let us pass it let us move it now"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "on rolicall no 154 i was

debate let for out of this gap that is what they me just kind of let everybody know lose in a conversion where we are the senate passed a bill all we are sayingin this effort is to a bipartisan bill the house passed a simply provide these people the addibipartisan bill with a vote of 294132 tional protections that the senate prosome of the democrats voting for the vided by 972 now we know this is a bill during jhe debate you have seen very partisan congress but 97 people we have had republicans speak for the came together and decided to try to democrat side we have had democrats help these individuals they still allow speak for the republican side for the conversions to cash balance we are all concerned as mr foley they provide the certainty that the said about the workers of america employers want and they provide the where we are now is we have each protection that the employees need passed bills a conference has been ap now this house can continue to folpointed senator enzi is chairman of low the republican bill the republican direction on pensions that has made the pension plan less secure made the pension plan more in jeopardy whether it is the taxpayers who are at risk or the employees who are at risk that is the wrong direction finally on a bipartisan basis a choice was made to go in a different direction to stop this failed policy pick up your usa today read your usa today today and you will see that they make it clear that the bill that is currently in conference the house bill puts pensions in greater jeopardy with greater risk that it will raise the risk that these people will lose their pensions why because the republicans continue to let you manipulate the pension data you can say that your employees are going to die younger so you will not have to pay out as much money whether they will or not has no bearing in fact so what are we doing here we are trying to go in a different direction we are trying to go in the direction of pension security of retirement security of peace of mind for people who are working hard understanding that these employees earn these pensions and they should not lose them because some accountant can just come along and change it with the whisk of a pencil it is not fair to those individuals that is about the values of those people who are working hard it is about young people knowing that their parents will be takeh care of that they will be able to have that retirement security millions of americans are watching as pension plans are crashing to the floor as conversions are made and older workers are jettisonedin terms of these protections but you can change that with this motion to instruct you can change it along the lines of a bipartisan consensus in the senate which said you can both protect these workers have the certainty of your conversions and allow employers to choose to have con versions or defined benefit plans it is the best of all worlds it is the fairness the other reason republicans can vote for it tonight is because i understand the republican leadership said go ahead and vote your conscience well tonight we will find out about the republican conscience do they really want to take care of older americans who are terrified about their retirement security we will find out tonight wont we because you do not have to jeopardizecash balance you do not have to jeopardize the certainty of discrimination but you do get to take care of the retirees and you can do it all in one vote a motion to instruct here so i suggest you come on down and let us change the direction of retirement security from insecurity that is now being presented by this conference committee by the republican bill to one of security for americas workers for americas retirees to make sure that they will have the ability to take care ofthemselves and their families in the future it is fundamental it is basic it is about fairness it is about the direction of this country we have got

president victor yushchenkos victory today america looks upon a world very different from that which existed less than twenty years ago where once millions of people were trapped under the heels of tyrants they now are enjoying the liberties we fought for more than two centuries ago our former rivals have become allies in the fight for freedom and democracy the most recent example of this comes from ukraine where a drawnout election has produced a new leadership for the citizens of this former soviet republic in ukraine the will of the people proved stronger than threats and oppression as tens of thousands of young ukrainians took to the streets to protest fraudulent elections ultimately they were heard and victor yushchenko was elected to be their president these elections are a triumphant accomplishment for the people of ukraine but by no means do they guarantee freedom the struggle for liberty is a constant one and in order for ukrainians to fully realize their dream for representation the new government of president victor yushchenko must rid the country of the corruption that has plagued it for so long if this can be done ukraine will be able to realize a bright and productive future when i visited ukraine in december i met some of the people who made it possible to overturn the fraudulent elections it is hard to express how inspiring it was to see the pride and dedication that those young people exhibited i can bnly hope that these qualities can find a home in the hearts of the young people in other societies and fuel the desire for freedom around the globe i also met with the physician who diagnosed president yushchenko with dioxin poisoning after his face was so badly distorted by what appears to have been an effort to kill him and the reforms he represents the symbolism behind this mans struggle is hard to ignore parallels can be drawn between the desperate grasps for dwindling power by others who have ruled without consent and the cowardly poisoning of this remarkable man president yushchenko also represents the strength and inevitability of freedom itself rather than surrender he drove forward both for his supporters and for his country through its orange revolution ukraine has shown the world the strength and courage of its people with its well educated workforce and bountiful natural resources the country is poised for a prosperous future president yushchenko has expressed his desire for his country to join nato and the european union the united states should support ukraines desire to fully join the west at the same
