between the united states and canada it is important legislation there were some questions as to the constitutionality and the committee reviewed them went over them with the members of the executive branch and appropriate members of the congress and appropriate committees of the congress and i believe that everything is in order insofar as we can determine i rise in support of h r 5090 legislation to implement the united statescanada freetrade agreement the committee on the judiciary favorably reported h r 5090 by voice vote on august 2 1988 one of the primary issues of judiciary committee jurisdiction in the free trade agreement and the implementing legislation is the creation of a binational panel review mechanism under current law all initial review of agency determinations involving antidumping and countervailing duty matters is conducted by the court of international trade the free trade agreement eliminates this jurisdiction and any subsequent appellate court jurisdiction for reviewing antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving canadian igoods similarly under the free trade agreement canadian judicial review of antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving united states goods is eliminated instead the free trade agreement creates a panel composed of united states and canadian citizens which will review agency determinations involving united states or canadian goods a panel reviewing a unitedstates agency deternilnation must apply unitedstates law the committee on the judiciary believes it is constitutional for judicial review of antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving canadian goods to be eliminated and replaced by this binatlonal panel system substantial oral and written testimony supporting this conclusion was received by the judiciary subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice as part of its hearing on april 28 1988 prof andreas f lowenfeld of the new york university school of law advised the subcommittee that decisions of the department of commerce of the unitedstates international trade commission in antidumping and countervailing duty cases need not be subject to judicial review by a united states court established under article iii of the constitution similarly prof louis henkin of the columbia university school of law wrote tfie subcommittee that the constitution does not require any review of duty determinations if review is provided the constitution does not require that it be by an article ii court or by any court congress can provide for review by a nonofficial body so long as the review is in accord with standards set by congress and the means for selecting the body and its procedures are reasonable and fair once the free trade agreement and accompanying implementing legislation are approved by congress and signed by the president the decisions of the binational panels are binding on the united states as a matter of both domestic and international law the panels will be applying international law some have raised a question as to whether the binational panels and extraordinary challenge committees create a problem under the appointments clause of the constitution on the grounds that panelists who were not officers of the united staes would be exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states the judiciary subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice received substantial expert testimony that no appointments clause problem is raised professor lowenfeld of the nyu school of law stated that though the binational panels to be created pursuant to the free trade agreement have adjudicatory functions i do not believe they would be exercising the judicial power of the united states and i do not believe that it is consistent with the concept of international dispute settlement to regard either the panels themselves or their unitedstates citizen members as officers of the united states similar testimony was received from prof harold bruff of the university of texas law school joseph p griffin on behalf of the section of international law and practice of the american bar association professor henkin of columbia law school and the committee on international trade of tie association of the bar of the city of new york the comnittee agreed that no appointments clause problem is raised the binational panels are established to implement the fta an international law agreement the panelists will apply international law under the fta as testimony indicated at the subcommittee hearing the authority that will be exercised by panelists will be authority pursuant to international law not pursuant to the laws of the united states ever

the united states has frequently participated in the creation of international bodieswhose members are not executive officersto resolve disputes on a binding basis the iranunited states claims

binational tribunal established between the united states and spain by treaty in 1819 to resolve boundary disputes concerning cessation of florida to the united states 4 second boundary commission set up by the united states and great britain in 1903 to resolve boundary disputes involving alaska 5 and third binational tribunal between the united states and mexico established by the claims agreement of july 4 1868 to resolve certain disputes 8 as stated by prof harold h bruff at the subcommittee hearing the case of buckley versus valedo should not be read to condemn this history or to require formal appointment of the arbitrators to federal office since a central function of the appointments clause is to allow executive supervision of officers such appointments would either be inconsistent with the arbitral role or would needlessly trivittlize the appointments clause as prof lois henkin testified to the subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice once the pta is approved by congress and signed by the president it will be the law of the land equal in authority to any act of congress or treaty of the united states no further statutory direction is necessary in legislation for the president to implement the law of the land article ii section 3 of the constitution already requires the president to take care that the laws be faithfully executed the fta will be adopted by congress through implementing legislation and signed into law by the presi dent as acknowledged in a letter i received dated may 24 1988 from the department of justice the president will be found to implement binational panel decisions as a matter of international law it is well established that settlement of claims agreement january 19 4treaty of amity settlement and

v key 110 unitedstates 63 1884 recognized that a decision by this tri bunal was binding upon the unitedstates government international law is a part of the law of the united states 7 accordingly the committee is convinced that there is no appointments clause problem with the binational pancls and the extraordinary challenge comnittees or with the implementation of their decisions without presidential involvement as provided for in new section 516a g 7 a of the tariff act of 1930 added by h r 5090 direction need merely be given as it is in the new section to the appropriate administering authority or the international trade commission as appropriate to implement a panel or committee decision remanding a determination additionally new subsection g 7 a provides certainty that panel and committee decisions will in fact be implemented this is a point that is very important not only to canada in the context of this fta but also to countries that may wish to enter into free trade negotiations with the united states in the future if a precondition of implementing a panel or committee decision was the presidents acceptance of the decision there would be no assurance to canada that panel or committee decisions would in fact be carried out by the united states such a requirement would not bode well for prospects of future trade agreements the provisions set forth in new section 516a g 7 a of the tariff act of 1930 as added by the implementing legislation are constitutionally sufficient to implement the decisions of binational panels and extraordinary challenge committees however the commtte acknowledged the concerns of the administration about the impact on the fia in the unlikely event that this new implementing subsection is held to be unconstitutional while the committee and the many experts consulted believe that new subsection g 7 a of section 516a of the tariff act of 1930 is constitutional the committee did not want the success of the fta to be endangered in the unlikely event subsection g 7 a is held unconstitutional by the supreme court accordingly a fallback provision has been included in the implementing legislation mandating presidential acceptance in whole of a binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee decision as a prerequisite for administering authority or international trade commission implementation the administration has stated its intent to accept every panel or committee decision should this failback position included in the legislation as new subsection g 7 b of 516a of the tariff act of 1930

unlikely event that this falloack provision becomes operable all binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee decisions will be implemented providing certainty to oi canadian partner the inclusion of a fallback provision in a statute is extremely unusual it has been included because of the uniqueness and importance of the fta and the importance of implementation of panel and committee decisions to the fta the committee agreed with the administrations point in the statement of administrative action that uncertaintyno matter how brief in timeabout whether or how such decisions are carried out by the agencies to which they are remanded could jeopardize the succes of the agreement another provision in h r 5 190 reviewed by the judiciary committee is section 307 which impacts upon the immigration laws i believe that this provision is fairly modest when you consider that the fta directs the united states to provide for the temporary entry of canadian business persons and at the same time mandates that the united states not impose a labor certification requirement or otherwise make the admission of a canadian dependent on the lack of availability of a united states employee now this is not the type of road i think we should be traveling down and i have always been of the view that labor market tests are vitally important but the issue here is not whether we agree or disagree with all the provisions of the fta but whether h r 5090 is a reasonable way to implement the fta and i think it is essentially the only significant change to the immigration laws made by h r 5090 is that canadian professionals will be allowed to enter under a new and separate category of law and though this may give some of us pause for concern i think the reporting requirements contained in the statement of administrative action will give the congress sufficient information and opportunity to monitor and if necessary change the program"], [0.4893960952758789, 0.5106039047241211, 1, "h r 4712 reauthorizes the office of government ethics for 6 additional years establishes it as a separate agency within the executive branch and makes several other important changes to improve its operation it was reported by the committee on post office and civil service on august 10 of this year and was jointly referred to the committee on the judiciary which had in february of this year reported hr 3997 which provided for a straight 6year reauthorization the office of government ethics was established within the office of personnel management by title iv of the ethics in government act of 1978 it was originally authorized for 5 years then reauthorized for 5 more years in 1983 in order for oge to continue its vital work especially important in this presidential transition year we need to work quickly to pass this reauthorization legislation as the centralized executive branch ethics office oge has the important responsibility of providing overall direction of executive branch policies aimed at preventing conflicts of interest and certain other ethics violations by officers and employees of every executive branch agency under the ethics act the oge director was charge with 15 significant responsibilities the director was given the responsibility for developing rules and regulations regarding conflicts of interest financial disclosure and ethical conduct by executive branch employees monitoring and investigating individual and agency compliance with financial disclosure requirements interpreting conflict of interest rules and regulations providing information on and promoting understanding of ethicals standards in executive agencies and ordering action by agencies and employees to comply with any laws rules regulations and executive orders related to conflicts of interest or employee standards of conduct 1l 9327 although under the current decentralized executive branch ethics system each agency has front line responsiblity for ensuring that its own employees comply with applicable ethics laws rules and regulations and that its own ethics program is properly administered oge is supposed to be the overseer the important backup or failsafe mechanism which kicks in to ensure that the ethics system doesnt break down over the past 3 years the two post office and civil service subcommittees i have chaired have devoted a substantial amount of time to exa mine the inner workings of oge we hve held a series of hearings and requested several studies looking at agency ethics programs cases of alleged misconduct and the mandate structure and performance of the office of government ethics the changes proposed to current law which are contained in the amendment reflect the concerns and findings developed during this detailed 3year review beyond merely reauthorizing oge for 6 years this measure carefully responds to some of oges shortcomings rather than making sweeping or dramatic changes which would ultimately be unworkable or expensive the amendment addresses certain problem areas within the context of the current ethics system the amendment clarifies and refines the current statute modifying only those portions which clearly need to be changed most importantly the amendment removes oge from within opm and establishes it as a separate excecutive agency this change is important to ensure that oge has the stature visibility respect and independence necessary for it to be truly effective this provision will also provide oge with the needed administrative freedom and flexibility to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness both the current oge director and his immediate predecessor in addition to many others in the government ethics community strongly support removing oge from opm in order to increase oge and agency accountability the amendment requires the oge director to submit biennial reports to congress and to promulgate regulations requiring agencies to submit annual reports to oge oges report to congress will contain a summary of the actions taken by the director to carry out his or her statutory responsibilities under title iv of the ethics act and any other information the director may consider appropriate agency reports to oge will desribe and evaluate the various elements comprising an agencys eithics program list the titles and duties of agency ethics officials and contain any other information the director may require the agency reports will provide oge and agencies with management data necessary for ensuring effective overall ethics programs another important provision of the amendment clarifies current statutory language which the gives the oge director the responsibility for ordering corrective action on the part of agencies and employees which the director deems necessary since 1983 many questions have been raised about the precise meaning and scope of this corrective action authority the confusion surrounding this authority had impeded oges effectiveness and needed to be cleared up section 7 clarifies the authority by expounding on the current statute to reflect congresss original intent in order to utilize this corrective action authority the director is given the authority to make findings concerning employees violations of any rule regualtion or executive order relating to conflicts of interest and standards of conduct the amendment also requires the oge director to ensure that each executive agency has established written procedures for the collection filing review and public availability if applicable of financial disclosure reports these written procedures must be reviewed and approved by the director the confidential and public financial disclosure systems can only be effective in preventing and helping to identify potential conflicts of interest if agency officials develop and follow such established procedures without them laxity inconsistency and ad hoc determinations render the disclosure system ineffective if we are to have a truly effective executive branch ethics system it is crucial that we have a strong visible competent and independent oge and oge director whose policies and actions promote public confidence in government oge must do more to ensure that executive branch officials and employees decisions are not tainted by conflict of interest and that public servants are acting in the publics interest this measure will help achieve that end i strongly urge that it be adopted"], [0.4894977807998657, 0.5105022192001343, 1, "today this house must decide whether to exercise its constitutional power to impeach judge alcee l hastings in carrying out this serious and solemn duty our decision must be based on the clear intent behind the constitutional impeachment provision which is expressly reserved for those serious offenses by public officials that betray the public trust and undermine the integrity of high public office as with all other aspects of the checks and balances in our system of government the framers of the constitution structured impeachment in a manner that rejects a system of pure efficiency in favor of a more complex procedure that maximizes the integrity and independence of t ie federal judiciary to the framers mandating an intricate process for the removal of federal judges seemed a small price to pay to ensure the american populace an independent judiciary in explaining why impeachment was one of a number of overlapping features aimed at preserving judicial autonomy the framers were concerned that the judiclary was the most vulnerable of the three branches because unlike the executive it cannot rely on its control of the army and unlike the legislature it has no control over the power of the purse they were concerned that any less complex machinery might not sufficiently protect the judiciary from the political backlash of their decisions thus the founding fathers fully anticipated that impeachment would be a cumbersome affair generating controversy and divisiveness and demanding much attention by members of congress yet they believed that no other branch of government was as qualified to undertake this duty or would safeguard the impeachment process as scrupulously from vindictive or frivolous accusations history attests to the care with which the congress has discharged its prescribed responsibility since 1787 the house of representatives has impeached 14 federal officers one president one cabinet officer one senator and 11 federal judges twelve of the impeached officers were tried in the senate two resigned prior to senate proceedings five of the twelve impeachments that went to trial resulted in conviction and removal from office all five involved federal judges while the power of impeachment has been exercised infrequently it has as the founding fathers intended played a special and essential role in maintaining the integrity of the federal judiciary as members of this body have recognized in prior judicial impeachments the judges of the federal courts occupy a unique position of trust and responsibility in our system of government they are the only members of any branch that

determine whether judge hastings had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts on august 4 1986 the committee of judges appointed to investigate the complaint submitted its report and recommendations to the judicial council of the eleventh circuit the report found that the evidence considered in its totality clearly and convincingly established that judge hastings had engaged in a corrupt conspiracy to obtain a bribe frcm the defendants in a case which was pending before him the report also found that there was clear and convincing evidence that judge hastings had testified falsely at his trial in an attempt to conceal his participation in the bribery scheme on september 2 1986 the judicial council of the eleventh

council on march 17 1987 chief justice rehnquist acting on behalf of the conference transmitted the report and the records of the investigation to the speaker of the house stating in language mandated

thousands of documents were reviewed and analyzed extensive litigation to obtain additional documents and testimony was engaged in successfully and new areas of inquiry not considered by the jury at

indian water rights settlement act the people in colorado and new mexico have come to congress and said heres a solution to a problem please let us resolve it colorado ute indian water rights final settlement agreement of december 10 1986 was entered into by the southern ute indian tribe the ute mountain ute indian tribe the united states the state of colorado and 10 other entities representing water users it is the culmination of 2 years of intensive negotiations the reserved water rights claims of the two tribes would have disrupted the established economy of the nonindian water users in southwestern colorado had they been litigated instead a lasting and equitable settlement of the tribes claims which harmonizes with nonindian interests has been achieved through compromise and accommodation federal legislation is required to implement selected provisions of the agreement that is why i introduced h r 2642 the final settlement agreement with the tribes came about because the united states filed applications for reserved water rights for the tribes in 1976 in colorado district court the two ute indian tribes water rights claims cover more than 25 rivers and streams in southwest colorado among those rivers and streams are the animas and la plata rivers the tribes claims also extend to the east of the main city in the area in the case of the southern ute tribe and to the west in the case of the ute mountain tribe water users on other streams such as the mancos river are similarly jeopardized by tile tribal claims in essence what the parties have done is agree on the decree which they will ask the colorado court to enter the decree will qualify water rights for the tribes and define the terms and conditions of their use and administering to avoid litigating these issues the agreement provides a comprehensive settlement of the tribes claims for water which will enable the economic development of their reservations it has several major componenits first the tribes will receive water from the animasla plata and dolores projects and additional rights to water from various streams which pass through their reservations second in exchange for these water rights the tribes will waive all of their reserved rights claims and any claims which they may have against tile united states for breach of trust in the united states capacity as the tribes trustee third 60 5 million will be placed in development funds for the tribes to enable them to develop their water resources and to otherwise make their reservations the tribal development funds the settlement of tribes water rights claims cannot be accomplished without the construction of the animasla plata project the people who have been engaged in the efforts to resolve the tribes claims have been unable to identify any feasible settlement without the project the two ute tribes are convinced that the present settlement with its reliance on construction of the project is the only viable option for a negotiated settlement a study published in 1984 by an economist with fort lewis college co estimated that if the tribes were to litigate their water rights claims the surrounding nonindian communities would suffer substantial economic injury land values in the area would decline by over 9 million and the property tax base would erode the study also suggested the farming community would suffer an annual loss of over 2 5 million per year under these circumstances the keystone of the settlement is the construction of the dolores and animasla plata projects to provide an augmented water supply so that existing nonindian uses can be preserved and future tribal needs met the two projects provide a reliable water supply and will provide tile cushion which helped all parties reaching a settlement on all the streams subject to the litigation the checkerboard nature of the southern ute indian reservation however makes it virtually impossible economically selfsufficient fifth nonfederal parties will contribute money to the settlement for the financing of the animasla plata project and the tribal development funds the financial aspects of the settlement are complex and rely upon a significant nonfederal commitment to the tribes the nonfederal financial contributions to the settlement take two forms first upfront financing for the animasla plata project which will provide a sizeable portion of the tribes water and second payments by the state of colorado to tribal development funds federal budgetary outlays for the animasla plata project have been reduced by 39 percent this reduction was accomplished through cash contributions by the nonfederal parties in the amount of 68 million toward the construction of the first phase of the project and bccause the nonfederal parties are assuming the responsibility for the 133 million needed to construct the second phase of the project ii 93 15 the state of colorado is also providing 11 million of the 60 5 million tribal development fund the first 6 million of this will be provided for the construction by the state of a pipeline which will deliver the ute mountain ute tribes domestic water supply from the dolores project to its reservation this is critical because the ute mountain tribe must truck water in daily to meet the needs of its 1 400 members the remaining 5 million will be paid in cash to design a project which would serve only indian lands of that reservation moreover a substantial amount of nonindian land is located between the lands of the ute mountain tribe and those of the southern ute indian tribe given these geographic facts it is not surprising that various studies conducted tor the tribes have not revealed any method to deliver water to them and maintain nonindian supplies that is more efficient than the animasla plata project in conclusion the tribal claims cannot be settled without providing additional water supplies to the area as a result it is a critical part of the settlement unfortunately several parties are now arguing that this project will have adverse environmental impacts i believe this settlement recognizes those concerns because the project which is an offchannel storage reservoir was designed to be the least environmentally damaging the animas project will not dam or inundate any stream flows in the animas river during the spring runoff months when water is pumped from the river to a natural basin there will also be minimum flow bypasses at the pumping plant in order to protect the fishery in the animas river some environmental groups feel the project is too power intensive and wasteful because of the pumping required to lift water into ridges basin reservoir they raise the argument that the project is power intensive may be true but the argument that the project utilizes an offchannel reservoir in order to avoid the negative impacts of damming the animas river upstream of durango and having a gravity flow system that was the tradeoff for not damming the animas river canyon as was originally contemplated the pumping plant will be built within the city limits of durango co near the parking lot of a warehouse if you walked about 800 yards up a slope from the parking lot you would be standing in a natural treeless basin crisscrossed with dirt roads the area has never been managed as a wildlife habitat or used for any purpose on the contrary for the last 20 years it has been reserved for use as a storage reservoir once completed the state of colorado will manage the ridges basin area as a recreation area and as a wildlife management area accusations about salinity are also exaggerated while it may be true that colorado is behind on its salinity control program it is behind because there has been little commitment to fund the salinity control projects which congress authorized each year i must go to the appropriations committee to request additional funding to ensure western states do not fall further behind in their efforts to supply clean water to their neighbors my friends must also know that any water project from a small agricultural diversion on private property to a federal reclamation project increases salinity in the river it is an unavoidable consequence of water development the animas river is not one of the last free flowing rivers in the west the stretch of the animas river we are discussing here runs directly through the city of durango co most of the river runs adjacent to private lands farmers and ranchers throughout the area draw upon it daily which is exactly why this bill must be passed any argument that this project will harm the rafting industry in the area is not viable because the river is not a premier white water experience but rather a half day takethefamily sort of mild river float the bureau of reclamation and the sponsoring water districts are attempting to negotiate a contractual agreement on the release of water into the river from the reservoir to preserve adequate flows to support the existing rafting industry all environmental laws the national environmental policy act nepal and the endangered species act have been complied with adverse impacts will be mitigated pursuant to section 8 of the colorado river storage projects act since the introduction of the bill all the controversy surrounding this bill has been focused on one issue whether the law of the river allows the outofstate leasing of colorado river water by indian tribes or if the tribes should be specifically prohibited from leasing in this bill i am glad to say that all seven of the colorado river basin states have come to an agreement on legislative language that will protect their interests at the appropriate time i will offer an amendmemt and an explanation of the leasing controversy and how my amendments will resolve the controversy the most outstanding feature of the project is its ability to resolve the differences of many different constituencies in a peaceful cooperative manner settlement implementation by congress will mean water supplies for the tribes as well as the nonindian water users lengthy and expensive litigation will surely result in the drying up of nonindian lands in southwestern colorado and northern new mexico without a true commitment to provide water to reservations that were promised water 120 years ago the tribes of southwestern colorado and northern new mexico would not be a party to this agreement i hope you will join me in voting to pass this important bill"], [0.4900650978088379,

authorization bill in a spirit of compromise and bipartisanship with the house and senate armed services committee conferees these issues were resolved to the general satisfaction of the house foreign atfairs committee conferees o particular special interest to the foreign affairs committee was the cascelbroomfield july i14 1988 i115736 amendment dealing with the onsite inspection agency purview which is authorized by the foreign affairs committee under the arms control and disarmament act the arms control and disarmament agency is charged as reflected in section 2 with the formulation and implementation of united states arms control and disarmament policy in a manner which will promote the national security as defined in the act the terms arms control and disarmament mean the identification verification inspection limitation control reduction or elimination of armed forces and armaments of all kinds under international agreement to establish an effective system of international control as reflected in section 3 of the arms control and disarmament act as such it is clear that primary jurisdiction over osia exists within the foreign affairs committee accordingly the fiscal year 1989 defense authorization bill includes comporomise language requiring that any authorization of appropriations for the onsite inspection agency shall be submitted as a separate activity this conference compromise is intended to enhance the foreign affairs committee and other committees to fulfill their jurisdiction and oversight obligations and responsibilities the annual budget request to congress shall also include details of all funding and military and civilian personnel requested for osia including the number of personnel from all agencies assigned to osia the conference compromise requires the submission of a report to the relevant committees of the congress from the secretary of defense the secretary of state the director of central intelligence and the director of the united states arms control and disarmament agency on the onsite inspection agency each report shall describe the responsibility each officer has with respect to onsite inspections and the organizational elements of each department or agency relative to functions related to monitoring or verification of arms control agreements more specifically each report shall first describe in detail the monitoring and verification activities carried out with respect to the inf treaty second evaluate the effectiveness with whi h these functions have been implemented and third include recommendations for any future organizational or policy changes that may be necessary in view of the experience of implementing the inf treaty as far as the foreign affairs committee is concerned the committee will have responsibility for osia to the extent that osia sets overall verification and arms control policy implements unitedstates verification policy and establishes guidelines for monitoring escorting and collection activities the foreign affairs committee looks forward to working with the armed services committee and other relevant congressional committees of jurisdiction as we manage the activities of the onsite inspection agency the foreign policy and arms control implications of the administrations binary chemical weapons production proposals represent another issue of special interest to the foreign affairs committee as to be expected in a conference bill the binary chemical weapons provisions contained in the dod conference authorization bill for fiscal year 1989 represent a compromise between the house and senate positions and between proponents and opponents of the binary chemical weapons production program the housesenate compromise reached in conference on the department of defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1989 assures that there will again be no production of the bigeye binary nerve gas bomb this year the bottomline judgment by both the house and the senate was that this new binary chemical weapon is far from ready for production and is still plagued with testing reliability problems accordingly the conferees stipulated that the bigeye bomb must prove itself productionworthy both to the general accounting office gao and the pentagons office of operational test and evaluation before any future funds can be authorized by congress to be spent on this multibillion dollar program funds both prioryear funds released by a presidential certification and a small amount of fiscal year 1989 funds 15 million of 99 million requested can be used only for purposes related to the continued testing program for the blgeye bomb more testing is absolutely necessary if this bomb is ever to prove itself ready for even lowrate initial production the conference language specifically prohibits lowrate initial production and final assembly before positive certifications by the gao and dods office of operational test and evaluation a firm line between testing and production was deemed prudent and wise due to the experience with other weapons systems such as divad where billions of dollars were wasted in production because an illprepared weapon system was allowed to slip into production before proper complete and successful performance in developmental and operational testing the operational test and evaluation office at the pentagon was established partially by pressure from the congress to stop exactly this kind of waste and counterproductive defense spending i regret that the conference compromise has added 45 9 million in expenditures for the production of the 155 mm binary artillery shell when the house bill has basically zeroed out the fiscal year 1989 production request based on sound technical and policy objections the compelling argument against the expenditure of this 45 9 million is that if and when the binary chemical artillery shells are produced they cannot be based in europe where they are needed because our allies will not accept them we already have a chemical deterrent in europe we should not unilaterally withdraw that capability and replace it with nothing as is currently being pursued by the executive branch i continue to have grave reservations about the advisability of the entire binary chemical weapons program my concern focuses primarily on the current potential for significant movement in the arms control area on chemical weapons for example the multilateral negotiations in geneva continue to register progress the soviets have announced a moratorium on their production of chemcial weapons the soviets have made important concessions on inspection and verification of a chemical arms agreement and finally other countries threaten future use of chemical weapons as graphically demonstrated in the iraniraq war we should not trade an arms control opportunity for launching a new production program of binary chemical weapons that do not work and that cannot serve as a deterrent as long as they are based in the united states rather than in europe our efforts should be directed toward the mutual elimination of chemical nerve gas weapons via arms control agreement with the soviets as opposed to the defense departments persistence in encouraging the united states to produce a new generation of unproven costly and counterproductive nerve gas weapons accordingly it is gratifying to note that the conference language explicity prohibits the production of the bigeye binary chemical bomb"], [0.4904059171676636, 0.5095940828323364, 1, "i rise today in support of the bill h r 2941 the catastrophic protection act of 1987 as a cosponsor of senator peppers bill h r 65 the catastrophic health insurance act of 1987 i am very much in support of efforts to provide older americans with comprehensive catastrophic health care coverage while h r 2941 is not as extensive as h r 65 it is a beginning from this beginning it is my hope that we will build a truly comprehensive plan to protect our senior citizens from the devastating costs of catastrophic health care while the controversy surrounding the cost of such a plan prohibits such a big step initially such a plan is an extremely important goal i applaud the senator for his great efforts in this regard and will continue to work with him to make this goal a reality catastrophic health care costs faced by the elderly have been an issue of growing concern over the last several years despite the assistance provided by medicare and medicaid outofpocket health care expenses for the elderly have skyrocketed in 1977 outofpocket health care expenditures by the elderly totaled 12 7 billion by 1984 they had reached 30 2 billion representing a 138percent increase in 7 short years a recent study has shown that married couples over age 65 averaged about 3 000 in outofpocket health care costs in 1986 the problem is by no means confined to the elderly presently about 37 million people lack any health insurance at allalmost all of whom are below age 65 however while there is still debate about the proper role of government in providing health care for the population in general health care for the elderly has been recognized as a federal responsibility since the medicare program was established in 1965 the rapidly increasing outofpocket health care costs being faced by the elderly have a number of causes increases in the costsharing requirements of medicare in recent years rapid escalation in the costs of prescription drugswhich are not presently covered by medicare at all charges by doctors in excess of the amounts recognized by medicare charges which must be paid entirely by the patients themselves and increases in the number of elderly people in nursing homesespecially since medicare pays only a small fraction of nursing home costs while medicaid only provides for the very poor medicare was enacted in 1965 because of the escalating cost of health care encountered by the elderly at that time the elderly were spending 15 percent of their income on health care and yet in 1986 despite the existence of medicare the elderly were spending 16 percent of their income on health care moreover it is projected that under current law this percentage will rise to 18 5 percent by while many of the elderly have medigap insurance policies to supplement their medicare coverage and to protect them from rising outofpocket health care expenses private insurance policies paid only 8 7 billionroughly 7 percentof the elderlys total health care bill in 1984 in addition approximately 20 percent of medicare enrollees have neither medigap nor medicaid coverage to supplement medicare the cost of prescription drugs is also a matter of concern with no medicare and virtually no private insurance coverage almost all prescription drug costs are paid for by the elderly outofpocket according to estimates by cbo almost 5 million medicare beneficiaries spend more than 400 annually on prescription drugs for this group the average annual cost of medication exceeds 900 in addition the cost of prescription drugs has been rising much faster than inflation in 1986 for example when overall inflation was only 1 9 percent the price of prescription drugs rose 8 6 percent finally outofpocket expenditures by the elderly on nursing home care have also beeri escalating rapidlyrising by 139 percent between 1977 and 1984 by 1984 42 percent of all outofpocket health care spending by the elderly went for nursing home care nursing home stays account for 80 percent of the expenses incurred by persons over 65 who have very high outofpocket medical costsmore than 2 000 per year h r 2491 is designed to plug some of the gaps in medicare coverage that have left the elderly spending as much of their income on health care as they did when the medicare program was established this measure protects medicare beneficiaries from catastrophic hospital and physician expenses creates a prescription drug benefit and a respite care benefit under the medicare program and requires states to pay medicares cost sharing requirements for indigent elderly and disabled americans the bill places an overall limit on beneficiaries outofpocket expenditures for services covered by medicare including hospitalization doctors services other outpatient care and limited stays in skilled nursing facilities in 1989 the first year when all provisions will be fully in effect the overall limit would be 1 798 in subsequent years the limits will be adjusted for inflation key provisions of the bill designed to contain outofpocket costs eliminate the limit on the number of days of hospitalization covered end cost sharing requirements for lengthy hospital stays limit cost sharing for doctors services and increase the number of days of skilled nursing facility care covered by medicare the bill extends for the first time medicare coverage to some prescription drug costs under the new benefit once a beneficiary has incurred 500 in prescription drug costs in a calendar year medicare would pay 80 percent of additional costs in addition the bill improves medicaid benefits by requiring the state medicaid programs to pay medicare premiums and costsharing for all medicare enrollees with incomes below the federal poverty line and by protecting the income and assets of the spouses of medicaideligible nursing home residents the expanded medicare benefits would be financed entirely by medicare beneficiaries themselves two mechanisms are used an increase in the existing premium for coverage under medicare part b which covers physicians services and other outpatient care and a new supplemental premium that would be related to income and administered through the income tax system increases in the part b premium would begin in 1989 when the estimated premium would rise from 22 90 per month under current law to 25 50 under the bill the new incomerelated supplemental premium would begin in 1988 when it would range from 10 to 580 per year the supplemental premium would be paid only by medicare enrollees with incomes high enough to incur income tax liabilitiesabout 40 percent of all beneficiaries it is important to note that this increased cost would be at least somewhat offset by the amount these beneficiaries would save by not purchasing medigap insurancewhich should no longer be necessary due to the outofpocket cost limits created by the bill i applaud the efforts of chairman dingell of the energy and commerce committee chairman waxman of the subcommittee on health and environment chairman rostenkowski of the ways and means committee and chairman stark of the subcommittee on health in bringing this measure before us today all of the members of the energy and commerce and ways and means committees worked diligently on this effort this effortwhile not as extensive as i would have likedis a good beginning in this vein it is my hope that we will proceed from here to address the devastating cost of nursing home care to both the medicare recipient and his or her spouse i am sure we all agree that it is paramount that we address this the single largest factor which contributes to the financial devastation connected with health care costs while h r 2941 is a good beginning our effort will not be complete until we can address longterm health

my neighbor the gentleman from new mexico for the leadership they have provided in crafting this bill i also want to commend the staff of the committee for a job well done this bill provides 15 385 729 000 in new budget authority for the department of the treasury the unitedstates postal service the executive office of the president the general services administration the office of personnel management and related agencies the amount is 1 577 billion over the fiscal year 1987 level and 779 million over the administrations request the bill is within the allocations provided for by the congressional budget resolution although i am sure many of you will argue with those figures and may seek cuts i would ask that you first consider what is funded in this bill this bill provides the necessary funding for some very crucial operations of government the programs contained in this bill are not as exciting as those contained in some of the other appropriations bills but they are at least as important if not more it is really a question of which came first the chicken or the egg well you cannot gef one without the other and in the case of government you cannot get the other programs without the functions of the agencies contained in this bill this bill provides funding for the internal revenue service the customs service and the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms which this congress assumes will raise virtually all of the 933 billion in fiscal year 1988 in to pay for 90 percent of government the committee approved the presidents request for the irs and then added 58 million based upon the assumptions made in the budget resolution that increased collection would result in lower deficits the committee provided 160 million more than the president requested for the customs service rather than cut the 2 000 personnel proposed in his budget had we acquiesced to the president on this matter not only would we have lost revenues from tariffs and duties but we also would have reversed the position taken by the 99th congress to fight the war on drugs instead the committee under the wise leadership of the chairman added 800 new positions on top of the current level furthermore we included a legislative floor to ensure that the customs service will hire and maintain those positions and the committee provided an additional 21 million to the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to ensure efficient collection of revenues from sales of these products as well as the enforcement of our weapons and explosives laws and alcohol and tobacco regulations now given that we have tried to provide the necessary funding to collect nearly all of 90 percent of revenues assumed by the fiscal year 1988 congressional budget resolution congress assumes that the other 10 percent will be raised through the issuance of debt obligations in the credit markets so that we may meet our commitments to defense international security education health and the public wellbeing this bill provides for the funds necessary to operate the treasury which is responsible for printing and minting our currency and issuing bills notes and bonds to finance the day to day operations of the federal government while not as a glamorous as the court of st james or as exciting as sac headquarters in omaha this bill provides the necessary funding for the operations of the financial management service the mint the bureau of engraving and printing the bureau of public debt and the unitedstates savings bonds division these are the financial agents of the unitedstates government under the leadership of the secretary of the treasury and before anyone starts to demagogue about the bureau of the public debt try to remember first how the government finances its operations we do not simply raise revenues from taxes and pay our bills instead we have complex mechanism of issuing bills notes and bonds in anticipation of revenues in order to ensure a smooth operation of government revenues are then used to retire these obligations these financial instruments are the cornerstone of the worlds financial markets to take the knife to these agencies ignoring such factors would be illadvised this bill contains the funding for the secret service and the federal law enforcement training center these are important functions of governmentto protect important federal and foreign officials combat currency counterfeiting and train federal law enforcement officers a nation cannot conduct its affairs if it cannot ensure the safety of its top officials official foreign guests and diplomats and the protection of its entities this bill also contains the funding for the general services administration and the office of personnel management in order that we might determine whether to lease public lands for oil exploration protect the caribou in alaska or develop the strategic defense initiative we need manpower and a physical plant you simply cannot run a successful organization if you do not provide the necessary capital investment in the case of government that is investment in human capital potential and the physical plant for all of those who say we can cut government expenditures and thus the deficit through increased productivity and efficiency must realize that cutting back the workspace and management of our employees the federal work force who by the way are american citizens too will result in less not more productivity and efficiency this bill also contains the funding for the executive office of the president that means everything from the presidents salary and residence to the national security council to omb to the council of economic advisers the committee provided the full amount requested by the president and an additional 172 000 to the national critical materials council for additional positions for research and development as mandated by law i do not believe i need to explain to the members the importance of the executive office of the president and i believe the committee has acted fairly in providing the request finally the bill provides 556 million for the payment of the federal liability stemming from the old post office department and for the revenue forgone subsidy the administration had requested only 72 million to provide for the liability and free mail for the blind the committee acquiesced to the will of the congress as assumed by the congressional budget resolution which provided for the maintenance of current rates for free and reduced rate mailers this program provides for free and reduced rate mail for the blind nonprofit organizations schools and libraries and incounty rural newspapers it is something that the congress has said it believes is necessary and therefore the committee has provided funding the committee has crafted a fair bill which is under our budget allocation and provides for the smooth operation of government make no mistake about it without the

the functions this bill provides if you want to cut the deficit dont vote to cut the irs the batf or the customs service if you want to ensure the efficient operation of government dont cut the

support of the amendment as chairman of the select committee on narcotics abuse and control i am concerned that the necessary manpower and resources are dedicated to combatting the influx of illicit drug into this country therefore i am pleased to support the amendment of the gentleman from florida mr bennett which expands the role of the military in the war against drug trafficking the relationship between civilian and military in our nation has been a carefully constructed one in 1878 the congress enacted legislation making it unlawful to employ any part of the army of the united states as a posse comitatus or otherwise for the purpose of executing laws except where such employment was authorized by the constitution or act of congress on occasion congress has acted to authorize exceptions to the posse comitatus law to allow the military to assist in civilian law enforcement because of the serious threat posed to this country by drug trafficking and illicit narcotics in 1981 the congress passed the socalled posse comitatus amendments these amendments were intended to give the military clear authority to assist civilian drug law enforcement agencies while assuring that no impairment would occur in our military readiness the 1981 amendments permit the military to assist civilian law enforcement agencies by sharing information collected during the normal course of military operations military equipment and facilities it also allows the military to provide training and technical assistance to civilian agencies furthermore in certain limited circumstances the military is permitted to operate and maintain equipment loaned to federal drug enforcement agencies drug enforcement agencies and the military services have both indicated to the select committee that the 1981 amendments have had a very positive effect in increasing military cooperation with civilian drug enforcement the 1981 amendments have permitted the military to make an important contribution to our narcotics suppression efforts in support of the civilian agencies that have the primary responsibility for drug enforcement and interdiction missions most recently under the antidrug abuse act of 1986 the military has been authorized to provide a wide range of equipment to the drug enforcement and interdiction agencies bringing their resources into the 1980s they have made available four blackhawk helicopters to the customs service and four e2c radar equipped aircraft two customs and two to coast guard they are in the process of providing aerostats to the customs service which will be used to close the window of vulnerability along the southwest border the coast guard has also been placing law enforcement teams aboard navy ships to board suspected smuggling vessels when they are encountered and make any arrests searches and seizures necessary the antidrug abuse act gave the coast guard permanent authority for such placements and authorized 500 positions to support these missions unfortunately despite the increased cooperation from the military the situation with respect to drug trafficking as we find it today is worse than ever narcotics smugglers continue to inundate our shores with increasing quantities of illegal drugs the select committee estimates that 178 tons of cocaine were directed at the united states in 1986 as compared to 188 tons in 1984 in 1986 12 tons of heroin entered the united states despite intensified efforts 30 000 to 60 000 tons of marijuana are still being smuggled into the united states annually and the future does not bode well the state department indicates in its recently released international narcotics control strategy report bumper crops in every major drug producing country the volume of illicit drugs destined for the united states each year simply overwhelms our civilian agencies that do not have the resources to interdict more than 5 to 10 percent of this illicit traffic in the face of this continued and growing threat from drug smuggling there have been renewed calls both within and outside the congress for an expanded military role in drug law enforcement clearly a stronger commitment to narcotics enforcement is needed to deter and disrupt the illicit drug trade illegal drugs are responsible for billions of dollars in crime each year and bring untold misery suffering and death to communities throughout the nation moreover the unauthorized penetrations of our borders constitute a grave threat to our national security last year president reagan issued a national security directive which defined drug trafficking as a threat to our national security the amendment under consideration today attempts to respond to the drug trafficking problem in a reasonable way that recognizes the gravity of the situation but also recognizes the primary military mission of the armed froces and the need to maintain civilian control over law enforcement oeprations the amendment would expand the militarys role in drug enforcement by permitting military personnel to assist federal drug enforcement officials in drug searches seizures and arrests subject to a number of important restrictions first military assistance in drug searches seizures and arrests could take place onlyand i want to emphasize onlyoutside the land areas of the united states and it territories the amendment in no way authorizes the military to engage in domestic searches and seizures which i strongly oppose second the attorney general would be required to verify that a drug enforcement operation for which such military assistance is required may not succeed without the support of the armed services third military assistance must be approved by the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the secretary of state finally the amendment would require federal drug enforcement officials to maintain ultimate control over the activities and direction of any drug enforcement operation the primary intent of this amendment is to permit the navy when requested to assist our drug enforcement efforts by interdicting maritime drug smugglers at present navy vessels on routine patrols and training missions report suspect vessel sightings and other information they gather on possible drug smuggling vessels to the coast guard coast guard boarding teams ledets frequently sail on board navy vessels operating in areas of smuggling activity if a smuggling vessel is sighted the navy ship flying a coast guard flag will interdict it so the coast guard unit can board search for and seize drugs and make arrests the amendment under consideration would simply allow the navy to conduct the searches seizures and arrests in such situations this would eliminate the legal fiction presently used to permit naval involvement in direct drug interdiction operations it would buttress our resources against drug smuggling and put drug traffickers on notice that any time they see a navy vessel they might be boarded the select committee has been reviewing the militarys role in drug enforcement to determine how the support provided by the military to our civilian agencies can be increased without impairing military readiness or derogating civilian responsibility for law enforcement i believe the gentlemans amendment meets these objectives and can provide some immediate and sorely needed support to our inter diction efforts particularly maritime interdiction i am confident that the responsible manner in which the 1981 amendments have been implemented coupled with the safeguards included in the present amendment justify this proposed expansion of the militarys role in drug interdiction this amendment is by no means a total solution to the serious problem of illicit drug trafficking but it is an important step that we can and should take now i am pleased to add my support to this measure and i commend the gentleman from florida for his leadership in bringing it forward at this time i urge the house to approve it"], [0.49081486463546753, 0.5091851353645325, 1, "on october 28 the federal government will be awarding the federal energy efficiency award and since

region 5 which has a solar system this solar system provides heating cooling and preheats domestic hot water for the building occupants the system is a totally hydronic system which incorporates 6 700 square feet of evacuated tube collectors comprising 5 200 individual tubes this system was designed in 1977 mr quinlan has maintained the solar system in an excellent state of repair and has operated it in a highly efficient manner he is the only operating individual at this building this facility is located approximately 160 miles from the director of facilities in springfield illinois the biggest obstacle to the efficient operation of this type of solar system is leaks within the solar collector tubes the presence of leaks within the solar array results in air entering the system and chemically treated water leaving the system air within the system reduces heat transfer and could result in air pockets which could cause the solar collector tubes to break water leaking from the tubes results in increased water and chemical consumption the chemicals are used for corrosion control of the piping associated with the solar system mr quinlan has made a conscientious effort to eliminate leaks from the solar system by replacing leaking headers in the solar array and maintaining the solar tube seals in good condition maintaining the solar array is a time consuming task which requires great effort mr quinlan accomplished this feat while simultaneously providing excellent service to the building tenants mr quinlan also investigated and solved a problem with interlocks on the solar water circulating pumps for the rapid heat up control system the rapid heat up system is used to heat the water in the solar collector water storage tanks prior to correcting the problem with the interlocks the rapid heat up system did not work and the building was heated with the electric boiler instead of the solar collector tanks after the interlock problem was solved by mr quinlan the electric boiler was used less frequently approximately 75 percent of the buildings heating and cooling requirements are now being met by energy from the sun in accordance with the system design before mr quinlan came to this building only approximately 25 percent of these requirements were provided by solar energy additionally mr quinlan recallbrated all of the buildings pneumatic and electronic controls for the heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac system this action enhanced the ability of the solar system to provide heating and cooling to the building this action also enabled the hvac system to provide a comfortable environment for the tenants while simultaneously keeping the temperatures in accordance with gsas temperature guidelines mr quinlan also installed light controllers which activate or deactivate the light in the buildings four toilet rooms based on occupancy degree to which nominee got others actively involved mr quinlan is the only gsa representative assigned to this building he got the tenants involved in the energy conservation program to help him reduce the buildings energy consumption he has received their cooperation in turning lights off when they leave their offices mr quinlan also keeps the tenants informed about energy conservation retrofit projects implemented within the building section 3 project life the energy conservation actions identified in section 2 and their annual savings are expected to stay in effect throughout the lifetime of the installed equipment mr quinlans vigilance and expertise will be required to detect and repair any future leaks which may develop in the solar array throughout the remaining life of the building section 4 transferability the installation of the light controller and the tenant involvement in the energy conservation program described in section 2 can be applied to other public buildings throughout the general services administration and governmentwide those actions dealing with the performance of the solar array may potentially be applied to other buildings which utilize solar energy to heat cool or provide domestic hot water to the building representatives from the veterans administration hospital in marion illinois have met with mr quinlan and toured the federal building in carbondale illinois to observe the operation of the solar system the purpose of their visit was to determine how they could improve the operation of the solar system located at the veterans administration hospital complex in marion illinois thus mr quinlan has demonstrated his willingness to share his knowledge and experience with others to benefit the federal government section 5 innovation the federal building in carbondale illinois is an innovative building it is one of the few public buildings within our nation which obtains energy from the sun to heat cool and preheat domestic hot water therefore because this buildings mechanial systems are so

associated states in micronesia the provisions of the omnibus insular areas act of 1988 are for the most part noncontroversial and with minor exceptions are supported by the administration the island areas affected by this legislation are of three types the first are the territories of the united states which come under the territorial clause of the constitution article iv section 3 clause 2 american samoa guam the northern mariana islands puerto rico and the virgin islands the second type of island group covered by parts of this legislation is palau which the united states administers as the last part of the united nations trust territory of the pacific island the trusteeship agreement provides the united states with the authority and responsibility for the political economic and social development of the people of palau with the passage of the palau compact of free association in 1986 and soon the implementing legislation the united states will discharge its responsibility as administering authority and although palaus new relationship under the compact appears imminent the united states continues to be fully responsible for palau and third there are certain sovereign island states which are in free association with the united states they are the republic of the marshall islands and the federated states of micronesia while these two are currently the only states in free association with the united states palau will become the third freely association state when the compact of free association becomes effective which hopefully will be soon essential air service to the freely associated states is important to the relationship between the united states and the marshall islands and the freely associated states of micronesia section 3 of the bill does not require an outlay of any additional funds it does extend the current essential air service law which will expire this month if this provision does not become law in addition to the positive impact on our relationship with the island a continuation of essential air service will be very important to the unitedstates civilian and military personnel working at the kwajalein missile testing facility in the marshall islands an additional 2 000 people are expected to work on kwajalein in the coming years although the people there do rely on military transport for the movement of personnel and supplies regularly scheduled commercial service will be very helpful to the base people mail and goods need to flow in and out of kwajalein the guarantee of essential air service by commercial airlines may preclude an increase of military cargo and passenger flights and thereby produce a savings to the unitedstates government this provision will benefit the united states by improving our relations with the islands meeting a growing need of strategic interests and saving money on transportation requirements best met by the private sector i want to acknowledge the deep interest and involvement of supreme court justice anthony m kennedy in the development of the provisions regarding judicial matters in the pacific islands justice kennedy headed a pacific islands judicial conference in american samoa which dealt with specific judicial issues in the islands i am pleased that we have a supreme court justice that is intimately familiar with the islands and their special judicial needs the provision dealing with judicial matters is intended to enable judges of the ninth judicial circuit to serve as judges of the courts of the freely associated states this type of assistance has been provided to the courts of the merging freely associated state governments by judges from the courts of unitedstates jurisdictions in the region over the years and has proven valuable to these governments during the transition from trusteeship to selfgovernment however the process for making unitedstates judges available to the freely associated states in the posttrusteeship period may not be identical to the process for providing such assistance previously because of the new status of the freely associated states as sovereign and selfgoverning both the united states and freely associated state governments may have to adopt new procedures to ensure that in making arrangements for this type of judicial assistance their respective constitutional processes are observed this provision creates authority for judicial assistance but recognizes that appropriate procedures including treaty arrangements if determined to be necessary will have to be decided upon as this provision is implemented consultations between the judicial and foreign policy elements of our government should be undertaken to ensure that this provision is implemented with due regard for the political and legal distinctions between a freely associated state and a unitedstates territory or commonwealth another provision which poses no cost to the united states is the section regarding controlled substance in the freely associated states the general health needs of the people of the freely associated states could be improved by providing qualified medical olficers in the islands

purpose of explaining ifiy amendment which is made in order by the rule for m r 1467 i first want to state that under no circumstances does my amendment delay or lessen the need for the epa to fulfill their responsibilities under the endangered species act specifically the amendment will not delay the implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program however following several meetings with this member and others epa has already committed publicly to providing farmers ranchers foresters and the states with the necessary time needed to smoothly implement the program and in order to make that program work we should assist in that commitment the intent of my amendment is to offer clarity formality and workability to the endangered species pesticides labeling program and ultimately to maximize the acceptance of the program by affected user groups and pesticide applicators first off the amendment provides that epa in cooperation with usda and the department of the interior will promptly engage in a program to inform and educate persons affected by the labeling program including a requirement that the essential elements of the program be published in the federal register second the amendment requires an economic assessment of the programs impact and expected benefits as well as the study and investigation of the development and implementation of the program finally the amendment requires two reports which will include recommendations for changes and improvements the problem with this program is not the desire and need to comply with the endangered species act it is the manner in which the program has been developed and is to be implemented without due consideration to alternative methods of compliance my amendment will encourage sensitivity to the needs of production agriculture and the development of acceptance alternatives for complying with the esa the first part of my amendment calls for a program to educate and to make available information for persons engaged in the production of food and fiber that are and may be affected by the environmental protection agencys endangered species pesticides labeling program this program to educate and inform will be conducted jointly by epas administrator the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of interior since the endangered species pesticides labeling program is the responsibility of epa the responsibility to dedicate resources and effort to the development of the education and information program should be on that agency however the unitedstates department of the interior and the unitedstates department of agriculture have unique resources and talents that can assist greatly in the development and implementation of the education effort i would expect in particular that the department of agriculture could contribute greatly due to its naturally extensive relationship to the agriculture community and other affected pesticide users for this program to work we must indicate in a timely way impending events related to the endangered species pesticides labeling program for this reason and to reduce the level of uncertainty among affected and potentially affected pesticide users commodity producers and landowners the provision requiring notice in the federal register was included epa should promptly publish in the federal register accurate detailed information regarding the affected pesticides under the endangered species pesticides labeling program as well the restrictions imposed on the user or applicator a geographical identification of the prohibition or restriction to include a listing of impacted counties and unless determined otherwise by the secretary of interior a subcounty description of the restrictions or prohibitions and identification of the relevant of endangered or threatened species obviously if these restrictions are to work they should be published prior to their implementation the amendment calls for the administrator of epa jointly with the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of interior to jointly conduct investigations and studies of the development and implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program of particular interest is the translation of biological data and jeopardy decisions rendered by the department of the interior into pesticide restrictions by epa and their ultimate implementation one of the most crucial aspects of the amendment is the requirement of a study of the economic impact and anticipated benefits the epa has provided no information regarding actual expected or potential economic impacts of the endangered species pesticides labeling program without this kind of information it is impossible for this congress or other federal agencies to lessen any economic blow this program may generate it is my hope that we may be able to modify or expand existing programs administered by the department of agriculture or the department of the interior or epa so that adversely affected pesticide users and landowners in particular can accommodate the impending necessary pesticide changes for example the conservation reserve program may be expanded to prioritize enrollment of affected landowners or perhaps affected lands could be prioritized for acquisition by federal land management agencies these and certainly many other ideas should be explored and evaluated for their merits specific items that the study on economic impacts should examine include the increase in affected industry and user costs production losses changes in valuation of affected range lands pasturelands timberlandsand timber or crop lands that may result due to increased risks costs and losses in production as a result of imposed pesticide restrictions furthermore the economic impact study should examine the costs states will incur or can expect to incur if they should customize epas endangered species pesticides labeling program to their own special needs also epa the department of agriculture and department of the interior should indicate the costs attendent to developing and implementing the program as well as the costs that epas program will impose upon their operations there is also a requirement to study and report on the benefits derived from the implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program the study of benefits should focus on those benefits expected to accrue to the recovery of endangered and threatened species we should not expect the department of the interior or any other agency to attempt to quantify the economic benefits or value of protecting endangered species but some attempt should be made to examine document and explain what benefits the endangered species pesticides labeling program will generate the epa has consistently indicated that the rationale for imposing the new pesticide restrictions are driven by legal vulnerabilities we should instead justify the program on the basis of advancing and protecting endangered or threatened species the epa the department of agriculture and the department of the interior shall conduct an investigation into the fundamental processes by which the endangered species pesticides labeling program was developed and implemented the accuracy and validity of the county bulletin maps which designate the geographical locations of the pesticide restrictions also need study and improvement special attention should be given to the extent that the maps which detail the locations of the restrictions fully conform to the habitat of the endangered and threatened species the maps should not include territory beyond the area of the habitat of the endangered or threatened species requiring explicit protection from exposure to pesticide applications simply for the purpose of administrative convenience the amendment also requires an investigation into alternative courses of action initiatives that epa has implemented or should consider a flaw in the development and implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program is the lack of attention and resources provided for the consideration and development of alternative methods of compliance many pesticide labels provide a range of application rates for a particular crop to treat a certain type of infestation the decisions rendered by the department of the interior regarding the level of risk posed by a pesticide do not attempt to find the threshold of exposure that poses an acceptable risk as the agency responsible for regulating pesticides epa should work with the department of the interior and the department of agriculture to investigate alternative methods of restricting pesticide applications such alternatives may include consideration of banded versus broadcast applications reduced rates of application temporal restrictions and also reconsideration of the assumptions used to render decisions regarding the level of risk posed by the relevant pesticides the epa the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of interior shall submit two reports regarding the results of their studies and recommendations congress will anticipate receipt of the first interim report on january 1 1989 and the final report will be due january 1 1990 these reports should address all elements of their investigations as well as the inclusion of recommendations to modify and improve programs to make more efficient the implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program my amendment is a fair amendment under no interpretation can the required reports be construed to mandate a delay in the implementation of the endangered species labeling program the intent of the studies investigations and subsequent reports is to strengthen the endangered species pesticides labeling program with input from outside of the epa and to encourage more flexibility and creativity under current law only the administrator of the epa has the authority to delay and or allow for flexibility in the implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program this amendment will provide the information and support needed to intelligently administer the pesticides labeling program i urge the adoption of this amendment"], [0.5090063810348511, 0.5090063810348511, 0, "i rise in support of h r 5315 as amended which will

of youth leadership in the areas of public service personal development and physical fitness the award has given new direction and meaning to the lives of the young americans who have received it it is a program that has had the support of many members of congress and local community leaders the program is administered by the congressional award board which has the authority to use the congressional seal but the programs activities are not directed by congress while the program has achieved substantial success at the local level the national board which administers the program nationwide has not the board is composed of 22 wellintentioned and hard working members who are committed to the program but unfortunately they have not been able to achieve an acceptable level of success nationally since 1979 only 48 local congressional award councils have been established and in a survey conducted by the subcommittee on select education only 28 percent of congressional officers who responded participated in the program and 71 percent had never heard of the congressional award program when the program was established the congress intended that it be funded and operated through private sources however while local and state councils have been extremely successful in raising funds to operate the program at the local level the national board has not in 1987 the board had to request federal funds because their fundraising efforts had not yielded enough money to run the program congress appropriated 189 000 in unauthorized dollars to the congressional award board in order for the administration of the program to continue due to this financial crisis the gao examined the financial position of the congressional award program and testified before the subcommittee on select education on june 28 1988 the gao found the foundation has suffered losses from operations in 3 of the past 4 years its revenue from contributions decreased from 907 225 in 1984 to 204 379 in 1987 as of december 31 1987 the foundation had a net deficit of 322 995 the foundation has not raised any funds during the first 4 months of 1988 the foundation is operating solely on an appropriation of 189 000 these facts raise substantial doubt concerning the entitys ability to continue as a going concern since that testimony 300 000 of the outstanding debt has been forgiven and the board is attempting to retire the remaining 22 995 however due to the financial instability of the national board the subcommittee on select education believed that the board must meet certain mandates in order for the program to continue in trying to continue this program for the benefit of our nations young people many alternatives were discussed including the possibility of an outside organization administering the program on the national level however representatives of the board local congressional award councils and the congressional award alumni association opposed this approach thus the subcommittee agreed to allow the congressional award board continue to administer this program with no federal funds and under certain conditions those conditions are included in this legislation they are first submission of quarterly reports to the committees of jurisdiction during 1989 which describe in detail all fundraising activities conducted by the board a description of the fiscal position of the board as of the date of each report including available cash outstanding debts and prospective operating expenses the number and location of congressional award councils established since the previous report in states or congressional districts where no such councils previously existed and any evidence of contact between the board or the congressional award association with congressional offices second certification by the executive director of the board no later than september 30 1989 to the congressional leadership that the board is meeting its operating expenses has no outstanding debts and has complied with the requirements included in the quarterly reports the gao will verify that the information in the quarterly reports and the certification is accurate if the reports are submitted by the dates required and the certification is given the authorization for the program will continue for another year and may only be revoked or changed by subsequent legislative action if the board fails to issue a quarterly report by the date specified or makes no certification to the leadership that they have met these requirements the

appoint two representatives from local congressional award councils and two representatives from the congressional award alumni association to be members of the board within 120 days after enactment of this legislation this will ensure that the local congressional award councils and alumni of the program who understand it the best contribute their knowledge about the program to the national board

to study the results of the criminal justice subcommittees comprehensive yearlong investigation and exhaustive hearings the criminal justice subcommittee followed hearing procedures designed to encourage judge hastings involvement we listened attentively to opening remarks from judge hastings welcomed the participation of judge hastings and his counsel in the questioning of witnesses and extended an invitation to judge hastingswhich he declinedto testify concerning the events of our inquiry the chairman of the subcommittee the gentleman from michigan and the ranking minority member the gentleman from pennsylvania committed themselves to a thorough fair and objective search for the truth the committees special counsel alan baron and assistant special counsels janice cooper

federal court victories in obtaining access to grand jury and electronic surveillance materials the significance of the judicial opinions extends beyond the investigation of judge hastings the decisions provide important precedents that should facilitate the investigative work of the house of representatives in future impeachment matters the task of examining the conduct of a sitting federal judge is our constitutional responsibility as members of this body when significant allegations of misconduct are brought to our attention article i section 2 clause 5 of the constitution vests the sole power of impeachment in the house of ripresentatives the constitutional design seeks to reconcile the need for judicial independence with the need to preserve the integrity of the federal judiciary the first article of the impeachment resolution charges that judge hastings and william borders engaged in a conspiracy to obtain a bribe in connection with a case pending before judge hastings william borders was convicted of the conspiracy but judge hastings in a separate trial was acquitted the two verdicts clearly are inconsistent the jury in the borders case had to be convinced of judge hastings complicity the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit in its affirmance of borders conviction concluded because only hastings and borders were named as conspirators in the indictment the government had to prove hastings involvement in order to convict borders for conspiracy 693 f 2d 1318 at 1324 11th cir 1982 the fact that the government failed in the hastings trial to prove conspiracythe same conspiracy it succeeded in providing in the borders casedoes not relieve the house of representatives of its obligation in an impeachment inquiry to look at the evidence of conspiracy the constitutional protection again double jeopardywhich bars successive criminal prosecutionshas no application to a process designed to protect the rule of law from unfit judges rather than to impose punishment these proceedings simply do not place judge hastings in jeopardy of life or limb within the meaning of the fifth amendment our constitutional forebears intended to establish an impeachment process separated from the judicial branch of government we cannot consistent with this scheme consider ourselves bound by the outcome of a criminal trial the jurys verdict in my view is entitled to a substantial measure of deferenceand i have accorded it substantial deferencebut that verdict cannot provide a substitute for the independent judgment the constitution requires the house of representatives to exercise our hearings in my view produced clear and convincing evidence that judge hastings participated in a conspiracy to receive a bribe and committed perjury during his trial in order to mislead the jury house resolution 499 describes many knowingly false statements made under oath judge hastings according to clear and convincing evidence engaged in criminal conduct by lying repeatedly during his triala course of conduct that led to his acquittal of conspiracy to commit bribery the fact that an individual succeds through crimes committed at trial in winning an acquittal in a criminal case does not release us from our responsibility to bring before the senate the issue of his removal from public office on the contrary our responsibility to act is heightened by flagrant disregard for the rule of law fourteen separate articles of house resolution 499 delineate lies told by judge hastings during trial testimony these articles document a pervasive pattern of deception that this body must not ignore a trial process that relies on the willingness of witnesses to testify honestly cannot be entrusted to a judge who demonstrates contempt for the truth the house of representatives as the repository of the sole power of impeachment possesses the responsibility to look at the evidence of false testimony in spite of the fact that lies may have been believed by a jury in a bribery conspiracy trialjust as we have the responsibility to look at the evidence of a bribery conspiracy in spite of an acquittal based on false testimony a judge who compounds his misconduct by both conspiring to accept a bribe and repeatedly lying under oath gains no immunity in an impeachment proceeding judge hastings according to clear and convincing evidence sought to sell his judicial office for private gainand later perverted the legal process by testifying falsely such conduct cannot be tolerated in a public official responsible for dispensing equal justice under law the committee on the judiciary also considered allegations that judge hasting improperly disclosed information he received as the supervising judge from a continuing electronic surveillance that he authorized the evidence is clear and convincing that judge hastings in fact made the improper disclosurewith the result that law enforcement undercover operations had to be aborted the lives of some individuals involved in law enforcement efforts may have been placed at risk as a result of judge hastings action this conduct by a federal judge cannot be tolerated and provides a sufficient independent basis for impeachment the federal judiciary is the guardian of our most precious liberties our responsibility is to vigilantly protect the judiciary i urge my

fully realize that current political issues may oftentimes cause tensions between our country and greece the fact remains that we have been loyal allies who share many bonds that must be brought to light so that they may serve as an incentive for the continuation of good relations between these two historic friends march 25 is a day of celebration for those of the greek heritage and greek orthodox faith almost greater than any other day of the year in their religious faith and national history march 25 commemorates the beginning of the greek struggle for independence from over 400 years of ottoman domination it was on march 25 1821 that the socalled greek resistance small battleweary groups of guerrillas known as klephtes embarked on their long and just struggle against the mighty ottoman empire the greek resistance appeared to the world as no match for the power of the turkish military might but the greeks fought with the determination and valor that was the personification of the words of their manifesto of independencereminiscent of the american declaration of independence i might addwhich clearly declared that our tongues which before dared not utter a sound except vain supplications for clemency now cry with a loud voice and make the air reecho with the sweet name of liberty in one word we are unanimously resolved on liberty or death the klephtes were illclad illfed and illequipped but fought valiantly and ferociously for their right to a national identity and won battles from the empire almost from the beginning the justice of the greek cause soon spread and encouraged a movement throughout europe as well as the united states to assist the greeks in their struggle for freedom the last battle of messolongi often referred to as the greek alamo almost more than any other point in the long difficult 6year struggle lustrated the greek will and the justice of the cause at its best messolongi a small fishing village provided the gateway to free accese between the greek mainland and the peloponnese and as such was the heart of the turkish concentration in 1826 the turks brought the full impact of the ottomon might to bear on this little village effectively blockading the town by sea and ringing it with cannon and troops by land on january 27 1826 the turks presented an ultimatum of surrender however this ultimatum was answered not with surrender but tinhesitatingly on the same day with the following response which i quote the capitan pasha is well aware that the greeks have suffered unheard of misfortunes shed streams of blood and seen their towns made deserts and for all this nothing can compensate nothing can indemnify them but liberty and independence the battle for messolongi continued through january february march and most of april with the 15 0c0 turkish troops gaining a foothold on the walls three times only to be hurled back by savage handtohand counterattacks from the 4 000 greeks on the 21st of april the turks again offered the garrison surrender terms but with a caveat that a refusal would seal the doom of all defenders the intrepid spirit which had animated the movement of independence had not diminished even under bombardment disease and starvation the greeks again refused to surrender the following day april 22 saw many acts of heroism by the greeks they fought to the bitter end until there were only 300 men left from the original 4 000 in the garrison these remaining 300 still would not surrender however and sealed themselvt hi a windmill and fought the turks until only a few were left alive then as the turks stormed the mill the greeks set fire to their gunpowder and blew into oblivion the defenders as well as the attackers the following words taken from a letter written by a swiss citizen who perished in the last defense of messolongi was written a few days before his death and shows the spirit which animated the townspeople i quote seventeen hundred and forty of our brothers are dead more than a hundred thousand bombs and balls thrown by the enemy have destroyed our bastions and our houses we have been terribly distressed by hunger and the cold 0 notwithstanding so many privations however it is a great and noble spectacle to witness the ardor and devotedness of the garrison a few days more and these brave men will be angelic spirits 0 i announce you the resolution sworn before heaven to defend foot by foot the land of mensolongi and to bury ourselves without listening to any capitulation under the ruins of the city we are drawing near our final hour history will render us justiceposterity will weep over our misfortunes i am proud to think that the blood of a swiss of a child of william tell is about to mingle wil that of the heroes of greece may the relation of the siege of messolongi which i have written survive me yes it was this kind of will and determination that prevailed among the greeks and philhellenes and eventually led to the sultans conceding of national political independence to the greek revolutionaries after the battle of navarino on october 20 1827 ti11032 the greek war of independence however was not the only time that the greek people have exemplified themselves in 1940 the greeks were handed another ultimatumthis time from mussolini demanding that italian troops be allowed to occupy the greek islands of crete and corfu parts of epirus and the port of pireus the greeks as was the case with the turks again adamantly rejected the ultimatum with a defiant oxi no which is commemorated on october 28 of each year as a result of the greek defiance italian troops moved over the albanian border into greece on the morning of october 28 and were met with unexpectedly stiff resistance the greek troops again valiantly rose to the occasion and blocked the italian attacks time after time until by november 7 the greek army of 5 000 officers and 65 000 men had stopped the italians on the 14th the greeks counterattacked by the 22d not only had all italians been ejected from greek soil but the greek army had taken koritsa the principal italian base and pogradiatwo towns well over the albanian border some think that this unexpectedly fierce greek opposition to the axis invasion of greece may have saved the british forces which were then assembling in the middle east if greece had given way suddenly and hitlers drive into the southern part of the soviet union been made earlier and had been more successfulas well it might havethe two axis powers italy and germany might have crushed them one from the southern part of the soviet union and the other from north africa in a pincer before they were strong enough to resist and so such is the legacy of the greek people to the free world by the example of the sacrifies of these patriots they have hopefully given others the strength to defend the principles founded by our ancestors it was precisely this greek legacy and spirit that prompted president harry

dropouts in school providing assistance to gifted and talented children and improving the performance of students and teachers the major focus on h r 5 is the reauthorization of chapter 1 compensatory education chapter 1 the centerpiece of federal efforts for improving the basic skill needs of educationally disadvantaged children is already a good program the conference report makes it better by including several provisions designed to improve chapter ls effectiveness and help educationally disadvantaged children master gradelevel proficiency the most significant improvement requires chapter 1 schools to meet certain achievement standards and reverse any declining achievement trends if the chapter 1 program shows no significant improvement after 1 year the local school district must provide the necessary technical assistance to bring the program up to par if there is no improvement in achievement rates after 2 years the local school district must work in partnership with the state educational agency to prevent further decline and implement the necessary reforms the program improvement provisions are crucial for ensuring that schools will be accountable for addressing the needs of their educationally disadvantaged students an effective chapter 1 program is also dependent on parental involvement school districts will be required to develop programs activities and procedures to involve parents in the education of their children parents will be directly involved in the planning and implementation of chapter 1 programs introducing innovative concepts in chapter 1 will help to sustain and enhance the programs effectiveness school districts will now be allowed to use up to 5 percent of their chapter 1 grants for innovative projects including incentive payments to schools that have demonstrated success encouraging innovative approaches for parental involvement and fostering community and private sector participation in the program the conference report also recognizes that a correlation exists between low academic achievement and areas with high poverty levels h r 5 includes a concentration grant formula that truly targets additional chapter 1 funding to high poverty school districts where the number of poor children exceeds 6 500 or 15 percent of enrollment two new initiatives are incorporated into chapter 1 first even start and second basic skills improvement and dropout prevention even start will expand chapter 1 services to atrisk children ages 17 and their parents this partnership of early childhood and adult education is based on the understanding that childhood advancements in education are linked to the presence of literate parents at home helping atrisk high school students and keeping them in school is the purpose of the basic skills improvement and dropout prevention program this program provides much needed basic skills services to educationally deprived secondary students helps to keep students from dropping out of school and encourages those who have dropped out to return and finish school the conference report wisely maintains the block grant approach of the chapter 2 program this school improvement program gives states and local school districts the flexibility to meet changing educational needssomething which they could not achieve through numerous small categorical programs local school districts may use their chapter 2 funds to improve education in several broad areas including programs for atrisk children gifted and talented children teacher training and effective schools several improvements are made in the math and science teacher training program under the conference report the current program has been ineffective because of hampering setasides and reporting requirements h r 5 streamlines the present program by limiting funding to math and science teacher training thus eliminating funding for computer learning and foreign language instruction the conference report channels an overwhelming majority of funding to local school districts ensuring that enough funding will be available to operate effective teacher training programs in cases where school districts receive small grants they may apply for funding in a consortium with other school districts or higher education institutions this provision which is a variation of an amendment i offered in committee and was included in the original house bill helps to put viable teacher training programs in place the conference agreement also sets aside 4 percent of the overall appropriation for the secretarys discretionary fund to conduct national programs although an original draft of the math and science program eliminated the secretarys discretionary fund i felt that such a setaside was needed the committee eventually adopted my view that this relatively new program needed direction at the federal level to determine what works in math and science teacher training the secretary will award grants for programs of national significance in math and science instruction and disseminate information about exemplary national programs to state educational agencies school districts and higher education institutions the most positive and unexpected changes in h r 5 are probably made in bilingual education as an original sponsor of legislation which would give school districts greater flexibility in determining the method of instruction for teaching limited english proficient children i am genuinely pleased that the conference report lifts the 4percent funding cap on special alternative instruction programs to 25 percent this reform in the bilingual program is critical and recognizes that the research does not demonstrate that transitional bilingual education or nativelanguage instruction is more effective than special alternative instructionusually english as a second language or english immersionin teaching lep children under the current program only 4 percent of part a funding can be used for special alternative instruction programs the remaining 96 percent is earmarked for nativelanguage instruction programs h r 5 lifts the cap on alternative instruction to 25 percent lifting the cap on alternative instruction to 25 percent takes into account the concerns of many local school districts that this method of instruction best meets their needs for educating lep children when school districts must educate lep children from numerous language backgrounds alternative instruction provides very diverse students with the most efficient method of preparing them to read speak and write english the demand for alternative instruction clearly exists in 1985 the first year alternative instruction funding was available to school districts over 25 percent of the grant applicants requested this type of funding with the restrictions on alternative instruction loosened there may even be a greater demand for these grants to ensure that lep children move into allenglish classrooms as quickly as possible h r 5 limits student enrollment in federally funded bilingual programs to no longer than 3 years this restriction ensures that quality bilingual education programs will be implemented the success of magnet schools is affirmed under h r 5 research shows that magnet schools are successful at fostering educational excellence giving parents broader choices for their childrens education and achieving racial desegregation without forced busing more importantly the existence of magnet schools in a school district may challenge other schools to improve the quality of their programs resulting in benefits to the entire school system congressional and administration support for this program is rightfully growing the housepassed budget resolution increases the appropriation for magnet schools from 72 million this year to 110 million in 1989 i strongly support h r 5s 165 million authorization for this program in fiscal 1989 because magnet schools have been successful h r 5 establishes a new program of alternative curriculum schools which are very similar to magnet schools under this program grants will be made to schools specializing in certain academic areas that are not eligible for magnet school assistance as long as those school districts prove their commitment to integration and quality education eligible schools must be in districts that are at least 65 percent minority and the school itself must have at least 50 percent minority enrollment the conference report also includes initiatives to tackle illiteracy particularly among limited english proficient adults a new component of the adult education program authorizes funding for adults with limited english proficiency because adult education services are in great demand the basic grant program is not able to serve all of the eligible limited english proficient adults this new program specifically targets this population for adult education services improvements i sought in the drug free schools and communities act to help states and localities get drugs out of schools and off college campuses are incorporated in the conference report i authored a change requiring local applicants to describe the extent of the drug and alcohol problems in their schools the applicant must also describe its drug and alcohol policy including an explanation of the practices and procedures it will strictly enforce to eliminate the sale or use of drugs and alcohol on school premises to determine if schools are implementing effective programs and demonstrating success in combating drug use the conference report includes my amendment requiring the local applicant to submit progress reports to the state educational agency the reports must include information about the applicants significant accomplishments and the extent to which the original objectives of the plan were achieved if the state agency determines that the applicant is not making reasonable progress toward accomplishing its objectives it must provide technical assistance to the applicant the school improvement act embodies significant policy changes in our federal elementary and secondary education programs these improvements reflect the changing needs in educating our nations young people and preparing them for their future i strongly urge my colleagues to support this conference

representatives today represents several years of work by both the committee on agriculture and the committee c~n space science and technology a s mllar bill passed the senate on august 9 19811 which in fact was similar to the bill passed by the house of representatives in 1986 on a 305to85 vote the purpose of the bill before us today is to establish a 10year coordinated nutrition monitoring program in which public and private interc sts and priorities concerning this issue are analyzed and evaluated in a cooperative manner the bill establishes an interagency board for nutrition monitoring and related research comprised of representatives of federal agencies involved in nutrition monitoring a national nutrition monitoring advisory council comprised of persons providing scientific and technical assistance on nutrition monitoring and a grants program for development of uniform standards for monitoring dietary status and for state and local governments to develop the capacity to conduct nutrition monitoring i fully support nutrition monitoring activities in fact i was the author of an amendment to the 1985 farm bill that directs the secretary of agriculture to include in the usi a nationwide food consumption survey a sample that i representative of low income individuals in addition the usda will collect information on food purchases and other expenditures by low income individuals when conducting the departments continuing survey of individual food intake and any nationwide food consumption survey the usda must continue to maintain its nutrient data base and encourage research by public and private entities relating to effective standards methodologies and technologies for accurate assessment of nutritional and dietary status it is my hope that this bill will improve the system for nutrition monitoring and will provide more accurate and up to date information on the nutritional status of americans it must be noted that since 1977 the federal government has been moving toward creation of a national nutrition monitoring system and such a system has been considered during the past three congresses in addition the presidents task force on food assistance recommended that several steps be taken to improve information on the nutritional status of americans there are two national surveys that are the basis for data concerning the nutritional status of americans they are the national food consumption surveyconducted by the usdaand the health and nutrition examination surveyconducted by the department of health and human services these are national suveys of a sample of the population that is representative of the entire population both are very useful in that they identify the general wellbeing of the population and provide reference points by which other surveys of limited scope may be evalauted the bill before the house today requires continuation and coordination of these two studies and a plan designed to assess on a continuotis basis a representative sample of the low income population fo determine among other information food expenditures and participation in food assistance programs in addition the usda initiated a new type of survey in 1985 ent itiled the continuing survey of food intakes by individuals a nationally representative sample of women from 19 to 50 yeairs of age at all income levels and their hilrlren from ages i to 5 were surveyed for their dietary intake and eating habits for 12 months a similar survey was conducted for lowincome women and their children the first results of this survey were released in december 1985 and the most recent data was released in march 1988 this is an important survey because it provides timely information on the adequacy of the diets of a selected group of people and an early indication of dietary changes such information coupled with the work of both the usda and hiis will serve to improve our knowledge and programs aimed at bettering the lives of all amcricms no one should assume that the federal cavernment is not active in the area of nutrition monitoring within the usda alone there are eight agencieswith different areas of responsibilityoperating ongoing programs which promote and hnplement dietary guidelines for americans these include the extension service operates food and nutrition education programs in cooperation with the cooperative extension system to disseminate knowledge and applied research directly to the public in addition they operate the expanded food and nutrition education program for lowincome families and children the human nutrition information service coordinates dietary guidence policy develops researchbased dietary guidance materials for the public and reports results from its research in food composition food consumption and nutrition education to professionals the national agricultural library collects and disseminates information on a wide range of nutritional topics and accumulates and loans nutrition education materials to educators i know that the federal agencies involved in nutrition monitoring and nutrition education consider these subject to be a high priority i commend them for their attention to this goal nevertheless the bill before us today will serve to accentuate such activities and to provide the american public with a clear and comprehensive program aimed at assessing the nutritional status of the population we have included a specific title in the bill before us to ensure that the federal government speaks with one voice when it disseminates information on dietary guidance to americans title iii requires the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of health and human services to publish the docomentdietary guidelines for americansat least every 5 years the information contained in the guidelines is to be based on the nwdical and scientific evidence available title iii also contains the procedures to be followed for the issuance of all dietary guidelines by federal agencies this procedure will serve to ensure that such dietary guidelines are consistent with the publication dietary guidelines for americans and that federal agenices are not out in left field when advising americans of proper and healthful diets i commend the two departmentsusda and hhs for the improvements already made to the nutrition monitoring system and look forward to an even better system significant achievements have been made by the two departments over the past several years further improvements can be accomplished through passage of the

strong support of the conference report on h r 4174 the small business administration reauthorization and amendment act of 1988 this conference report authorizes programs and activities including salaries and expenses at the unitedstates small business administration for both fiscal years 1989 and 1990 it also provides budget authority for 1991 but without specifying program levels this measire reflects broad bipartisan support for the continuation of the unitedstates small business administration as an independent federal agency charged with the responsibility of assisting and promoting the creation development and growth of the nations small businesses this is fully consistent with the presidents own commitment to maintaining a strong vigorous small business sector and a federal agency that can assist small concerns there are more than 20 million small businesses nationwide that are contributing to the vitality strength and prosperity of the american economy they are providing needed goods and services generating tax revenues and creatng literally millions of new job opportunities i believe that the small business men and women of this country not only want but deserve to have a strong voice and a helping hand in washington they need to be heard on the issues that concern them and have a say in the formulation of policies and legislation that can affect their bottom line and they need to have an agency that will provide the k d of assistance that will help their firms grow and prosper we have seen to that in this bill during the hearing process we undertook a tough review of sba programs and activities this conference report which we present for your consideration represents our best efforts to address program weaknesses and to strengthen existing programs it is also an attempt to develop innovative forwardlooking initiatives that will assist americas small businesses in todays business environment while helping those concerns cope with the new competitive demands and challenges confronting them this conference report is a bipartisan approach to the task of providing the support and assistance our nations small business men and women need to sustain their commitment to making our economy second to none i would like to commend the chairman john lafalce distinguished members of the committee and their outstanding staffs for their diligence and hard work also i believe it is appropriate to commend our colleagues and their staffs in the other body for their hard work chairman lafalce has reviewed some ot the costs and program highlights i would like to emphasize that the bill has used the 1988 authorization level as a baseline adjusted for inflation to set program and activity levels in the out years modest increases have been made in some programs to accommodate increased actual and anticipated demand the small business administration is the chief federal agency charged with the responsibility of helping the nations small businesses i believe it is important to review the broad scope of services and assistance the agency provides to small concerns the agency guarantees loans made by banks and other institutions to eligible small businesses it offers direct loans to specific target groups including businesses located in areas suffering from high unemployment or owned by vietnamera or disabled veterans handicapped individuals and organizations employing the handicapped we have authorizod funds to maintain loan levels so that those men and women with promising ideas can start small businesses and current owners can expand their enterprises when disaster strikes at home the sba is there to make loans to help community businesses recover and rebuild we have authorized funds to ensure that loans will continue to be available in times of disaster the drought that has swept this nation has laid waste to several crops the repercussions caused by the drought are now being actuely felt by small firms whose business depends on farmers i know from my own district that the drought has ravaged many crops causing suffering and economic injury to both farmers and their suppliers the conferees have agreed that victims of droughtsincluding agricultural cooperativeswho cannot obtain credit elsewhere should be eligible for disaster loan assistance this should help many of our small business owners in local droughtstricken communities get back on their feet small contractors in need of surety bonds can utilize the sba surety bond guarantee program the conferees have agreed to increase the guarantee for surety bonds under 100 000 and we have authorized a 3year pilot program for preferred surety bonds we have continued support for the small business development

current small business owners i1197 02 the conferees have directed the small business administration to identify those federal agencies that have substantial procure ment or grant making authority which could be used to promote rural small businesses i believe that small businesses in rural america have much to contribute to this nation through their increased participation in the economy it is vitally important that the federal government recognize as the conferees have that rural small businesses have a role to play in creating jobs and furnishing needed products and services sba assists minority entrepreneurs by providing management and technical assistance and administering a special procurement program for them we have authorized several of these programs in this conference report while we have brought farreaching reform to the entire program in another bill one of the major obstacles to more effectivoly assisting the nations small businesses is the lack of data on existing small concerns therefore i have asked the small business administration to study and report to congress on the feasibility of and need for developing an expanded national directory of small businesses which would include each companys capability standard industrial code federal supply number and other relevant data this study will provide valuable clues and recommendations for improving data collection on the nations small concerns the agency ensures that small businesses receive a fair proportion of federal government contracts for the purchase of needed goods and services we have authorized the agencys procurement program that is helping small concerns become suppliers of needed foods and services to the federal government through access to federal contract opportunities firms requiring specialized technical and management assistance can obtain it through the agency we have made sure that these small concerns will continue to have access to the assistance and services they need to grow their businesses we haver authorized 3 5 million for the sbas office of international trade to help small firms meet the challenges of global competition and embrace the opportunities to

conference report represents the culmination of our efforts which began with hearings last february to address the needs of the aviation system during the remainder of this decade and beyond i dont have to remind my colleagues of the problems we have seen this yearlate flights missed connections lostluggage and a rising tide of complaints about airline service from our constituents although there were many reasons for these problems the root cause was the failure of our nations airport and airway system to keep pace with the increase in demand from passengers and general aviation this conference report begins to address these problems it addresses the problem by authorizing substantially more money for airport improvements and air traffic control modernization this money can be used to build runways to purchase sophisticated computers and navigation aids and to take other steps that will enhance capacity and safety this increase in funding will not require any increase in taxes because the money will come out of the aviation trust fund which is entirely supported by user fees and already has a surplus of more than 5 billion there are several specific provisions in this conference report that i would like to briefly mention the legislation provides about 30 million per year over the next 3 years for additional instrument landing systems since the new microwave landing system is facing mounting delays it is important that we move to intall more rlss now the legislation directs that 75 percent of these ilss go to primary and reliever airports and 25 percent go to smaller general aviation airports the airport at rogers ar is one general aviation airport that we would expect to benefit from this 25 percent setaside the conference report also contains a senate provision requiring the faa to continue their contract tower program we have modified that provision however to direct the faa to extend the program to other towers springdale ar which has purchased an air traffic control tower on its own would be a good candidate for the expanded contract tower program in addition the conference rebort retains the concept of the national plan of integrated airport systems npias first articulated by the former ranking member of this committee mr don clausen this requires the faa to take a national systems approach to planning for airport it111697 development and capacity enhancement it will require a major cooperative effort involving both the faa and the airport sponsors it is in the national interest to develop in metropolitan areas an integrated system of airports designed to provide expeditious access and maximum safety for all airspace users this policy directive by the congress takes on added significance as the senatehouse conferees emphasize the requirement for a systems plan for our nations air transportation system therefore the conference continues the requirement for a national plan of integrated airport systems for meeting the needs of our national air transportation system the plan shall include the type and estimated cost of eligible airport development necessary to provide a safe efficient and integrated system of public use airports to meet the needs of civil aeronautics the national defense and the postal service in reviewing and revising the npias the secretary shall consider the needs of and consult with all segments of civil aviation and where appropriate military aviation the planning preserving and enhancing of airport system capacity safety and security must continue to be a priority objective of faa and all state and local airport sponsors in defining the airport systems planning process the secretary shall consider the needs of and consult with all airspace users the aviation industry and community interests in determining the longterm airport system capacity requirements through the year 2010 the faa should issue guidelines to states and local airport sponsors that will result in a master plan of airport sites within the framework of a statewide airport systems plan that can be coordinated with faas national plan of integrated airport systems the concept of integrated airport systems has special applications to the metropolitan and regional areas of the country the basic objectives of the integrated airport system is to develop a master plan of airport site selection based on the airspace capacity of a given metropolitan or regional area it should be designed to enhance air traffic flow management and meet the needs of all segments of aviation the same concept can be applied to rural areas throughout the united states where a number of communities in need of air transportation and airport services could coordinate their mutual aviation interests establish a regional airport authority or adopt a joint exercise of powers agreement planning document embracing the integrated airport system concept the master plan of airport sites once selected should then be agreed to and adopted by formal resolution of each political subdivision of the local council of governments and designed to optimize the service to all communities of a metropolitan or regional area in establishing priorities for distribution of funds the secretary may give priority to projects that are consistent with integrated airport system plans in addressing airport capacity enhancement the faa should increase its usage of airport simulator models and apply the information to first airport site specific capacity enhancement and second airport system capacity enhancement the national plan of integrated airport systems should maintain and improve the performance of individual airports as well as the entire airport system rather than being only a listing of specific airport projects the national plan of integrated airport systems should define and outline the nations overall airport systems needs for the future the cornerstone of the integrated airport systems concept is its emphasis on airport system planning and capacity enhancement and in particular the development of new airports the development and improvement of satellite reliever and general aviation airports heliports and hub airports serving allcargo air carriers the satellite reliever and general aviation airports in an integrated airport system will not only relieve congestion in our major metropolitan areas by attracting air traffic away from the busier air carrier facilities but also provide safe and assured access to those areas for commuters business and general aviation expedited implementation of a viable satellite reliever system is critically needed to increase the safety and enhance the capacity of our nations airport systems the conference report also includes a disadvantaged business enterprise provision or dbe provision as it is commonly called for airport improvement projects this provision is virtually identical to the dbe provision in the surface transportation act that the house overwhelmingly approved back in march the provision requires that at least 10 percent of the airport improvement program funds be expended with firms owned by women and the traditional ethnic minority groups defined by the small business act this is a modification of the present airport improvement program currently there is no statutory national goal for minority and women business participation in faa funded projects but the program is administered with two separate goals one for minorityowned firms and one for womenowned firms the conference agreement before us today will consolidate the existing twogoal system into a onegoal system for dbes airport improvement projects utilizing federal funds would have only one goal for dbes giving contractors bidding on these projects the flexibility to make best efforts to meet dbe goals by utilizing qualified minorityowned businesses womenowned businesses or a combination of both since passage of the surface transportation act in april dot has implemented the same dbe provision with respect to highway and mass transit projects that provision continued the 10 percent requirement already in law and consolidated an existing twogoal system into a onegoal system by including women within the definition of dbe in reports from dot and the states i understand that the consolidation of the program into a onegoal system is working quite well since the highway mass transit and airport improvement programs constitute virtually all the federalaid construction programs of the department of transportation it is important that there be consistency in the implementation of the dbe provisions applying to these programs in view of the successful implementation of the dbe provision in the highway and mass transit programs and to assure consistency and uniformity in the implementation of the virtually identical dbe statutory provisions the same dbe regulations that apply to federally assisted highway and mass transit projects should also apply to federally assisted airport improvement projects i would like to draw my colleagues attention to the essential air service eeas program which is part of this legislation last october the eas amendment that i offered to h r 2310 was overwhelmingly adopted by this body the provision included in this conference report is almost identical to the version we originally adopted it ensures the continuation of air service to many small communities throughout the nation it offers them the opportunity to improve their air service and to increase passenger usage it will also give additional communities a chance to benefit from the program with only a modest increase in cost finally the eas section addresses the problem of codesharing the use of a major airlines 2letter identification code by a smaller airline major airlines will be required to take some responsibility for the service provided by their smaller codesharing partners this applies to all codesharing relationships not just to those where one carrier is providing essential air service i would like to thank mr howard"],

similar legislation in the senate we face the best prospects for enactment of new rail safety legislation in several years our rail system is one of the worlds safest means of travel for example in 1985 our rail system provided some 12 billion revenue passengermiles of service with only 3 passenger fatalities but when there is even a single lapse in the system as there was last january 4 at

passengers for railroad employees and for all who come into contact with the railroad industry this bill will eliminate the single most serious gap in our rail safety lawsthe lack of any direct legal authority by the department of transportation over railroad personnel by curing this deficiency and by modernizing the scale of fines that may be imposed for safety violations we will be giving our transportation officials the tools they need to deter detect and where necessary punish safety violations as under present law there must be wide discretion for federal officials but this bill will make sure that the available sanctions can actually reach those responsible for reckless or unsafe conduct even after last years amtrak crash for example where safety warning devices had been rendered inoperative there have been over 50 confirmed instances of such tampering todays bill will make such conduct a specific violation of the federal railroad safety act it will also give the department of transportation the power to remove proven safety violators from safetysensitive positions on the railroads besides addressing the human factor in accidents the railroad safety improvement act also makes use of technical means to prevent accidents automatic train control is mandated for all trains operating on the northeast corridor by mid1990 looking farther ahead the department of transportation is required to evaluate more advanced traincontrol and collisionavoidance systems for other routes where passengers or hazardous materials are transported while railroad transportation is very safe for passengers the fate of people traversing grade crossings is a different matter in 1985 for example over 55 percent of all railroad fatalities resulted from gradecrossing collisions

families the same is true in the area of care for older people we know that on any given day that there are older people who are in desperate need of home health care if we could get care to them in their homes we know again as sure as the night follows the day because those in the gerontology field the experts tell us that it is this way that if we can get the care to those in the home we can prevent our citizens from being institutionalized this administration has ratcheted down in every way possible on home care benefits they have tried through every possible administrative route to ratchet down on the very care for older people home health care that older people need most and is most likely to produce longterm savings 0 so my colleague has said it very well when he talks about really the priorities and the cost effectiveness of trying to address peoples needs be they kids or seniors with responsible programs that help our citizens and save money down the road i just want to

some of our history that otherwise would very likely be lost this type of vehicle this commission will help to preserve not just the physical features of it but i think to plant in our mind the important role that was played by those entrepeneurs by the working men and women by those involved in our economy by labor labor unions and the others that became so much a part of what the gentleman called as he referred to that area an arsenal of democracy but i think it is really something that lifted our nation from being one of many nations to the foremost nation in terms of western

decision that was made to restrict funding came within the department of defense and it came because their internal mechanisms the comptroller and the people who watch their accounts indicated to them that they were about to exceed the outlays that had been agreed to and the budget i think it is principally outlays not so much budget authority within the figures that were agreed to in the summit as a result of that they felt that they were that is to say that the department was in a situation where they had to pull a brake on outlays until at least the end of june in order to try to recoup expenditures and get back into a level where they would be within the summit they have done that we have not fettered them in terms of that discretion in fact may i say to my distinguishedcolleague the gentleman from texas that we have tried to give them some more flexibility to manage the problem within their own accounts by boosting what they call their transferability within various accounts

the soviet unions new policy of glasnost or openness regarding its dealings with both its citizens and other nations of the world however upon closer inspection one will find that this new policy consists more of empty rhetoric than actual deeds true there have been some families who have been allowed to emigrate from the soviet union to the free world and for that we are grateful but the happy ending for these families are but small victories victories that are overshadowed by the thousands and thousands of individuals whose happy endings have yet to be written and whose dreams remain unfulfilled during the first two months of 1987 and following the implementationof the new emigration law on january 1 only 244 soviet jews were allowed to leave this is not a significant improvement over the number of soviet jews who were allowed to leave during 1985 and 1986 in fact almost 400 000 jews continue to be denied the right to be with their loved ones and practice their religious beliefs since my election to congress in 1983 i have tried to secure the release of several families who sought to emigrate from the soviet union one of those families boris and irene ghinis was finally allowed to emigrate last year and arrived in the united states several months ago after more than 8 years of struggle i recently received a letter from the ghinis in which they wrote at this moment of our happiness we cannot forget about many of our friends who have been struggling for many years for free emigration from the soviet union the have asked me to help secure the release of three families in particular alexander and irina berdichevski who have been trying to emigrate since 1982 the yusephoviches who have been refuseniks since 1980 and the shustoroviches who have sought the right to emigrate since 1977 i have taken up the cause of these three families and have added them to the group of families i continue to fight for the mikhail kazanovich family the antanas vausa family and the family of nachman komack as we continue to fight for the rights of soviet jews and people around the world who live under oppressive states it is imperative that we impress upon soviet leaders that we have not been duped by their claims of glasnost and that countries with true policies of openness place a higher regard on the rights of the individual not the iron will of the government steady and constant pressure can move a seemingly immovable object let us take courage from the infinite strength and unflagging faith of those who seek freedom and redouble our efforts on

programs only funded by this money redistributed from sdi these moneys were merely being added to already existing programs second the gentleman from washington had earlier indicated that same argument and i point out to him this money is simply being redistributed back to sdi the gentleman from florida has made a point about funding the need to fund other programs as well conventional programs and others and i think that is certainly a valid point that is why i proposed a couple of days ago to steadily and slowly increase defense spending we need increases across the board we do not need to take it at the cost of sdi let me reiterate the numbers out of a 300billion defense budget we are here talking either about the carlucci proposal which is my amendment at 1 percent of the entire defense budget or the committee proposal which is 1 4 percent of the entire defense budget i think it is a ludicrous argument to contend that the sdi program is stealing money from other programs and is breaking the back of these other programs the fact of the matter is that like the gentleman from california has indicated before he would just as soon there would be no sdi program and has called for an honest debate about whether we ought to have any spending for it rather than simply letting it starve by amounts of funding that permit it to starve but do not actually cut it off i

through july 2 1988 i would like to take this opportunity to say a few words on behalf of common sense oo last years national safety belt use day i spoke about how wearing a seatbelt allowed a suffolk county police officer named robin kane to walk away from a devastating car wreck no doubt many of the members in this room can tell similar tales of how a safety belt spared the life of someone they know still many people do not bother to take a second or two to fasten their seathelts before driving off in a recent survey of automobile travelers in my home state of new york the first state to enact a mandatory safety belt use law 46 percent of the car users did not apparently drivers and passengers do not realize the dangers which they face when falling to invest a few moments of their time into a commonsense procedure which could safeguard them from injury and death approximately every 10 minutes someone dies in a traffic accident every day roughly 140 people die in cars that is the equivalent of a major airplane crash once every 24 hours on our roads over a years time motor vehicle accidents in the united states kill more than 40 000 people they also account for neariy 3 million individual injuries more than 4 million hospital days and over 15 million lost days of work each year according to the national highway traffic safety administration 91 percent of the occupants killed in auto accidents in 1985 were not wearing their safety belts the national safety council estimates that 12 000 to 15 000 lives could be saved annually if all passenger car occupants used safety belts at all times in 1987 buckling up reportedly saved 2 435 lives and prevented 28 900 injuries this is significant because in automobile accidents the most severe injuries are generally caused by the second collision in which the abrupt change in momentum accompanying the sudden stop caused by the accident causes the occupants to be thrown against the interior of the automobile automobile passengers can be protected from this second collision by seatbelts the importance of wearing safety belts cannot be overemphasized that is why i am pleased to be able to rise to speak in support of national safety belt use week"], [7.748603820800781e-07, 0.4999992251396179, 0, "and all other members of the conference committee on h r 2 for their expeditious completion of the

projects the conference committees action should save thousands of construction jobs this spring across the nation i am sure that some of the members are aware that as late as yesterday morning there was considerable concern that final approval by the conferees of this document was being delayed because of what some have called the mudflap flap basically that term pertains to the disagreement between the house and senate over the issuance of regulations for splash and spray suppression devices commonly referred to as mudflaps i am happy to report that the mudflap flap is over and that the house and senate have agreed to a compromise on this important matter under the compromise the secretary must issue a final rule requiring the use of splash and spray suppression devices unless she finds that thereis no available technology that will significantly improve driver visibility and significantly reduce splash and spray furthermore the devices must be tested under both real world conditions and in the laboratory this agreement should also improve highway safety while this may seem to be a very small issue to some it is a lifeordeath issue to small manufacturers of mudflaps nationwide including a number in my congressional district in ohio the language would permit these small manufacturers to compete on a more level playing field with industry giants to develop and

other congressmen maybe there is too much collegiality here in the house maybe it is time that we looked at what some of the other esteemed professions who get rated very high in public opinion polls do such as doctors engineers and cpas they have real peer review as a matter of fact there are some professions that are not required to have public oversight boards who have private corporations and private partnerships but nevertheless impose on themselves that very high standard so that the public can feel that there is credibility in what they do so i think there is ample cause to be looking

reasons that i vill go into later but people have argued that we must have the independent counsel cover members of congress because the house ethics committee has not been doing its job that is a very fundamental misreading of the role of the house ethics committee the house ethics committee is not charged with criminal prosecution members who believe that we must have an independent counsel covering members of the house apparently believe that edwin meese and the justice department are failing to do their jobs now we have an independent counsel with regard to members of the ad ministration we have had that since a democratic congress passed that to apply to a democratic president because of the belief that there is an inherent conflict of interest when an attorney general has to investigate his own colleagues i think that is an institutional conflict of interest its existence does not mean that anybody is delinquent but now we are being told by some members that we must have an independent counsel because there are cases involving potential corruption in the congress that are not being covered i want to say i think that is a little unfair to ed meese now understand that the house ethics committee is not the prosecutor here the justice department is so people who have told us that we must have an independent counsel to cover congress remember the conflict of interest which is inherent which is the basis of the independent counsel in the executive branch is not present between the executive branch and members of congress so what we are apparently being told is that mr meese is either incompetent or unwilling to prosecute congressional corruption because the house ethics committee does not have the function of prosecution if members
