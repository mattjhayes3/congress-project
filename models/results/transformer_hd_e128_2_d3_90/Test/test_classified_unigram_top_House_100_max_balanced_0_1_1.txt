20 years since their initial funding by the congress of the united states there are two such programs in the seventh congressional district and 18 programs in the state of north carolina providing care through 34 practice sites in medically underserved areas of our state nationally this network of nearly 800 primary health care centers has meant that for the first time citizens living in low income or medically underserved areas have been able to go to the doctor to seek medical attention when it is needed and to receive that care in a dignified and efficient manner a large and rapidly increasing number of americans have no health insurance this figure includes many who are among the working poor these people cannot purchase the medical care they need on an outofpocket basis the community and migrant health centers provide a place where these individuals and families can receive the care they need at a cost they can afford while medicaid has been an important aid in supporting the costs of medical care its benefits have not been extended to all those families with incomes below the federal poverty level only one in four people served by community and migrant health centers are covered by medicaid the others although they are poor and without health insurance must depend on the health centers as their safety net in addition to dramatically improving access to care the community and migrant health centers have consistently provided care which is comprehensive beth in concept and in the actual delivery of services there has been a strong commitment to preventive care that is the most economical kind of care early ch dhood health screenings infant and child immunization programs community health education programs high blood pressure screenings are all essential ingredients of the health centers total services these preventive services are integrated with the acute and episodic care that families require when confronted with illness or injury these services are further enriched by the provision of ongoing management of chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetesconditions which affect very large numbers of the adult and elderly populations responding to the mandate to provide comprehensive care the health centers often include onsite pharmacies or agreements with community pharmacists to ensure that the medicines needed to treat or control these chronic conditions are available in seeking to establish comprenensive networks of care the community and migrant iealth centers have demonstrated great skills and determination in linking their services to those already provided in the community by other agencies sharing of space coordinated referral networks formal interagency agreements all result in improved access and more comprehensive care and not incidentally reduce the total cost of care by all agencies involved comprehensive care also means a program of health care services that is responsive to the expressed needs of the community the migrant and community health centers differ from other health care providers in this important respectthey are anchored in the community governed by boards of local residents responsive to the schedules of the local population they offer night and weekend clinic hours for working families and as a result are especially well supported by the communities they serve studies have established that among the users of those health centers from 67 to 89 percent consider the health center as their primary source of medical care but far more important than improved access to care and the comprehensiveness of care the impressive record of cost containment underscores the success of this important federal program in an environment of rapidly increasing health care costs and growing pressure on the federal budget and on state budgets our support for community and migrant health centers has resulted in a net savings to the federal budget how has this been accomplished first the health centers have been extremely efficient providers of care between 1974 and 1983 the health centers increased the population they served by more than 300 percent even though their grant funding levels grew by only 65 percent some of this remarkable growth has been the result of increased productivity in that same timeframe productivity rose by 43 percent and administrative costs already low by comparison with other federally funded programs fell by the same percentageminus 43 percent the increased productivity also meant that the cost per patient visit fell by 21 percentand by 60 percent when inflation is taken into accountduring the same period health centers encourage more appropriate use of health services the emphasis in preventive services and on the continuing management of chronic conditions means patients tend to have fewer episodes of acute illness nonhealthcenter patients use emergency room services nearly 60 percent more frequently than health center patients the case for our support of these important programs has never been stronger than it is today not only because they save us money through reduced medicaid expenditures and through efficient delivery of clinical services but because they reach out to underserved populations do they deserve our support it has been well documented that minority citizens suffer serious health disadvantages they are less healthy and they have much less access to health care services it is these populations that are the special focus of the community and migrant health centers nearly 70 percent of their total users are members of minority groupsgroups where the greatest gains can be made by providing health care which is accessible and cost effective over 60 percent of the users of the health centers have family incomes that fall below the federal poverty level without access to the health centers these families would face serious financial barriers to needed health care services it is a deeply disturbing reality that children represent the largest segment of our population living in poverty but among the users of migrant and community health centers over onethird of the patients are children the health centers are responding to the special needs of this population with early childhood screening immunization programs parenting instructions and access to acute care in a time of widespread need and a time of severe fiscal constraint support for community and migrant health centers makes great sense these programs are extremely effective providers of health care for low income and medically underserved citizens they have earned the support of the local communities they serve and have provided net savings to the federal health care budget simply put we cannot afford not to invest in these important programs"], [0.4912042021751404, 0.5087957978248596, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume h r 2182 makes both technical amendments and minor

desirable that outcome as a matter of policy the massey decision is wrong as a matter of rule interpretation the massey courts conclusion that a licensed psychologist is as capable as a psychiatrist

rules enabling acts set forth the procedure for amending various rules of procedure used by federal courts and the federal rules of evidence in brief the rulemaking procedure begins with an advisory committee of the judicial conference of the united states preparing an initial draft of a proposed new rule or amendment to an existing rule which it submits to the judicial conferences standing committee on rules of practice and procedure the judicial conference reviews any proposal recommended by the standing committee and submits that proposal together with the conferences recommendation to the supreme court the supreme court acts upon the judicial conferences recommendation and must before may 1 of any year promulgate any new rule or amendment to an existing rule of which it approves a new rule or amendment promulgated by the supreme court does not take effect until 90 days after promulgation 180 days after promulgation in the case of the federal rules of evidence in order to give congress an opportunity to review the new rule or amendment before it takes effect the rules enabling acts process worked well for many years with the federal rules becoming a model for the states new rules and amendments to existing rules routinely took effect without any congressional intervention in recent years however congress has taken a greater interest in new rules and amendments promulgated under the rules enabling acts congress intervened in 1973 to delay indefinitely the effective date of the proposed federal rules of evidence and subsequently enacted a congressional lydrafted rules of evidence along with an enabling act for the rules of evidence since then congress frequently has intervened either to delay the effective date of disapprove or modify rules and

the judicial conference and its committees before being forwarded to the supreme court last congress the subcommittee on courts civil liberties andthe administration of justice under the able

procedure for example provides that all laws in conflict with any such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect originating in the rules enabling act of 1934

promptly when the judicial conference has criticized practice or procedure statutes that interfere with the efficient and just administration of the judicial system for example over many congresses a series of civil priorities were engrafted into the united states code judicial conference criticisms off those provisions led congress to repeal them pub l no 98620 401 98 stat 335657 1984 see h rep

drug trafficking was a more serious threat to the national security of our nation than communism i would certainly agree with the chief justices assessment i have yet to pick up a newpaper in the morning and read about any neighborhoods in our cities that have been taken over by communists but on almost any day of the week you can read about the devastation and the toll of human lives that drug abuse and drug trafficking are exacting from our communities unfortunately there is little hope that the situation will improve in the near future the production of illicit narcotics abroad has been increasing steadily and we can expect bumper crops again this year according to the state departments international narcotics control strategy report for 1987 worldwide production of opium coca and marijuana is up the annual report of the united nations international narcotics control board for 1986 underscores the worldwide expansion of drug abuse and drug trafficking the report states that illicit production and manufacture of drugs takes place in a growing number of countries located in many regions worldwide in some areas the report notes drug trafficking is closely connected with arms trafficking and is associated with subversion and international terrorism drug trafficking generates vast sums which are laundered to conceal their illicit origins the entire process the report states imperils the very political stability and security of some countries earlier this year i was honored to represent the speaker at a meeting of andean parliamentarians in colombia south america it was disheartening to see how powerful drug traffickers in colombia have waged a war of fear and intimidation against the government the press and almost anyone who dares to oppose them effectively paralyzing drug enforcement efforts the select committee on narcotics abuse and control which i chair estimates that approximately 178 tons of cocaine 12 tons of heroin and 30 000 to 60 000 tons of marijuana were smuggled into the united states last year our borders are like a sieve against the flood of narcotics entering our country despite their best efforts federal drug enforcement agencies intercept only an estimated 10 to 15 percent of the flow of illegal drugs destined for our shores federal law enforcement officials have testified before the select committee that they cannot do a significantly better job of reducing the availability of drugs in the united states even if their resources are doubled as long as foreign production and domestic demand continues to grow as a result of the federal governments inability to halt expanding drug production and trafficking illegal drugs have never been more readily available on the streets of our cities and communities drugs are also cheaper and purer than ever before many drug law enforcement officials have become frustrated about the ability of their profession to cope with the drug problem they say that drug enforcement is at best a holding action and plead for a massive educational effort to attack drug abuse unfortunately efforts to reduce the demand for drugs through treatment and prevention lag far behind the growing abuse of drugs the facts and figures of the drug epidemic are all too familiar but the simple fact is that we face a drug abuse epidemic in this country today that experts tell us is unparalleled in any other industrialized nation in the world drug abuse has become a national tragedy in term of lives lost and ruined families torn apart communities destroyed in the face of this growing tragedy existing treatment programs have been unable to keep up with the expanding number of people who need help long waiting lists for treatment are common in many cities despite the clamor for extensive drug education efforts led by administration officials from the president on down state and local school agencies have not had the resources to mount such efforts and until last year the federal department of education spent only 3 million a year for drug abuse education out of a budget of nearly 18 billion against the backdrop of a drug problem growing more severe and out of control the congress acted boldly last year to enact sweeping legislation that for the first time provides a comprehensive federal program to attack drug trafficking and abuse the antidrug abuse act of 1986 public law 99570 and the continuing resolution that funded it provided nearly 1 7 billion in new federal funds to attack all aspects of our nations drug abuse problem this legislation significantly enhanced federal resources for drug enforcement and interdiction international narcotics control drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation and drug abuse education and prevention enactment of the antidrug abuse act of 1986 with overwhelming bipartisan support and cooperation in the congress was a truly historic achievement the antidrug abuse act makes a good start toward bringing drug abuse and drug trafficking under control it is only a first step however much more remains to be done congress and the administration have not always agreed on the priority to give to drug programs in terms of federal spending in the antidrug abuse act some changes were negotiated to accommodate a number of a number of the administrations concerns about drug funding the administration however did not play an active role in the shaping of this legislation i have no doubt that congress could have written a better bill if the administration has been willing to work with us to allocate the resources we provided in the most effective way possible nonetheless when the president signed the act into law at an impressive white house ceremony last october 27 he embraced it fully saying it reflected the total commitment of the american peoplkeand their government to fight the evil of drugs the president also said the american people want their government to get tough and go on the offensive and thats exactly what we intend with more ferocity than ever before standing behind the president that day as he signed the bill and handed the pen to the first lady i hoped he was signaling a new willingness on the part of his administration to work cooperatively with congress in funding a vigorous and effective antidrug program however when the presidents 1988 budget proposals arrived on capitol hill just over 2 months later many of my congressional colleagues and i were shocked and dismayed to find that the total commitment and ferocity the president had spoken of seemed to have been forgotten the presidents budget proposed to cut funding in a number of critical programs included by congress in the antidrug bill the state and local narcotics control assistance program which provides 225 million to state and local governments for enhanced drug enforcement activites was eliminated entirely in 1988 congress has authorized this program through 1989 funds for drug abuse education programs were slashed in half from 200 million in 1987 to 100 million in 1988 the 1988 request is 150 million below the amount authorized by congress in the antidrug abuse act this program too is authorized through 1989 and the house voted earlier this year in h r 5 the school improvement act of 1987 to extend the program through 1993 no additional funds were requested for drug abuse treatment in 1988 instead funds provided to carry out the expanded treatment initiatives authorized in the antidrug abuse act would be spread over 2 years to support programs in both 1987 and 1988 the alcohol drug abuse and mental health block grant was frozen at the 1987 level of 495 million a total of 1998 positions were eliminated from the customs service in 1987 and 1988 more than wiping out the gains congress intended for the customs service in the drug law the 1988 request of 86 million for the customs air program was half of the 1987 funding level of 171 million at 98 8 million the 1988 proposed funding level for international narcotics control efforts by the state departments bureau of international narcotics matters was nearly 20 million below the 1987 funding provided by congress the 1988 request for federal drug enforcement spending was also lower than the 1987 level because approximately 350 million appropriated for capital purchases in 1987 is not repeated in the 1988 budget now i understand that if you buy a ship or a plane in one year you dont have to buy it again the next year but do the president and his budget advisers really believe the additional equipment congress authorized last year is enough to deter let alone stop the tons and tons of illegal drugs flooding across our borders each year have they no plan to share with us to enhance our border defenses against drugs the presidents budget did propose about 70 million in increases for federal drug law enforcement and i support those proposals but they pale in comparison to the overall cuts all in all the presidents 1988 budget would have reduced federal spending for drug abuse prevention and control by about 950 million from the 1987 level of 4 billion overall i fail to see how cuts of this magnitude reflect a strong commitment to an effective national drug abuse strategy congress felt strongly that the programs established in the antidrug abuse act are necessary to assist state and local governments in effectively combatting drug abuse and drug traffic the reagan administration has been urging the american people to just say no to drugs but their budget sounds more like just say no to drug funding a major concern that has emerged from hearings the select committee has held this year is that the presidents proposed budget would have a chilling effect on the new drug abuse programs made possible by the antidrug abuse act witness after witness has told our committee that it makes little sense for state and local governments to embark upon new and innovative drug control and prevention efforts if federal support for those efforts is to be terminated or subtantially reduced after a year the administration apparently believes that the problems many of our communities are having because of drugs are local problems not national problems in testimony before the select committee in march of this year omb director james c miller iii defended the administrations plan to terminate funding for state and local drug law enforcement grants saying it is our view that programs which primarily benefit a local community should in most cases be paid for by that community to that argument i say let the president attorney general meese and their budget advisers visit the crowded courtrooms of new york the packed jails of los angeles county and the outgunned police of miami and tell them that drug enforcement is not a national problem and that the drug enforcement assistance congress authorized for 1987 is not needed in 1988 let the president secretary bowen and their budget advisers inspect the drug abuse treatment centers in newark boston or in any other part of the country and tell those people who are on waiting lists desperately seeking help for their addictions that congress was wrong in coming to their aid let them tell the innocent men women and children who have or will develop aids from an infected ivdrug using parent or loved one that drug abuse is a local problem let the president secretary bennett and their budget advisers go into any classroom in america and tell our kids that congress was wrong in trying to provide them with the best drug abuse education possible the democratic budget embodied in the recently passed congressional budget resolution for 1988 rejects the administrations deep cuts in federal drug programs and generally assumes full funding of the new initiatives enacted in the antidrug abuse act of 1986 funding for drug abuse agencies and programs cuts across a number of budget functions including health drug abuse treatment prevention and research education drug abuse education administration of justice e g justice dea state and local drug law enforcement grants customs transportation coast guard and international affairs international narcotics control the budget resolution generally provides spending targets for these functions that are nearly identical to or higher than the housepassed versions of the budget resolution the major exception is in the area of international affairs which provides 150 million less in budget authority and 100 million less in outlays than the house bill in addition the spending ceilings included in the budget resolutions for the health education and administration of justice functions are all well above the cbo current policy baseline which is the level needed to keep pace with inflation and continue current policy the transportation function although 500 million below current policy is still 850 million above the house mark international affairs spending is 1 3 billion less than current policy for budget authority and 650 million less for outlays the spending targets in the congressional budget resolution provide ample flexibility to sustain the antidrug initiatives begun last year as the primary sponsor of the state and local narcotics control assistance program incorporated in last years omnibus drug bill i am especially pleased with the spending targets for administration of justice in the budget resolution the resolution is 400 million above the house target and 250 million over current services this level is more than adequate to permit all discretionary programs in 1988 to be funded at 1987 levels with increases for key priorities such as drug enforcement i am pleased this budget blueprint recognizes the need to give drug abuse prevention and control a top national priority and i urge my colleagues in the house and senate to give these efforts the high priority they deserve in the consideration of appropriations

today than at any time since the great depression despite the last 4 years of economic recovery the homeless population has been growing at the rate of about 25 percent a year and the number of homeless is expected to increase still further unless action is taken the explosion in the number of homeless americans has outrun the ability of local governments and charitable organizations to cope with the problem cities across the country report that homeless peopleincluding families with childrenare routinely being turned away from emergency shelters due to the lack of space efforts to deal with the homeless crisis have been hampered by persistent myths about who the homeless are why they are in such a desperate situation and what can be done to help them there are six myths which perpetuate a distorted picture of the homeless these myths are first most of the homeless have always lived this way second the homeless are almost entirely made up of single adults third the vast majority of the homeless are the chronically mentally ill who generally choose to be homeless fourth state and local governments and charitable organizations have the resources to handle the homeless problem fifth economic growth will solve the problem and sixth the federal government cannot afford to deal with the homeless the facts are first most of the homeless have become homeless only in recent years second families with children are the fastest growing group among the homeless now comprising almost onethird of the homeless population third the mentally ill which make up only 29 percent of the total number of homeless are not a majority of the homeless and while some do refuse assistance most mentally ill homeless have not chosen to live that way fourth existing shelter programs are already filled beyond capacity despite the best efforts of charitable organizations and local governments to create more shelters fifth there is no correlation between an expanding economy and solving the homeless problem in fact the fastest growth in homelessness has occurred during the current economic recovery and sixth modest andtargeted federal funding can greatly improve the lives of the homeless without straining the budget in response to the alarming increase in homelessness in the last few years homeless relief legislation has been a high priority of this congress on january 21 the democratic steering and policy committee adopted a resolution urging prompt enactment of legislation and appropriations to care for the homeless the legislation before us today is the first important step in realizing this goal h r 558 authorizes 500 million in new budget authority in fiscal year 1987 for a variety of homeless aid programs the funds autnorized are largely for existing local programs that will be unable to meet the needs of the homeless during fiscal year 1987 without additional assistance notably all funds appropriated under this bills authorizations would remain available until expended h r 558 authorizes for fiscal year 1987 funding for the following an existing emergency food and shelter program an ongoing program for rehabilitating buildings into temporary shelters support services for the homeless at group homes rental certificates for lowcost rental housing new permanent housing for the handicapped homeless conversion of underutilized government property into facilities for assisting homeless families and individuals and outpatient health care and mental health services for the homeless in addition food assistance for the homeless reported out of the agriculture committee have been incorporated into the bill by the rules committee these provisions would not increase spending for fiscal year 1987 but would authorize increased spending of 225 million in fiscal year 1988 through fiscal year 1990 for food assistance to the needy these provisions amend the food stamp program to better target benefits to the homeless and to prevent homelessness expand the surplus cheese program and reauthorize the temporary emergency food assistance program through fiscal year 1990 as a representative from southern west virginia i am very much concerned with the plight of the homeless the residents of my congrssional district have been burdened with failing industries and the ensuing high unemployment rates for the past decade while the figures on what monetary relief this bill will provide to west virginia are either nonexistent or very rough in nature i have gleaned some hope for my states future ability to address the homeless situation through the assistance of this measure while most of the money is distributed on a competitive grant basis there are a handful of programs which are funded on a formula derived basis i have obtained tentative figures for the amount which would be made available to west virginia on three of these programs of the 225 million provided for emergency fiscal year 1987 funds for programs administered by the housing and urban development 100 million would be for the emergency shelter grants program this program provides grants for the renovation rehabilitation or conversion of buildings into emergency shelters to expand the supply of shelters for the homeless hud distibutes the grants to local governments which can use the grants themselves or distribute funds to private charitable organizations up to 15 percent of these grants can also be used for supportive services for the homeless such as job counseling and health services under the bill grant applicants could apply for a waiver of this 15percent cap on supportive services funding if appropriated roughtly 739 000 of this money would go to west virginia approximately 523 000 would be at the governors discretion while the following amounts would be allocated to the accompanying major cities 67 000 to charleston 70 000 to huntington 32 000 to parkersburg and 47 000 to wheeling the bill authorizes atotal of 70 million in additional fiscal year 1987 funds for an existing food and shelter program and for the community services block grant program to provide food shelter and services to the homeless 50 million of this would be authorized for the community services block grant program administered by the health and humanservices department the 50 million would be reserved for services for the homeless and would be given only to local community action agencies that are already providing services food and shelter to the homeless an estimated 538 000 of this amount would be distributed in west virginia the remaining 20 million of this 70 million is earmarked for the ongoing emergency food and shelter program administered by the federal emergency management agency this program provides funds to charitable organizations and local governments that run food and shelter programs for the homeless roughly 224 100 of this money would go to west virginia with approximately 17 100 at the governors discretion the counties in my congressional district would receive roughly 60 000 of this amount the amounts of federal funds that are being discussed to address the homelessness crisis are minimal when compared to the overall size of the federal budget the cost of h r 558 is in fact less than half the cost of one trident submarine furthermore federal dollars spent now can avoid higher costs to the federal treasury later initiatives taken now to prevent the growing number of families and working poor from becoming homeless in the first place will reduce future public expenditures to help move these people back into mainstream society studies have shown that every additional week spent without a home tends to create further dependency only adding to the ultimate bill paid by american taxpayers with homelessness getting worse by the month it makes fiscal sense for the federal government to target resources to reverse this trend before the cost in lives and dollars gets still worse finally providing the minimum needed for survival is one of the core responsibilities of government just as the federal government has a responsibility to protect the country against foreign attack it also has a responsibility to assure that everyone can be sheltered and fed at least at minimum levels while some government programs should be curtailed or eliminated in the fact of budget deficits giving people a place to sleep at night and food to survive are not luxury items in a decent society the united states as the worlds richest democracy can surely provide its citizens with the basic requirements for physical survival in this vein i cosponsored h r 558 i will support its passage and urge my colleagues to join me and the bills other many supporters in this effort"],

the house approved on monday we have worked out our differences with the senate bill and are proposing an amendment to the senatepassed nutrition initiative as a way to expedite final congressional action on an urgently needed nutrition initiative this bipartisan amendment which we have developed retains the basic approach in the house legislationto get nutrition assistance to lowincome americans who depend on the food stamp and temporary emergency food assistance programs as quickly as possible without increasing the administrative complexity of the programs the major provisions of the proposed amendment willfirst extend for 2 years the temporary emergency food assistance program second require the unitedstates department of agriculture to purchase 120 million dollars worth of commodities in both fiscal years 1989 and 1990 to distribute to the needy to compensate for the reduced availability of cheese and other commodities in recent months third require the unitedstates department of agriculture to purchase 112 million dollars worth of commodities over the next 3 years which are earmarked specifically for food banks and soup kitchens which serve the homeless fourth increase basic food stamp benefits for each recipient above the normal inflation adjustment by an average of 1 5 cents a day in fiscal year 1989 5 cents a day in fiscal year 1990 and 8 cents a day in fiscal year 1991 fifth provide additional information to the needy about food stamps and reduce unnecessary paperwork for applicants sixth reduce barriers to participation in the food stamp program for farmers migrants and seasonal farm workers the elderly and the disabled seventh improve the efficiency of the food stamp program by reforming the quality control system so that judicial and administrative appeals are expedited and the number of states and the amount of claims levied on each state is substantially reduced eighth improve nutrition assistance to our nations children by increasing the reimbursement rate for the school breakfast program allowing an extra meal or snack in child care programs and ensuring that lowincome homeless children and mothers have access to the wic program ninth increase the reimbursement for day care expenses in the food stamp employment and training program and the deduction for day care expenses in the food stamp program to better reflect actual costs this is a good compromise it retains the essence of the house approach which was to increase food stamp benefits across the board the amendment raises food stamp benefits to 103 percent of the thrifty food plan as approved by the house to stay within budget limits the increase is phased in over 3 years the amendment responds to the fact that food stamp benefit adjustments are made each october based on food prices the previous june this means that the purchasing power of food stamp recipients always lags behind food price increases this problem will be exacerbated because of the food price inflation we can expect from the drought while the amount of commodities which would be purchased for tefap is higher than the house bill the compromise includes the house priority for food banks and soup kitchens which aid the homeless the house provisions to reduce barriers to participation in the food stamp program were retained and a number of senate provisions to reduce barriers to participation which have little or no cost were picked up we were able to obtain significant work incentives similar to what the house had included last year in the food stamp title of welfare reform and the senate included in its nutrition initiative these include an increase in the dependent care deduction to 160 a month for each dependent current law allows only 160 regardless of the number of dependents we also direct the department of agriculture to develop outcomebased performance standards for the food stamp employment and training program the compromise allows food stamp employment and training funds to be used to improve basic skills or otherwise improve employability including educational programs determined by the state agency to expand the job search abilities or employability of those participating in food stamp employment and training activities the compromise requires that funds made available for this purpose may not be used to supplant nonfederal funds used for existing services and activities of this type the compromise also institutes a requirement for a conciliation procedure to resolve disputes about participation in the food stamp employment and training program this provision formalizes the current procedures that is when state agencies find that there has been noncompliance in meeting a required employment and training component the state agency will attempt to contact the noncomplying household member to determine if there is good cause for the noncomplience only if no good cause is found ould a notice of adverse action be seait nothing in this provision is to be construed as enabling a delay in sending the notice or otherwise lengthening the adverse action process the compromise retains two important commodity provisions included in the house bill first the amendment requires that the secretary solicit applications from eligible agencies for donation of excess section 416 commodities held in usda inventories these commodities would be over and above normal quantities allocated to tefap and would be processed by the receiving agency into usable end products suitable for distribution with regular tefap foods the amendment also authorizes the unitedstates department of agriculture through the extension service to give technical assistance to states that desire to establish gleaning clearinghouses these clearinghouses would collect and distribute information about the kinds amounts and locations of agricultural products foods and meals so that these items can be distributed to needy families and individuals the house bill had authorized a national gleaning clearinghouse the department of agriculture opposed this approach as administratively infeasible so the compromise agreed to was for the federal government to provide technical assistance to states that desire to establish such gleaning clearinghouses the house bill included a contingency clause so that if budget sequestration takes place the cost provisions of this bill will not be implemented the senate negotiators were adamantly opposed to this provision the compromise reached was to make the provisions which have a significant cost in fiscal year 1989 subject to the sequestration provisions of the deficit control act of 1985 these provisions include the increase in the food stamp thrifty food plan in fiscal year 1989 the purchase of commodities for tefap required by section 110 of the amendment and the purchase of commodities for food banks and soup kitchens in fiscal year 1989 required by section 120 of the amendment in addition the other fiscal year 1989 cost provisions relating to tefap commodities and food stamps would not be implemented until october 1 1989 if a sequestration order were to be issued this october i want to emphasize that this provision is a not intended to establish in any way a precedent that the basic ongoing food stamp program should be subject to sequestration only the increase above current law would be subject to sequestration and this only for 1 year this is a onetime emergency provision designed to allow us to deal with the hunger emergency while sending a signal that increased spending over current law should not be immune if other ongoing programs are being cut as a result of sequestration the amendment is consistent with the budget resolution the food stamp and tefap mandatory spending pro t16842 visions are 274 million in fiscal year 1989 521 million in fiscal year 1990 and 549 million in fiscal year 1991 for each year these costs are below the allocation in the budget resolution to function 60u income security for a nutrition initiative in addition the budget committee will allocate from function 950 allowances sufficient funding to cover the child nutrition provisions in this amendment these costs are 10 million in fiscal year 1989 36 million in fiscal year 1990 and 41 million in fiscal year 1991 this amendment is a balanced and responsible effort to meet the hunger emergency in america i urge your support of this amendment"], [0.49195677042007446, 0.5080432295799255, 1, "it has been a pleasure to discuss the matter yesterday the nation mourned the first anniversary of the tragic death of seven brave americans who lost their lives when the space shuttle challenger exploded over cape canaveral over the course of the past year much attention has been given to the dramatic implications of the shutdown of our shuttle operations attention has been focused on the impact of the shuttle accident on military space activities on commercial space efforts and on the future of the nations space program in general of all the areas where the shuttle accident has taken a heavy toll however the area of space science has probably been hit the hardest already in a sorry state prior to the shuttle disaster the nations space science program is now in a state of crisis in this special order the second in a series i am conducting on the nations space program i will be focusing on the status of our space science program this is an area that deserves considerable attention at the present time given the bleak situation that now prevails indeed if steps are not taken soon to correct the situation facing space science within the next decade the united states will see itself surpassed in space science by the soviet union by the european space agency and possibly by the space programs of other nations which are reaching for the heavens with impressive vigor some unitedstates space scientists already feel that the united states has lost its preeminence in this arena reports issued last year by the national academy of sciences space science board and by nasas space and earth sciences advisory committee both reached the conclusion that the nations competitive position in space science is now in question the report from the nasa advisory committee was especially alarming given that most of the documentwhich describes a program in almost complete disarraywas completed prior to the shuttle accident since the accident the situation has gotten much much worse although nasa was conceived as an agency for research and development efforts in the space sciences the past decade has confronted the nations top space scientists with a growing sense of frustration disillusion and outright anger space science efforts of all kinds have been terminated postponed delayed and scaled back the hopes and expectations of established space researchers have been dashed on so many occasionsas the result of program cancellations and stretchoutsthat some have simply thrown in the towel and left the field and now with the added frustrations caused by the shuttle accident it will be increasingly difficult to attract new talent to the field for without the prospect of new space science launches which provide the data necessary for young researchers to establish a space science career talented graduate students that otherwise would look to nasa for a future will look elsewhere instead if this occursand it will occur unless action is taken to get the nations space science program back on trackthen the united states will fall even further behind in a field that has brought this nation some of its greatest triumphs what this nation has accomplished over the past 25 years in the field of space science and exploration is simply astounding we have gone from the days when primitive satellites first circled the globe to an era when satellites are absolutely indispensible for communications weather forecasting mapping the globe and keeping the peace between the worlds superpowers we have gone from the first efforts to send a spacecraft to another planet to the present day when we can successfully send a scientific probe billions of miles into space to fly past some of the most distant planets in our solar system and out into the uncharted reaches of the universe what space science provides this nation is not simply prestige in one of the most dramatic and important areas of science and technology although it provides plenty of that nasas space science efforts provide indispensible advances in our endless search for information about our planets past its future and its place in time currently however the nations prestige and leadership in space science are jeopardized moreover unless action is taken soon to correct this situation nasas spectacular accomplishments of the past 25 years will simply fade on the pages of history books what is needed is a new national commitment to leadership in space science such leadership will require specific policy statements made from the nations highest office the office of the president leadership in space science will also require real funding increases for nasas space science and exploration programs in both of these areaspolicy guidelines and budget supportthe reagan administration has been deficient space science has languished during this administrations 6year reign although it is not too late to change that situation indeed in looking at the presidents budget request for nasa for fiscal year 1988 a few hopeful signs can be identified on the whole however the administrations 1988 budget request includes little that would alter the state of decline of our nations space science effort for the interest of my colleagues i would like to provide a survey of the administrations budget request for 1988 with an eye specifically focused on the space science areas my attention will be focused on other portions of the nasa budget during future special orders january 29 1987 in aggregate terms the administrations budget request for nasa for fiscal year 1988 seems generous calling for a 13percent increase in funding over the fiscal year 1987 budget level much of this increase would help the agency recover from the shuttle accident it would pay for additional personnel to ensure better safety procedures and would continue the redesign efforts necessary to get the shuttle back into operation these funding increases are necessary and important in the section of nasas budget responsible for space science and exploration however the administrations funding request represents an actual decline from last years level the office of space science and applications effort has been zeroed out completely and the mars observer program is being delayed by 2 years acts is a research project to test a number of key technologies that could vastly improve the communications satellites in use today communications satellites are rapidly reaching their saturation point of orbital slots and frequency bands acts would use scanning beams controlled by the baseband processor which would automatically illuminate only those portions of the country which receive or trasmit messages these beams are rapidly formed and exist only for the time required the results in an optimum use of the frequency spectrum and maximizes the potential data throughput in other words acts would have the capacity of more than five typical private sector communications satellites even though the acts program has received half its overall funding the administration would zero out the program for the second year in a row the administrations position is that the private sector should do its own research while it is true that the private sector is capable and in most cases willing to do its own research it simply does not have the resources necessary to compete with governmentsponsored research programs in europe and japan other countries have aggressive programs in advanced communications technology and plan to deploy advanced technology satellites in the early 1990s japan in fact has had an operational advanced technology satellite in orbit since 1983 the administrations failure to support the acts program raises serious questions about the future of our nations satellite communications industry for instance will american telecommunications firms purchase their future satellites from tokyo although the telecommunication field is not a major unitedstates industry it is not a miniscule effort either and losing the market in this area to other countries seems absurdespecially since the united states did so much to create and develop the field of telecommunications at this stage of the acts program the administration is playing an irresponsible numbers game with the budget by cutting acts the administration is putting congress in the difficult position of either compromising other nasa programs in order to keep acts alive or increasing the overall nasa budget and risk public criticism for overspending an investment of 85 million in acts is necessary during fiscal year 1988 if this money has to be reprogrammed from other space science efforts it will simply cause more damage to the overall program of additional concern in the administrations proposed budget for fiscal year 1988 is the cutback in the mars observer program which would deal a clear setback to the unitedstates planetary exploration effort and international cooperation in space the focus of the mars mission is on the longterm characterization of the martian surface and atmosphere the mars observer program was to be the first of a series of lowcost planetary missions which were outlined in 1983 by nasas solar system exploration committee but because nasa proposes to delay launching the mission from 1990 to 1992 the cost of the program will grow substantially undermining the costeffectiveness criteria of the mission in addition the upper stage and spacecraft are under fixedcost contractsa strong incentive for nasa to remain on schedule to keep the mars mission on track for 1990 would require 50 million but an increased cost for the program is not the only concern delay in launching the mars observer will introduce a proportionate delay in the next unitedstates space exploration mission this will further despirit the nations space science community which faced with setback after setback already is losing some of its top researchers delaying the mars observer will also relinquish to the soviet union the united states lead in the exploration of mars the united states sent the first unmanned probe to mars in 1964 the first orbiter to mars in 1971 and the first landing craft to mars in 1976 now however the soviet union is about to take control of exploring the red planet two soviet missions to mars and its moons are scheduled for 1988 and 1992 placing the united states spacecraft launch between the soviet missions would allow for continuous monitoring of mars for 6 years or more the science of both nations would be greatly enhanced with this coordination indeed such cooperation could help lay the groundwork for a series of increasingly ambitious united statessoviet cooperative efforts in space leading to a joint manned mission to mars keeping the mars observer on track for a 1990 launch and starting plans for more ambitious missions to mars should be our goal if nasa cant find room on the shuttle for a 1990 launch of the mars observerdue to a reduced flight rate and crowding on the shuttle because of backlogged military spacecraftthen nasa should look to utilize an expendable launch vehicle elv congress and nasa have been pushing the need for a mixed launch fleet to assure access to space numerous space scientists have been urging that elvs be procured for space science and exploration missions launching the mars observer on an elv would make perfect sense as the nations returns toward a mixed launch fleet policy nasa has completed a comprehensive study of civilian mixed fleet requirements and options for purchasing elvs for the purpose of launching science payloads to make up for the launch hiatus and reduced launch schedule a number of space science missions can easily be modified to fly on elvs options for giving nasa a truly mixed fleet capability would require between 70 million and 300 million per year over the next 5 years we need this additional launch capability and must not delay a decision to move forward with assigning science missions to elvs and begin the elv procurement process nasa has requested the purchase of only one delta rocket in fiscal year 1988 to launch its cosmic background explorer additional elvs should be ordered the only new project recommended to begin development in the fiscal year 1988 nasa budget is the global geospace mission this will be the unitedstates contribution to the international solarterrestlal physics program a global effort to study the interaction of the sunearth system japan and europe are also participating in this multinational effort this effort will contribute to improving international space science and deserves strong support one of the few science missions scheduled for launch by the space shuttle in fiscal year 1988 is the hubble space telescope ehstj which will provide the ability to see seven times further into the universe than any telescope before it indeed the advent of the hubble telescope has been compared to the invention of the simple telescope about 370 years ago what is not commonly understood about the hubble telescope however is that it is simply one of four great observatories scheduled to orbit the earth the combined capability of the four telescopes will allow astrophysicists to view the universe through every band of the light spectrum gamma rays x rays ultraviolet visible light infrared and radio following the deployment of the hubble telescope will be the gamma ray observatory gro to be launched in 1990 the advanced xray astrophysics facility and the space infrared telescope facility are the remaining two observatories and have not yet been funded the images from these four telescopes will provide an incredible new view and hence new understanding of the universe it is encouraging that the hubble telescope is scheduled to fly in 1988 with the gamma ray observatory to follow soon after but the fate of the other two space observatories remain uncertain after being in the wings for several years nasa recommended that development work on the advanced xray astrophysics facility begin in fiscal year 1988 but the administration decided the program could be delayed ignoring the fact that the true value of the observatories will be their ability to work simultaneously delays in launching elements of the entire system will greatly compromise the quality of the science another space science program which is consistently bumped to the back burner is the comet rendezvous and asteroid flyby craf probe this program should have been in the fiscal year 1987 nasa budget to start development work but the administration rejected a new start on the program in fiscal year 1987 and has done so again in the fiscal year 1988 budget craf is also a recommended project of the solar system exploration committee similar to the mars observer the craf technology would be used in a series of mediumcost solar system explorers if the probe was ready for a 1992 launch it could rendezvous with the comet temple 2 on december 11 1996 near the orbit of jupiter the spacecraft would match the velocity of the comet and remain with it as it travels around the sun this project would provide a constant stream of data over a matter of weekscompared to the mission of comet halley which only had a brief ecounter with the comet if the administration is serious about revitalizing space science it could demonstrate this seriousness by supporting the comet rendezvous and asteroid flyby probewhich is a high priority for space scientists while numerous ossa activities would be put on hold in fiscal year 1988 other portions of nasas research and development effort would fare somewhat better the space station program is earmarked to receive 767 million next year although less than the 1 billion which nasa originally requested it still represents a healthy increase for the program as the space station effort prepares to begin construction this year problems with international cooperation are becoming more complex indecisiveness at this point in the stations development could lead some legislators to see the space station as a place to cut federal spending i would hate to see this happen and thus i am deeply concerned about delays in the space station effort the most recent holdup in the space station effort is the pentagons sudden interest in using the station as a tool of the military dod interest has stalled nasas negotiations with the space stations main partners europe japan and canada after years of stated opposition to the station the defense department has decided that it wishes to leave its options open for military use of the orbiting lab dods involvement could raise a fundamental question about whether the orbiting lab is for civilian or military purposes if the latter is the case our international partners may want out of the project this may be fine with the pentagon but the action could drive a deeper wedge between the united states and other spacefaring nations while nasa is in the middle of negotiations with dod and its foreign partners over security issues of the space station scientists have voiced concern about the stations scientific utility during the early manned operations the nasa space station task force has been very critical of the stations initial operating capability fewer anticipated shuttle launches reduced crew size and increased dependence on the shuttle are making scientists worry that the science on the space station will be greatly diminished the low launch rate of the shuttle once it resumes flight will allow for fewer preparatory missions for space science before the station is ready for january 29 1 987 example less frequent shuttle flight will allow a handful of the spacelab missions needed to prepare science programs for the space station as a result many of the missions going on the station may be first generation experiments nasa has reduced the initial operating crew of the space station down to four from the planned number of six to eight this cut in personnel will seriously diminish scientific productivity on the station in addition to fewer crew members a very high percentage of the shuttles mid1990s missions will be dedicated to space station assembly which could frustrate even further our nations ability to conduct space science in orbit for this reason nasa should seriously consider a heavy lift vehicle to be used for station deployment a number of viable and costeffective options have been proposed for heavy lift capability this approach would be good for space science as well as for the integrity of the overall space program the space station has been called the next logical step in space implied in this statement is that the station is only part of a much larger space infrastructure which one day will extend to the moon and the outer planets while the space station is in the throes of reexamination nasa is taking steps in the fiscal year 1988 budget to improve the technology base needed to build future parts of this space infrastructure nasa is proposing the civil space technology initiative to do basic research on propulsion space vehicles science sensors large space structures power and automation and robotics with these technology building blocks we will be able to assemble an infrastructure as outlined in the report of the national commission on space in its report the commission on space takes a visionary look at the next 50 years in space beyond the space station the report tells of permanent bases in a variety of earth orbits and on the moon to enhance space science and commerce a vehicle that could ferry between the space stations is the orbital transfer vehicle the nasp is a project which will culminate in the construction of a research vehicle with the ability to take off from a conventional runway and achieve necessary velocities to place itself into orbit the civil space technology initiative and the aerospace plane are encouraging efforts but absent from the fiscal year 1988 budget was reference to any specific longterm goals in space the administration has failed to address the fact that nasa has operated without agencywide direction since the days of the apollo program the national commission on space along with all the major space policy advisory bodies has concluded that the space program lacks leadership and longrange goals this lack of direction in the space program due to the absence of a policy statement providing guidance is what is killing the nations space science program for without an overarching planlaying out longrange objectives priorities and timelinesit is impossible to keep space science and exploration programs from being sacrificed year after year as the result of diffused and directionless decisionmaking fortunately there are indications that the administration will come forth with a new vision for space this year we will welcome the presidents leadership when it comes but we could have used it months ago a coherent policy is essential to responsible budget oversight in the absence of clear goals the fiscal year 1988 nasa budget suffers from many of the same pitfalls that have plagued the agency for more than a decade rebuilding the shuttle program out of the challenger ashes must take priority in the fiscal year 1988 nasa budget unfortunately the cost of the shuttle recovery effort is cutting into the research and development function of nasa especially the office of space science and applications the cancellation of the acts program undermines the american drive toward international competitiveness the delay in the mars observer will drive up costs for the program cause delays in subsequent exploration missions and jeopardize unitedstates leadership in the exploration of mars for space science and applications to flourish it will be necessary to ensure that projects once approved will not be subject to cutbacks delays or cancellation of additional importance priority must be given to creating a stimulating and opportunityrich environment that helps attract retain and inspire young space scientists in this regard the next 5 years will be critical since opportunities for science activities aboard the space shuttle will be limited procuring elys for space exploration missions and for suborbital space projects could provide a significant boost to the field of space science additionally more money should be invested in the analysis of data gathered from past missions this could provide the fodder to help hang on to the talented young researchers that will be needed if this nation hopes to regain its stature as the world leader in space science when the space shuttle challenger exploded in flames 1 year ago the nation was left with a sense of emptiness the tragedy devastated the optimism and sense of derringdo that had previously been a trademark of the unitedstates space program we must now work to regain the optimism sense of direction and dedication to leadership the seven astronauts who lost their lives in the challenger accident could hardly have hoped for more indeed what better tribute could possibly be paid to those seven brave americans than a reinvigorated bold space program that invokes awe and amazement not only in the united states but around the world the time to set out such a program is now and i urge my fellow colleagues to embrace such an effort the reward for doing so will be experienced by generations to come i wish to express my very deep thanks to the distinguished

highest praise to all the house and senate members who negotiated until very late in the night this entire last week to reach an agreement it is extremely difficult for those of us who oppose the death penalty to vote for a bill with the death penalty in it but the nations deepening drug crisis and the administrations lack of any legislative initiative on their own make the expansion of antidrug programs under this bill necessary the bill includes a number of badly needed actions in drug law enforcement health care and foreign policy while over 2 billion is authorized for 1989 the grammrudman deficit ceiling only permits spending of 500 million this fiscal year to those who say we are not spending enough this year let me say they are rightbut it is only the beginning the legislation includes programs for the next few fiscal years next year when we are not forced into an endofthecongress situation as we are now i intend to fight for full funding i am very pleased with those parts of the legislation which were carefully studied and crafted in advance without the counterproductive rush of amendments to prove how tough on drugs the congress can be i am pleased the final version includes assistance to state and local drug enforcement enhancement in drug treatment including preventing the spread of aids through intravenous drug abuse increases for schoolbased drug prevention efforts and innovative drug education programs targeted at youth gangs disadvantaged youth runaways homeless youth and other hardtoreach populations assistance to the drug enforcement administration customs the coast guard and other federal enforcement agencies a call for a western hemisphere drug summit and an international antldrug strike force opposition to legalization of illicit narcotics and many other fine antidrug programs i am very pleased the agreement includes a national director of drug policy a socalled drug czar under the current administration we have never known who was in charge of dealing with the nations drug crisis now we will because this individual will coordinate enforcement prevention and foreign policy aspects of our war on drugs there are still provisions in the bill i do not supportspecifically inclusion of the death penalty taking away federal benefits of drug users improved however from the house version because of allowing discretion and allowing the next president to review the provision and imposing civil fines against drug users although improved by allowing appeal to a criminal court the house narcotics committee which i chair will monitor this entire legislation to see what is working and what is not i am extremely concerned about saying we will win the war against drugs by waging it against millions of our citizens we are not locked into any of these provisions and we can and will continually make changes it is unfortunate that no leadership came from the white house on antidrug legislation either this time or before the omnibus drug bill in 1986 that is why the congress has been in the forefront of fashioning a comprehensive response to the drug crisis facing our nation without any guidance from the administration this year as our nations drug problem escalated i had hoped that the administration would advise us how to improve the 1986 bill i hoped the secretary of education would give us a plan for drug education i hoped the secretary of health and human services would give us a strategy for treatment and rehabilitation i hoped the secretary of state would tell us what we need for a vigilant international antidrug effort i hoped the attorney general would advise us how to improve federal enforcement as well as provide much needed help to hard pressed state and local police in combatting drugrelated crime in our cities and communities but we didnt hear from any of them once again congressional leaders had to act to address the drug crisis therefore speaker waiht majority leader thomas foley and minority leader michel deseve our highest praise for initiating the congressional response this year as does the senate leadership for ensuring senate action on this very important issue i want to say a few words about the funding for state and local drug enforcement included in this bill two years ago i sponsored legislation to provide federal funding to assist state and local drug enforcement efforts this program was substantially incorporated into the antidrug abuse act of 1986 earlier this year i introduced legislation to alter the allocation of funds under this program so that eligible units of local government could receive awards directly i did this because many local officials including mayors and police chiefs complained to the select committee on narcotics that local officials were not adequately consulted in the preparation of statewide drug enforcement plans as required under the 1986 act that states did not give adequate consideration to local durg enforcement priorities in developing statewide plans that funds were longdelayed in coming from the state to the local level and that many localities did not receive a share of funds proportionate to the resources and efforts they were expending on drug enforcement efforts the house omnibus drug bill incorporated the concept of direct funding to localities it required states to pass through federal funds directly to local governments eligible for awards of 25 000 or more based on a localitys criminal justice spending relative to such spending by all other units of local government within the state the original senate bill included a similar passthrough to localities with a population of 500 000 or more but tids provision was dropped i participated in the housesenate negotiations to reconcile these differing positions conference negotiators were unable to reach an acceptable compromise and decided not to change the current allocation formula at this time members of both bodies agree however that the congress should reconsider this issue next year the lack of sufficient funding to appropriate the full amounts authorized for this program was a major factor in this decision some have said that a direct passthrough would make it impossible for states to coordinate programs and allocate funds to those areas with the greatest need the issue however is not one of need versus entitlement it would be hard to find an area of our country today that does not face critcal unmet needs in drug enforcement the question is whether local law enforcement and criminal justice officials who are in the frontline trenches of our nations drug war will be able to receive and use their share of these federal moneys to address their highest priority drug enforcement needs in the 1983 act congress intended to help both states and local governments meet their most pressing drug enforcement problems coordination of state and local efforts is an important goal but in too many cases it appears that local priorities have not been given sufficient consideration congress should act quickly next year to remedy this situation i yield such time as he may consume to the

congress observance of national foreign language week this commemorative occasion is intended to highlight the growing significance of foreign language education and training for americans at all ages and from any walks of life a similar special order will be observed in the other body by senator christopher j dodo of connecticut for every year since 1957 the first week of march has been proclaimed national foreign language week yet an official congressional designation has never been proposed given the growing internationalism in the conduct of american economic and political affairs and the decline in federal dollars available to support needed international education programs i believe that it is more urgent than ever that the congress reaffirm its support for foreign language study i have been an advocate of international education programs for a long time andhave continually worked to protect such programs from attempted cutbacks and eliminations our future national security and economic prosperity depend on our ability to communicate with our foreign counterparts as technology shrinks the distances separating the nations of the world we find ourselves dealing with foreign nationals with greater and greater frequency across the negotiating table in our laboratories through business deals and in academic conferences we place ourselves at an immediate disadvantage by our limited ability to communicate we must wake up and recognize that english is no longer the only game in town one of the key themes and tasks for this congress is restoring americas competitiveness in a highly complex and competitive world improving our foreign langauge training capability is a concrete and attainable goal in the context of international trade and our place in this world japans remarkable recovery since the end of the war has been the greatest economic success story of the century much to the chagrin of many of her competitors the success can be attributed to a number of factors but i do not think that we can underestimate the importance of japans international marketing strategies including especially its strong emphasis on other languages and cultures the japanese have deliberately prepared their businessmen and other professionals to operate in a global marketplace with multicultural customers they have learned the language analyzed the needs grasped the culture and tried to understand the basic psyche of all potential consumers it is estimated that there are 10 000 japanese businessmen who speak english in the united states while only about 1 000 american businessmen are in japan most of whom can not speak the language unitedstates companies for the most part have marketed their products abroad american style american advertising campaigns have not been as effective as they could be because we have not taken the time to understand international audiences for example in italy advertisements for schweppes tonic translated the product as bathroom water a cocacola ad was phonetically translated into chinese characters as bite the wax tadpole and chevrolet marketing executives were stumped as to why their nova car was not selling in spain until they finally realized that nova translated into spanish means does not go we have committed countless careless thoughtless and costly mistakes which have done nothing for american prestige let alone product sales the language of business must be the language of the customer yet in only a small percentage of the nations business schools are courses in foreign languages or international affairs required we simply are not preparing these business majors for the future likewise our scientists and engineers are quickly finding that the latest breakthroughs in their fields are no longer occurring exclusively in english speaking countries or being reported only in english language journals the need for bi or trilingualism is no less acute in the diplomatic sector the important role of first rate interpreters and translators was dramatically demonstrated at the recent summit meetings but in addition to these highly skilled linguists what a difference it would make if each embassy and consulate around the world was staffed with professional diplomats who had a working knowledge of the native languageor at least the ability to learn but the foreign service requires absolutely no prior foreign language experience as a prerequisite for entry into the corps in short foreign language study should no longer be limited to foreign language majors students themselves are beginning to realize that knowledge of certain key languages will make them more attractive to potential employers accordingly enrollment in collegelevel japanese courses increased 40 2 percent from 1980 to 1983 this trend must be encouraged and expanded to encompass all languages of the world japans is not the only market in which we will compete in the years ahead commerce in the middle east for example will grown increasingly significant to say nothing of its strategic value yet over that same 198083 period the number of students studying arabic actually declined by 0 9 percent higher education institutions should broaden their foreign language programs and make minimum language competency a requirement although some colleges and universities are beginning to reinstitute language requirements that were dropped in the late sixties and early seventies the federal government must encourage them to continue along this path our nation needs both broadbased competency and indepth specialization in international languages and affairs our educational institutions must be prepared to meet these dual needs on an unprecedented scale the federal government must provide the leadership to encourage this trend encouraging increased foreign language enrollments and requirements maintaining and upgrading teachers language skills and promoting hands on experience abroad will help to set these wheels in motion when president reagan met with general secretary gorbachev of the soviet union in geneva in 1985 these two leaders did agree on one indisputable fact in spite of the great differences between our nations the future security of the world depends on the mutual understanding between the american and soviet peoples the only signed agreement to come out of those meetings was a pact to increase cultural and academic exchanges in pledging their commitment to this new initiative mr reagan and mr gorbachev recognized that sovietamerican cultural awareness should not be limited to a few toplevel kremlinologists and americanologists in the upper reaches of power in the two countries the mutual understanding should filter through to all corners of society it is

am pleased to have the opportunity today to introduce h r 2295 legislation which would modify one of the rules in subchapter m of the internal revenue code subchapter m governs the taxation of mutual funds technically known as regulated investment companies or rics the federal income tax provision applicable to mutual funds were first enacted in 1936 although certain amendments to subchapter m were adopted as part of the 1986 tax reform act the basic structure and principles of these provisions have remained generally unchanged these tax provisions have worked reasonably well over the years however a changing marketplace and the emergence of new investment vehicles requires a future update of one of the tax rules governing the mutual fund industry to allow the industry to better serve the mutual fund shareholder the legislation well be introducing today would repeal section 851 b 3 of the internal revenue code an archaic unduly restrictive provision of the law which inhibits the ability of mutual fund managers to perform in a manner which best serves the funds shareholders this legislation will permit the mutual fund manager to respond more fully and directly to the changing financial marketplace it will make available to mutual fund investors typically~middleincome americans some of the same opportunities available to 1 the generally more wealthy direct investor such as the opportunity to have portfolio diversification and access to the investment community while providing a significant benefit to mutual fund investors this bill is revenue neutral moreover the treasury department last year stated its support for the proposed repeal of section 851 b 3 the tax treatment of mutual funds is based on the conduit theory generally the fund flows through to its shareholders the income and gain derived from the securities held in the funds portfolio the distributed income and gain is taxed at the shareholder level rather than at the fund level provided that the fund meets certain tests for qualification under subchapter m of the code failure to satisfy the stringent requirements of subchapter m will cause a mutual fund to be subject to the full corporate tax imposed under subchapter c of the code although the provisions of subchapter m have not required significant change since their adoption in 1936 a number of developments in recent years have made the socalled shortshort rule of code section 851 b 3 outmoded and unresponsive to the modern financial climate this bill would repeal section 851 b 3 the provision of the code which states that a mutual fund will not be eligible for conduit tax treatment if 30 percent or more of its gross income is derived from gain on the sale of stock or securities held for less than 3 months although the 1986 tax reform act included a provision which would permit the netting of offsetting gains and losses in certain designated hedge transations for purposes of computing gain under section 851 b 3 the relief provided by this amendment was indequate and unnecessarily burdensome to administer the provisions of section 851 b 3 continue to restrict a mutual fund managers ability to respond to modern financial conditions for example we have recently seen the introduction of such new investment products as exchangetraded stock options options and futures on debt instruments and options and futures on foreign currencies the creation of these new products has at least in part been a response to the volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and the stock market these products which have become an integral part of all professional investment management are particularly useful in hedging against the risks of fluctuations in interest rates stock values and currency exchange rates mutual funds which are regulated by the securities and exchange commission should not be unduly restricted in the use of these modern ifivestment products by outmoded provisions of the internal revenue code even as recently revised code section 851 b 3 hinders the use of these products by mutual funds and thus hampers a mutual funds ability to protect its shareholders investments in a constantly changing financial environment section 851 b 3 was enacted at 4 time when products such as index options and futures financial futures and other new investment products did not exist and indeed were not even contemplated however in todays environment the rule thwarts a mutual fund managers fiduciary responsibility to act in the shareholders best interests first the rule prohibits a mutual fund from taking advantage of these new investment products even though they are used extensively by other investors second it imposes an unwarranted restriction on the funds ability to react and benefit from rapid changes in the market that is periods of volatile interest rates or when the value of securities increase abruptly thereby precipitating an artificial investment decision that may not be in the best interest of the mutual fund shareholder the following is an actual example of the adverse effects of this rule on mutual fund shareholders in 1981 a mutual fund took an extra long bond position because of the anticipated fall in interest rates interest rates did fall but more rapidly and more substantially than the fund anticipated in the face of a rapid interest rate reduction the fund would have benefited by closing out these positions within 2 months and by adopting a more defensive position however the fund was unable to close out the positions after only 2 months because it would have realized an impermissible gain under the 30percent rule for this and similar reasons and because it is in the best interest of the shareholders section 851 b 3 should be repealed as i mentioned previously the subchapter m provision of the code this bill would repeal was enacted with the revenue act of 1936 this provision was added along with the rest of subchapter m by the conference committee on the 1936 revenue measure this amendment to the 1936 laws was not the subject of public hearings prior to enactment or extensively discussed or even explained during floor debate on the measure in either body the legislative history of this law provides few clues to the derivation or purposes of the subchapter m provisions legal scholars and historians speculate that the subchapter m provisions were a reasonable response to the excesses of the unregulated marketplace of the 1920s and early 1930s that permitted investment companies to flaunt the public trust and secretly manipulate the prices fo individual stocks through excessive trading and selfdealing the excesses of the 1920s and early 1930s spurred congress to enact a number of reform measures between 1933 and 1940 over this brief 8year period congress worked continuously to reform the investment industry this reform movement produced the securities act of 1933 the securities exchange act of 1934 the investment company act of 1940 and the investment advisor act of 1940 the reform movement enacted a broad regulatory framework that carefully delineates monitors and controls every aspect of the activities of the mutual industry the regulatory framework is so thorough that by the mid1970s the chairman of the securities and exchange committee could tell the chairman of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs that no issuer of securities is subject to more detailed regulation than mutual funds the regulatory framework enacted by congress has proven to be sound public policy the mutual fund industry has grown and prospered the investing public has great confidence in the industry over 20 million americans now own shares in more than 2 000 mutual funds holding 800 billion in total assets the bill we are introducing today would not disturb this valuable regulatory framework it would be foolish to do so the purpose of this bill is to repeal an outmoded provision of tax law enacted in 1938 that no longer serves a purpose the treasury department expressed its support for the repeal of the shortshort rule last year in a letter to me dated february 5 1986 assistant secretary mentz stated that while section 851 b 3 does not serve a pressing tax policy goal it does impose substantial costs on rics and their shareholders both by requiring investment decisions to be made on noneconomic grounds and by forcing rics to monitor their compliance with the rule the subchapter m provisionthe socalled shortshort ruledoes not prohibit mutual funds form participating in futures and options trading it simply restricts earnings from such shortterm investments to 30 percent of total earnings the mutual funds have the authority to conduct futures and options trading hundreds of mutual funds do so in order to hedge against downside risk to quickly adjust equity exposure and to gain added return through arbitrage these"], [0.4921461343765259,

somewhat out of date because much change has already taken place over the past 5 years the goldwaternichols department of defense reorganization act of 1986 and the presidents blue ribbon commission on defense management better known as the packard commission have signaled such change h 6380 today i will describe the truly significant modifications that have taken place over the past 5 years with respect to the unitedstates defense establishment i will also try to give an idea of what changes can be expected as we look to the future defense reorganization as an issue goes back over 40 years to the mcnarney plan of 1944 and the subsequent integration of the services in the department of defense as part of the national security act of 1947 the genesis of the goldwaternichols act of 1986 can be directly traced to calls for fundamental change issued in 1982 by gen david jones chairman of the joint chiefg of staff and gen edward shy meyer army chief of staff both these articulate men called for fundamental changes in the operation of the joint chiefs of staff jcsj while still on active duty soon thereafter hearings began in the spring and summer of 1982 by the investigations subcommittee of the house armed services committee it was to become a long laborious process that soon looked at more than simply changes in the operation of the jcs reorganization of the military became such an important matter that it could not be left to the generals i introduced my own bill in 1983 after a close consultation with a number of experts including gen maxwell taylor who went over the bill i introduced line by line the senate was slow to deal with the issue until barry goldwater became chairman of the senate committee on armed services in january 1985 he and the ranking minority member at the time finally gave the issue the attention in the senate that it had lacked the changes brought about by the goldwaternichols act 4 years after the call for change by generals jones and meyer were the most significant changes in defense organization since the creation of the department of defense by way of the national security act of 1947 our whole effort can be summarized by wanting to insure that the services think jointly plan jointly train jointly so they can fight jointly and win let me now go through a description of the significant changes enacted last year that are now being put into effect first the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was designated the presidents principal military adviser previously the title of principal military adviser was held collectively by the joint chiefs of staff and as such any advice given the president reflected the compromised views of the chairman and the four military service chiefs the four services in effect wrote the plans and budgets after logrolling that led to the lowestcommondenominator positions now the chairman the only member of the joint chiefs with no service responsibilities who by the nature of his position reflects the joint multiservice perspective is able to give the independent military advice and planning that cuts across service lines the greater role envisioned for the chairman now includes giving him specifically the responsibility for developing strategic and contingency plans and budget proposals this responsibility was formerly held by the corporate body of the joint chiefs of staff second to help the chairman of the joint chiefs carry out his new duties the goldwaternichols act gave him control over the joint staff the group of about 400 staff officers that had previously assisted the chiefs as a body today the staff helps him in much the same way that each service chief has the resources of his own service staff make no mistake about this it is a significant increase in the authority in the power of the chairman to do the job that he has been given third the act also created the new position of vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the vice chairman and today that is general herres serves as acting chairman in admiral crowes absence and carries out whatever duties the chairman assigns him once again just as each service chief has a vice chief a trusted no 2 he can rely on so too the chairman needs such a partner and now he has him equally as important as the changes increasing the authority of the chairman were those measures that increased the authority of the 10 unified and specified commanders the national security act of 1947 led to the creation of a series of commands for example the european command the atlantic command the pacific command and the strategic alf command that would actually do the fighting in any future war the services were to recruit train and arm the troops and then turn them over to the commanders in chief the cincs of the unified commands who would direct the actual combat operations prior to the enactment of the goldwaternichols act the service chiefs determined the heads of each service component under a commander in chief this meant that the component commanders the army navy and air force commanders working for the cinc were subordinate to the cinc only in a nominal sense the actual lines of authority ran back to the service chief back in washington who controlled their rewards and punishments including promotions today this is no longer true as a result of the changes signed into law last year now each unified commander has veto power over his subordinates for the first time he also has control over all aspects of military operations interservice training and supplies as in the case of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff more authority more power was given to the cincs in order to let them do the job originally envisioned for them possibly the most significant and definitely the most contentious changes found in the goldwaternichols act were those in title iv they required the secretary of defense to establish an occupational category for officers involved in joint operations in the past officers detailed to joint duty for example those working on the joint staff at the pentagon or working on the staff of a unified commander were subject to pressures from their services to conform to service policy promotions future duty assignments and other rewards were all controlled by the services an officer serving in the joint arena promoting a policy at variance with his own services interests ran the risk of putting himself in jeopardy at promotion time as a result it was not hard to understand why bright ambitious officers sought duty on their own service staffs rather than on the joint staff serving in a joint billet could prove hazardous to their careers to break that reality the goldwaternichols act included a number of provisions designed to strengthen the appeal of serving in the joint arena it created a group of joint specialists whose primary duty will be joint operations to protect their promotions the service boards considering these officers must include at least one officer with a joint speciality who will be named by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff even more important the chairman will review all promotion board actions involving joint officers and will have the power to change the lists if he believes a service is seeking to punish an officer serving in a joint duty assignment the act also calls for the secretary of defense to designate at least 1 000 critical joint duty assignments that must always be filled by joint speciality officers the act requires that an officer may not be selected for the joint specialty until he completes a joint education program and a full joint tour these and other provisions in title iv show the importance given by congress to improving the joint multiservice perspective it is not hard to understand why the services fought this provision so strenuously the viewpoint of the joint perspective has been strengthened at the expense of the powerful service role and this is the portion of the goldwaternichols act that does the most to tilt the balance of power from the uniservice perspective to the joint multiservice perspective"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5090950727462769,

heart of our nations governmentthe greatest democracy the world has ever known fiftyfive delegates met in philadelphia during 4 hot and steamy summer months in 1787 to draft a document to govern our newly liberated nation the product of their efforts was not arrived at easily or without heated debate and it was very different than any constitution the world had ever known finally on september 17 1787 the debate was concluded compromises were completed and 39 delegates representing 12 states signed the constitution and sent it to the 13 states for their ratification it is this historic occasion we celebrate today with ceremonies at founders hlall in philadelphia and in each of our 50 states and thousands of communities and schools yesterday i had the privilege of taking part in a celebration of citizenship on the west front steps of our nations capitol this program served as a prelude to todays ceremonies and those of the next 4 years as we mark special events in the early days and months of this great governing document including its ratification by the states and its implementation by our forefathers the celebration yesterday was bursting with symbolism and characterized what has enabled the constitution to endure for two centuries gathered on the steps of our capitol were the president and his cabinet members the justices of the supreme court and members of congress the leaders of our three branches of government the president justices and members of congress are delegated three separate but equally important roles in our government which provide an intricate system of checks and balances to ensure that no one branch oversteps the bounds set forth in the constitution this sharing and division of power was unique to the world in 1787 for no nation had ever been governed under such a system our celebrations yesterday and today also provide a time to reflect on the words of the constitution and to marvel at the resiliency of this document although it is but a few pages long the constitution was so comprehensive and well drafted that it has had to be amended just 17 times by the american people the first 10 of the 26 amendments known as the bill of rights were ratified by the states just 4 years after the constitution was written and now provide for the basic freedoms and liberties for which our nation stands this document is so enduring that it is among the oldest constitutions governing any nation today it is even more remarkable when you consider that twothirds of all the worlds constitutions have been adopted in the past 17 years it is most appropriate that during this time of celebration the work of our nations governing bodies goes forth as established in the constitution the senate is in the midst of its consideration of the presidents nominee for a seat on the supreme court the congress is negotiating with the executive branch to reach agreement on a number of our nations important fiscal matters and the president and his key cabinet leaders continue their negotiations with world leaders on a number of major foreign policy questions perhaps just as symbolic as the functioning of our system of checks and balances is the way in which these matters are considered and debated diverse views and sharp rhetoric characterize each of these majors issues before the executive judicial and legislative branches this week that is however as the constitution would have it in protecting the rights of free speech for all americans the debate was no less heated or at times divisive 200 years ago as the delegates drafting the constitution sought grounds for compromise to achieve their goal of completing a governing document for our fledgling nation in fact three delegates so strongly disagreed with the final product that they refused to sign and one state refused to even send a delegation to philadelphia for these proceedings our constitution promotes debate and the airing of differing viewpoints and it stands apart from the socalled constitutions of other nations especially those of the communist bloc which say they provide for and protect the freedoms of speech religion and the press but are in reality totalitarian states that stifle these basic human rights our constitution also provides for the orderly transfer of power within the government and only allows for changes to this governing document with the consent of the governed this sharply contrasts with many nations where military juntas and coups forcefully bring about a change of power and where constitutions are drafted and discarded like old newspapers at the direction of autocratic fuleis or ruling parties certainly the strength of the concepts and words embodied in our constitution has enabled it to endure the test of time but these concepts and words are only as strong as the will of the people it governs this exceptional document which has served our nation well in times of prosperity as well as in times of crisis gathers its strength from the spirit and enthusiasm of the american people that spirit was in evidence yesterday as millions of people nationwide paused to recite together september 17 1987 co the pledge of allegiance children in our schools workers at construction sites and brokers on the floor of the new york stock exchange joined together one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all the constitution has so inspired the american people that thousands of men and women have laid down their lives over the years to protect the rights and privileges it guarantees this great document has also inspired people throughout the world millions of men women and children have sought refuge in our nation where they will be free to pray work and raise their families many more people living under communist tyranny have been inspired by the constitution to keep alive their dream to live in a land which provides for the same freedoms as we enjoy in the united states under our constitution every american plays a role in the governing of our nation the most basic right it guarantees is the right to vote on election day sadly enough many people throughout the world will never have the opportunity in their lifetimes to cast a ballot in a free election it has been a distinct privilege for me to serve the people of pinellas county fl as their elected representative to the unitedstates congress these past 17 years and it is a special honor to have been one of only 11 000 americans to have served in this great body as our nation begins in earnest its celebration of the constitution we are in the midst of celebrating for the next 2 years the convening last january of the historic 100th congress if there is one lesson to be learned from our celebration it is that we cannot and must not ever take our constitution for granted the struggle to gain and maintain the freedoms and liberties we enjoy today was too long and hard and we have paid a high price over the years to defend these rights as we have learned from history the protections afforded us under the constitution can all too quickly be snatched away and are difficult to regain our nation must remain firm in its resolve to remain strong to repel any challenge to our freedom i can assure you that this member of congress is committed to uphold his constitutional responsibility to provide for our national security the constitution has served our nation well for 200 years and it is incumbent upon each of us to ensure that it continues to serve future

the issue before us is curtailing espionage by foreign diplomats in the united states protecting our military secrets and advanced technology from our enemies is of vital interest to unitedstates national security however i unfortunately was forced to withdraw my amendment because of a conflict with the parliamentarian while this temporary setback leaves the issue of hostile diplomatic travel unresolved my colleagues can be sure that i will raise it again during next years state department authorization bill i had planned today to offer the antiespionage act of 1988 as an amendment to grant the secretary of defense and the fbi director authority over individual travel requests to the state departments office of foreign missions by diplomats from communist and terrorist countries in the united states my amendment affects all communist countries listed in section 620 q of the 1961 foreign assistance act and all countries determined by the secretary of state as terrorist for purposes of the 1979 export administration act specifically it states that individual travel requests in the united states by personnel of hostile foreign countries and entities shall not be permitted if the secretary of defense or the director of the federal bureau of investigation judges that such travel might enhance the capability of those countries or entities to intercept unitedstates military intelligence or diplomatic communicafions or engage in forms of human intelligence collection in either case the secretary of state and the director of central intelligence must be consulted instead of one executive branch authority having exclusive oversight of the travel requests of hostile foreign diplomats as in current law my amendment creates authority for two departments to review diplomatic travel both of which have responsibilities that are directly affected by such travel my amendment balances our national security interests with our political and diplomatic concerns by creating a system of checks and balances within the executive branch to oversee the travel requests of hostile intelligence operatives on american soil this amendment differs greatly from the travel restriction compromise reached in section 162 of last years state department authorization bill instead of imposing specific restrictions on entire missions like section 162 the antiespionage act of 1988 creates a process for reviewing individual cases of hostile diplomatic travel my amendment does not deprive the state department of any authority that it legitimately should have it rests on the principle that regulating the movement of spies in the united states should properly be the responsibility of those agencies concerned with counterintelligence and national securitynamely the fbi and defense department current law allows too little input on questions of individual travel from the agencies most affected by the trips of hostile intelligence personnel in the united states soviet travel within the united states increasingly will impinge directly upon defense department and fbi concerns with the inf treaty nuclear testing verification and possibly in the future with start there will be a great deal of onsite inspection travel and activity at or near defense and national security installations with the passage of the foreign missions act in 1982 congress gave the office of foreign missions the responsibility to decide between intelligence and reciprocity concerns in regulating diplomatic travel congress created ofm because of serious dissatisfaction with the state departments disregard for the intelligence and counterintelligence interests of the united states but in the time since ofm was established the state department has remained continuously hostile to the goals which congress intended to achieve in passing the foreign missions act the department has not fully implemented the fma and in some cases has even chosen to ignore the law completely for example it failed to implement section 162 of 1987s state department authorization bill until 8 weeks after the deadline and five months after the bill became law in finally applying the restrictions the department still chose to bypass such unitedstates intelligence threats as the hungarian and romanian missions to the u n similarly the state department has also chosen for 3 years not to fully implement the 1985 rothhyde amendment by allowing soviet members of the u n secretariat to travel to sensitive closed areas more recently state has been willing to grant travel requests and allow negotiations with a known kgb agent appointed to head a new unitedstatesunitedstatess r trade commissionthe obvious purpose being to improve the soviets efforts to acquire denied technology in other words smooth relations with the soviets took precedence over the damage and even the humiliation to the west the precedent for my amendment rests in section 161 of the 1987 state department authorization bill that section part of the bipartisan diplomatic reciprocity and security act of representatives fascell mica broomfield and snowe plugged the loophole in the law with respect to the acquisition of american property by hostile foreign diplomats by giving t defense department and fbi over future property acquisitions this was aimed at avoiding another scandal like soviet occupation of mount alto section 161 is identical to the substance of my amendment the only difference is that instead of avoiding the prospect of giving the soviets and their allies real property to spy on unitedstates military diplomatic and intelligence matters my amendment gives the executive authority to avoid spies having the run of the country my amendment is a recognition of the fact that in addition to the state departments legitimate political and diplomatic interests diplomatic travel affects the fbi and dods internal security responsibilities these agencies concerns deserve to be recognized and acted upon diplomatic travel involves many competing interests in the executive branch therefore there should be a balance of power within the executive to deal with the issue not a single department with unilateral and final authority over the subject otherwise the state department will continue to ignore the congressional intent and mandate of the foreign missions act my amendment should not be misinterpreted as a dod and fbi veto over travel requests because both must consult with the secretary of state and the director of central intelligence before using their authority in the amendment to deny an individual diplomats travel neither the fbi or dod woi d use their authority lightly one can hardly claim that the fbi has a flistory of ignoring or overriding state department concerns as for the fbi they are a far smaller and less powerful agency than state and traditionally have accommodated and deferred to the state department except in extreme cases meanwhile the defense department has its own concerns about reciprocity such as ensuring that unitedstates defense attaches stationed abroad have a maximum of free movement besides no executive branch agency is free to disregard totally the points of view and desires of another because the head of the department always has the recourse to go to the president to seek resolution of the interagency dispute in the case of foreign policy or national security related questions a mechanism clearly rests within the process of the national security council the current arrangement whereby the fbi and dod having no vested or institutional arrangement to object to individual instances of travel does not serve unitedstates national security interests in addition by offering this amendment i am allowing the fbi and dod to specifically target those types of travel which directly threaten unitedstates national security while at the same time respecting the state departments interests in allowing the nonthreatening types of travel to proceed unimpeded that ability does not exist now the present law orly creates arrangements for broad travel controls rather than finely tuned restrictions as it stands now travel controls must apply to intelligence personnel as well as nonintelligence personnel within a given mission such an acrosstheboard generic approach deprives the fbi the defense department and the state department the ability to respond to hostile intelligence activities on an individual basis my amendment offers a more sophisticated rifle approach to the problem instead of the present shotgun approach and thereby protects both diplomatic and counterintelligence interests if congress fails to enact legislation of this kind in the future it will be saying to the fbi and dod that they do not deserve an institutional means of objecting to hostile intelligence activity and also tell the state department that the congressional intent of the foreign missions act no longer matters to underline the significance of this issue i am including in the record a backgrounder written by two brilliant heritage foundation analysts tom dewey and ambassador charles

legislation will add an important though missing component to existing groundwater protection programs and to the pending array of ground water research and information bills before congress my bill is designed to minimize the impact of agricultural nitrogen and fertilizers on ground water and surface water quality by establishing a nationwide educational program aimed at the american farmer through increased education public information and the adoption of agricultural best management practices this nation can prevent many of its ground water and surface water quality problems right from the start the american farmer the fertilizer industry the scientists the appropriate federal state and local officialsall of those groups will play a key role my bill brings each of these players together to get the ball rolling and to emphasize the role of agricultural nitrogen in ground and surface water quality protection the need for this legislation is well documented today agricultural activities are known to be one of the heaviest contributors to nonpoint source pollution of both ground water and surface water we have come to realize that the overapplication of fertilizer can in certain instances contaminate ground water and lead to serious health problems farmers and other rural residents are the population at most risk since they often depend on the private untreated well water located below the farmed land minnesotans are particularly aware of this dilemma since ground water serves as a potable water supply for threefourths of the population we are faced with difficult policy questions in light of the environmental and public health concerns how should we alter widely accepted farming practices without losing farreaching benefits of crop nutrition the answer is to provide increased research technical information and sitespecific best management practices proposals such as h r 791 the unitedstates geological survey research bill and h r 2253 the environmental protection agency research and development bill are helpful but do not fill all the gaps or meet all the information needs as a farmer i know we need to develop more information spread the wealth of knowledge and implement agricultural best management practices on a greater scale these efforts however will undoubtedly require close coordination among federal state and local authorities and an some cases farmers may need to make fundamental changes to their normal agricultural practices i believe my bill will help get us started in the right direction at the right pace section 1 of the bill states the act may be cited as the agricultural nitrogen management act of 1987 section 2 contains various authorities and provisions related to the department of agriculture and establishes an agricultural nitrogen best management task force subsection a states that the purpose of the section is to authorize the department of agriculture to develop educational programs on agricultural best management practices to minimize nitrogen losses from all potential agricultural sources and practices subsection b contains various findings including the finding that careful selection of agricultural best management practices will help farmers reduce the effect of agricultural practices on ground and surface water quality through judicious use of plant nutrients subsection c which is the heart of the bill directs the secretary of agriculture to establish an agricultural nitrogen best management practices task force consisting of eight specified members together these representatives of the department of agriculture the epa the tennessee valley authority and the american farmer should be able to coordinate a comprehensive approach to fertilizers and nitrogen management subsection d provides that the functions of the task force are first to develop agricultural best management practices for agricultural nitrogen utilization in crop production second to develop educational and training material and third to disseminate educational materials to farmers subsection e requires the task force to give a progress report to congress within 2 years of enactment and describes specific contents of the report subsection f defines the term agricultural nitrogen and the term agricultural best management practices for purposes of the act subsection g authorizes such sums as may be necessary for each of the first 5 fiscal years after date of enactment section 3 provides two amendments to section 319 of the clean water act which establishes a new nonpoint source management program within the environmental protection agency subsection a amends the clean water act to require that any state assessment report and any state management program be developed in consultation with the agricultural nitrogen best management practices task force established by section 2 of this bill similarly subsection b amends the act to require the administration of epa to consult with the task force in preparing the administrators annual and final reports to congress these amendments will highlight the important link between nonpoint source pollution and agricultural best management practices section 3 will also encourage greater consultation with and coordination among federal state and local agencies since the recent enactment of the water quality act of 1987 we are already beginning to see greater cooperation and consistency between the states and epa my own state of minnesota is setting a fine example in this area just recently the state enacted the minnesota clean water partnership act to meet its nonpoint source pollution needs develop best management practices and satisfy other requirements under the clean water act the new minnesota law will help to identify the combination of education incentives and best management practices to tackle ground water and surface water problems across the state my bill is intended to build upon these efforts emphasizing the connection between agricultural and nonpoint source pollution strategies and strengthening the ties among federal state and local agencies and the american farmer based on my experiences as a farmer and on testimony received by the public works and transportation committee the agriculture committee and others i see a tremendous need for this bill we must place greater emphasis on nitrogen management agricultural practices and their overall impact on water quality my bill takes an important first step to address this need and provides a good springboard for further legislation i hope in the coming weeks members of the agriculture and public works committees will take a close look at my legislation as we consider comprehensive ground water

members of the laborhhseducation subcommittee for having so successfully defended the priorities of this house in the vital policy and programmatic areas encompassed by this bill moreover i believe they should be further congratulated for having achieved this success within the rigorous parameters set forth by both the 1987 economic summit and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolutions tight 302 b allocations some months ago i was given the oppolunity to appear before the appropriations subcommittee to discuss the programmatic and funding issues which have concerned my committee this year we had more than the usual number of these since this was a year which has seen my committee reauthorize some of the major legislation under our jurisdiction and in so doing both strengthen existing programs and launch new initiatives in particular since this past spring my committee concluded an indepth revision of our elementary and secondary education programspublic law 100297 the hawkinsstafford elementary and secondary school improvement amendments of 19881 was most eager to persuade the subcommittee to provide appropriate levels of funding for both the familiar and the new programs in our legislation septemtber 9 1 988 i117340 the appropriations committee and this body did indeed once again express their steadfast commitment to the funding of elemontary and secondary education programs and as one who has always viewed eseas chapter 1 as the flagship of federal support to our nations schools i was especially pleased to learn how well the conference report supports chapter ls various programmatic components not only are chaptor ls basic grants andfor the first time since 1981its concentration grants well provided for but it is clear that our conferees fought to preserve funding for one chapter 1 initiative even start and agreed to the funding of another new component the rural educational opportunities program developed by our distinguished colleague bill goodling even start seeks to encourage schools to offer programs that will have the dual effect of helping parents who have not completed their high school education gain literacy skills and simultaneously become active partners in their childrens educational development aware along with many other members of the special problems faced by small rural schools i was delighted to find that the conference report provides almost 4 million to get the rural educational opportunities program underway under this program at least 10 regional rural assistance centers will be established to provide technical assistance to rural schools with chapter 1 children in attendance with the view of improving the quality of the education such children receive i also want to particularly commend and thank our conferees for preserving the greater part of the modest 2year funding they and the house had eadler provided to launch the national commission on responsibilities for financing postsecondary education when my committee was preparing to reexamine and reauthorize the higher education act heal it occurred to me that if at one time each of the usual participants in financing postsecondary educationstudents parents colleges the states and the federal governmenthad held a reasonably clear grasp of their respective financial responsibilities this was no longer the case today students have greatly increased loan debt burdens at graduation some parents refuse to help their children finance their education a few states have increased higher education appropriations while others have cut them congress and the executive branch are debating the appropriate magnitude of federal student assistance in light of our deficit burden with these factors in mind i successfully sponsored an amendment to hea now section 1321 of the act which would establish a national commission of highly respected individuals their tasks would be to study the impact of the changing roles of the various participants in the financing of postsecondary education and within 2 years provide useful guidance on who should be expected to pay what share of a students education i am sure that the modest cost of this commission will be repaid back to the taxpayer as it moves forward to create a new national consensus over who benefits from a college education and who should pay in the course of reauthorizing and amending the child abuse prevention and treatment and adoption reform act of 1976 this year my committee contributed to the development of two new adoption opportunities program initiatives the minority children placement program and the postlegal adoption services progran im pleased that the conference has seen fit to launch these programs by providing each of them with 500 000 even these modest levels of funding make good humanitarian and fiscal senseit is far more expensive to maintain tnese children in temporary foster care or in longterm institutional settings than to place them in homes where they are desired and loved the conference report also makes it clear that thanks primarily to the levels of support our appropriations committoe recommended and the house endorsed as well as to the agreements reached by our conferees four key postsecondary education programs have been provided with funding levels above their fiscal year 1989 baselines the group of special programs for the disadvantaged known as trio the supplemental educational opportunity grants the pell grants and the income contingent loan program i was also especially pleased to find tmat in the area of our special education concerns the early intervention components of our education for the handicapped act programs as well as the rehabilitation act programs received funding above their respective fiscal year 1989 baseline levels one of the funding issues which concerned my committee earlier this year was that our budget resolutions assumptions were not responsive to the needs of the older americans act oaa programs i expressed these concerns to our appropriations committee noting that if the funding of supportive services to seniors and of the senior congregate and homedelivered meal programs were frozen at fiscal year 1988 levels we could expect to see these programs cut back in the number of services and meals provided or in the quality of what was provided or both i was very pleased consequently to find that the conference report provides these three oaa title iii programs with funding levels that will at least partially cushion the erosion of inflation on

system of maryland the firefighters and police of baltimore and harford counties the state police and the hospital staffs of franklin square greater baltimore fallston johns hopkins university and francis scott key among others the salvation army and the american red cross were there by the scores for some 48 hours the thousands of persons making up these groups and the residents gave their all to save lives and help people nothing else crossed their minds as they struggled in the cold tohelp each other and to take their turns to try to lift people out of perilously dangling rail passenger cars never thinking of themselves only what could they do to help it was such a superior united effort that i believe the record of cooperation shall go unbeaten because every segment of the community pitched in with only one thought in mindwho needs help and what can i do to help in every tragic accident we hear stories of heroism some are obvious others are not in these tough times when we hear so many negative stories circulated about our young people it was a joy to be told that some of the real unsung heroes of the amtrak colonial disaster were youngers living in twin rivers and harewood park robert booker 20 and his cousin michael 19 heard the explosion as the two trains hit and each went off running on his owncoincidentally one to each end of the train to pull people out of windows of burning cars as they were performing this brave feat they accidentally bumped into each other and then began working as a team in tandem never thinking about the dangers to themselves as the flames were engulfing the cars and making it very difficult to get in it has been estimated that the two together helped rescue some 70 persons working with mike and robert were two young women who have been undergoing paramedic training angle tart 17 who had finished her course saw the train hit and ran to the home for her best friend tracy burton 18 to ask her to help the two young women gave intermediate care to those pulled out by the young men angie even stayed with one of the more seriously injured for more than 8 hours others like tommy landers 17 helped by running food and drinks and blankets to the scene of the injured these five youngsters were not alone in their efforts some residents had as many as 10 to 30 passengers in their homes for several hours sunday what they did was typical of the community of chase nothing was too much to ask for and when the passengers had all been transferred to mobilization centers the residents made their homes available to the members of the national media and to the rescue teams as they were needed nothing was too much to ask for the magnitude of the tragedy was further contained by the superb coordination and efforts of the

accidentmany who werent even on standby duty and what would we do in maryland without our volunteer fire depart ments as those from baltimore county left their firehouses to help relieve at the scene firemen from harford and carroll countiesr among others backed them by filling in at the firehouses we also must mention that the business community supplied the vast amounts of food and coffee gratis we were told about mcdonalds taco bell mars kentucky fried chicken pizza john wendys and chase deli although there may have been others these food establishments kept sending replenishments at frequent intervals to make certain that those working on the scene would be well sus tained while undergoing the grisly task of digging through the rubble and cutting away steel to save lives in town at the red cross headquarters on charles street the line of blood donors stretched around the block early on monday morning and in area hospitals people are walking in off the street volunteering to give blood for the accident this outpouring of concern and help both of the skilled and unskilled makes me so proud of our state and its people the medical system which performed so wonderfully has been highly trained by emergency drills each one of the hospitals has two drills a year and the state medical system ran a statewide drill in con junction with the army last fall it all paid off this past weekend we will never know how many lives were saved because of the drills and training by the hospitals fire departments and police nor can we judge the volunteer hours involved in getting the many services to the site of the collision where they were so needed and so utilized but it is in the long tradition of america neighbors helping neighbors and it is a moving thing to see we all hate these awful accidents working on a newspaper over the years ive seen all too many and each has its own horrorit never fades but for whatever comfort there is to be had in the thought before the medical emergency system was put together it would have been a lot worse for many people if the rescue efforts had not been so well directed and coordinated the tragedy would have been much greater and finally and most importantly had the people in the town of chase not cared so much and been so kind to all the train passengers and volunteers there would have been nothing to remember but the

special order on children in america together helen keller once said it is not possible for civilization to flow backwards while there is youth in the world the challenge before us is that of providing all our children the opportunity to become productive citizens the relationship between the family home and the workplace has a profound effect on the lives of our children in 1955 60 percent of the households in the united states consisted of a working father a housewife mother and two or more schoolage children in 1980 that family unit was only 11 percent and in 1985 it was 7 percent an astonishing change more than 50 percent of women are in the work force with the percentage increasing according to the census 59 percent of the children born in this country in 1983 will live with only one parent before reaching the age of 18 the united states has the highest adolescent birth rate of any idustrialized nation each year half a million children are born to children under the age of 17 in fact every day 40 teenage girls give birth to their third child being the third child of a child certainly puts ones future very much at risk as we are well aware the statistics about children and poverty are staggering one child in four is born into poverty singleparent femaleheaded households living in poverty in this country have increased dramatically from 2 4 to 3 4 million between 1975 and 1985 nearly 40 percent of all such households live in poverty in 1986 of households with children under 6 years old 2 8 million were headed by women and 1 7 million of these families were poor being supportive of a childs development under these circumstances is difficult at best to permit large numbers of citizens to grow up uneducated illhoused and underfed not only limits future productivity but undermines the integrity of our strength as a nation public policy debates regarding the welfare and future of our children cannot ignore the interrelationship of the family structure our system of education and training and the workplace environment the education and training individuals receive influence and often determine the type of job they can hold their jobs in turn contribute heavily to the standard of living enjoyed by their families public policy changes made to revamp or retool the workplace will also have a major impact on the home the stakes in this debate are particularly high for children one program that has been part of the public policy debate in this area over the past 20 years is the work incentive program it was established in 1967 with the purpose of providing skill assessments job training and employment placement to help afdc recipients become selfsupporting unfortunately the program has not achieved its potential it has however managed to weather criticism and serious efforts to eliminate its funding recently though new support has surfaced for the win program this support is due to the great strides made in recent years under the win demonstration program authority as part of the provisions of the 1981 omnibus budget reconciliation act states could for the first time as part of their regular programs require afdc recipients to work in public or nonprofit agencies in return for their welfare benefits in addition greater flexibility was given to the win program to fund onthejob training programs by diverting recipients welfare grants into wage subsidies for private employers the intent of these innovative programs has been to provide the means by which welfare recipients can be moved into gainful employment with the flexibility permitted under win demonstration programs states have begun to offer a mix of services ranging from basic skills education to sophisticated training as well as more traditional community work experience and what is now known as workfare in which clients undertake public service for a period of time in exchange for their grants the most discussed of these programs is the massachusetts etchoices program which has placed more than 30 000 welfare recipients and applicants in unsubsidized jobs the program is expected to save massachusetts taxpayers 107 million in reduced welfare benefits and increased tax revenues this year since its inception the et program has helped to reduce the welfare caseload by 4 percent my own state of vermont has initiated a similar program called up reach which is designed to consolidate at the state level many existing employment and training programs including win registration for the program is required of all afdc recipients who do not have federally defined exemptions it is voluntary for all other recipients training education career planning support services and job seeking opportunities are provided to program participants there is close interaction with potential employers so that meaningful jobs are available for program participants upon completion it is reasonable to expect that ablebodied individuals seek employment and that federal policy should encourage individuals to choose a life of selfsufficiency for many inadequate education and lack of training and work experience constitute major barriers to obtaining productive employment the opportunity to obtain education training and work experiences under win should be strengthened we also cannot ignore the issue of child careits availability affordability and quality unless we address in a comprehensive manner the education training and support needs of this significant segment of our population the longterm results could jeopardize our productivity competitiveness and standing as a world leader not only do we lose the contribution of the adults already dependent on government subsidy but we increase the chances that

us today makes several changes in programs under the jurisdiction of the committee on agriculture the food assistance for the homeless title of h r 558 was reported by the committee on agriculture as h r 177 the goal of that legislation is to help meet the food needs of homeless people an issue the committee has looked at in depth i support these and other programs aimed at providing food assistance to needy individuals and families in fact these are but two of the several programs operated in the unitedstates department of agriculture to provide food assistance the usda programs alone account for over 20 billion in 1987 spending the committee bill does not increase expenditures in 1987 that was one of the goals of this legislation and i commend the subcommittee chairman for achieving that target however there are significant costs to the budget in 1988 and the outyears with insufficient offsets to accommodate these spending increases the committee was informed that the 1988 budget resolution will accommodate this additional spending at this point the 100th congress has not adopted the 1988 budget resolution and yet we are proposing to spend money we do not know if we will have for example the shelter deduction ceiling might be as low as 162 if the most recent weight given fuels and other utilities were used throughout the period under consideration included in the food assistance title are several changes to the food stamp program and reauthorization and improvement of the temporary emergency food assistance program this title first allows states to conduct outreach activities aimed at persons without permanent homes to encourage them to participate in the food stamp program the federal government will pay onehalf of all outreach costs second increases the shelter deduction for food stamp participants with high shelter costs from 149 per month to 168 per month effective third exempts housing assistance payments made on behalf of households living in temporary quarters from consideration as income for food stamp purposes such payments will not be counted if the temporary housing lacks facilities for preparation and cooking of hot meals or refrigeration fourth coordinates the annual adjustment of food stamp income levels with annual adjustments of food stamp benefit levels and deductions all will take place on october 1 fifth denies the earned income deduction to food stamp participants who deliberately fail to report earnings sixth allows the secretary upon certification of need by a state governor to provide up to 14 million pounds of surplus cheese for distribution within the state governors must certify that there are eligible participants not being served by tefap or that the unemployment rate within the state has risen and that the distribution of surplus cheese will not substantially displace the commercial sales of cheese seventh reauthorizes tefap through 1990 at the following levels 1988 52 million 1989 53 9 million 1990 56 2 million according to the congressional budget office there is no cost to the budget in 1987 as a result of the food assistance for the homeless provisions however in 1988 the cbo estimates the cost will be 111 millionthe total cost through 1990 is 387 million the cost of these provisions in 1988 and the outyears remains a concern to me as i stated during the subcommittee and committee consideration the congress has not yet adopted a 1988 budget resolution and i believe we must be budget conscious we must be assured that we can pay for future increases in the budget as we make these changes not only for aid to the homeless but for all expenditures of taxpayer dollars h r 558 of which the food assistance to the homeless title is just one part presents even greater budget problems cbo estimates the cost to be 500 million in 1987 with no offsets to pay for these additional expenditures at least in the agriculture committee we did exercise fiscal responsibility for 1987 and show no additional expenditures to the budget however for 1988 and the outyears we too have problems i am concerned about the homeless individuals and families however as we did in house joint resolution 102 we must be able to pay for the benefits we provide of the many issues before the 100th congress this is one which i find to be difficult to resolve as i have said before during the several hearings the subcommittee has held concerning this issue of food assistance to the needy i firmly believe that in our nation of abundance it is a tragedy for one child or one elderly person or anyone to go hungry we are a generous countryboth through government programs and through the private sector usda programs alone provide over 20 billion in food assistance private sector contributions to various nonprofit organizations regularly increase from year to year and approached 80 billion last year and yet there is no dispute that there are significant numbers of homeless people in both urban and rural areas of the united states the causes of homelessness are many and are complex they include the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients redevelopment of cities and the loss of lowrent housing highunemployment rates and a breakdown in traditional family structure the federal state and local programs available to low income individual and families often do not meet the needs of the homeless despite the bilions spent each year while housing is the key issue in dealing with homelessness other services are needed as well these include food assistance health and mental health clinics and for those who are able assistance in getting and keepng jobs the two major programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee that provide food assistance are the food stamp program and the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap neither of which are designed for the homeless but both provide assistance to this group of individuals through the food stamp program participants are provided food coupons which in most cases supplement the food budget of low income people however for the homeless difficulties arise in making full use of food coupons since they lack homes and cooking and food storage facilities last year the congress amended the food stamp act to allow the homeless to use food coupons in shelters and soup kitchens this provision was patterned after a proposal that i was working on along with chairman panetta concerning demonstration projects designed to allow the homeless to purchase low cost nutritious meals at soup kitchens while the amendment adopted last year does not address all concerns we covered in our proposal i am anxious to see how this further extension of the food stamp program to the homeless will work the pilot project we proposed presented a unique opportunity to begin solving a difficult problem in a straightforward manner lacking facilities for storage and preparation of food homeless individuals are unable to make optimal use of food stamp benefits to which they may be entitled by permitting such eligible individuals to use food stamps to purchase lowcost prepared meals the proposal would increase the effectiveness of the program for some of its most needy beneficiaries those operating the soup kitchens could have used food stamps for the purchase of food in large quantities thereby maximizing the efficiency of food stamp benefits for the homeless in addition the use of food stamps would have been limited to the purchase of food rather than preparation services and other associated costs also maximizing food stamp program funds by alleviating hunger and adhere to the goal of the food stamp act the second program under our committees jurisdiction is the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap provides surplus commodities to states for distribution to organizations serving lowincome people some of whom are homeless in 1988 it is anticipated that the commodities made available will include 420 million pounds of cheese 180 million pounds of rice 144 million pounds of flour 96 million pounds of honey 96 million pounds of nonfat dry milk 72 million pounds of butter and 48 million pounds of cornmeal with regard to tefap i am pleased that the congress acted to overturn the proposed deferral of 28 6 million of tefap administrative funds i introduced house joint resolution 124 which disapproved that deferral so that the full amount of money states had planned to use to distribute surplus foods will be available during this year the agriculture committee may be able to contribute to easing the problems of the homeless but solving this problem will require much more and must involve not only the federal government but state and local governments and our communities as well i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5072689056396484, 0.5072689056396484, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me and i rise in support of

impact on our churches schools with a religious affiliation farmers and small business owners to name but a few last week i asked the justice department to respond to some of these concerns and today i would like to share ihese answers i received a letter monday from mr mark r disler deputy assistant attorney general at the unitedstates department of justices civil rights division pursuant to your request i am enclosing some information that expresses our concerns about s 557 the civil rights restoration act of 1987 in our view the bill is far more than a simple restoration of the scope of the statutes it amends specifically i am enclosing for your review a list of just some of the flaws in s 557 together with more detailed explanations of some of those concerns march 24 1988 included with the letter from the justice department was a 2page listing of flaws in the legislation we passed 2 weeks ago some of these are alarming let me share them with you the civil rights restoration act represents a vast expansion of federal power over state and local governments and the private sector including churches and synagogues farmers businesses voluntary associations and private and religious schools the expansion goes well beyond the scope of power exercised by the federal government before grove city without being exhaustive some examples are an entire church or synagogue will be covered under at least three of these statutes if it operates one federally assisted program or activity every school in a religious school system will be covered in its entirety if one school within the school system receives even 1 of federal financial assistance grocery stores and supermarkets participating in the food stamp program will be subject to coverage solely by virtue of their participation in that program farmers receiving crop subsidies price supports or similar federal support will be subject to coverage every division plant facility store and subsidiary of a corporation or other private organization principally engaged in the business of providing education health care housing social services or parks or recreation will be covered in their entirety whenever one portion of one division plant facility store or subsidiary receives any federal aid thus if one program at one nursing home or hospital in a chain receives federal aid not only is the entire nursing home or hospital covered but all other nursing homes or hospitals in the chain are automatically covered in their entirety even if they dont receive federal aid further if the tenant of one unit in one apartment building owned by an entity principally engaged in providing housing receives federal housing aid not only is the entire apartment building covered but all other apartment buildings all other housing operations all other nonhousing businesses of the owner are covered even though they receive no direct or even indirect federal aid the entire plant or separate facility osf all other corporations and private organizations not principally engaged in onp of the five specified activities would be covered if one portion of or one program at the plant or facility receives any federal aid this includes all other plants or facilities in the same locality as the facility which receives federal aid for one of its orograms a private national social service organization will be covered in its entirety together with all of its local chapters councils or lodges if one local chapter council or lodge receives any federal financial assistance a state county or local government department or agency will be covered in its entirety whenever one of its programs receives federal aid thus if a state health clinic is built with federal funds in san diego ca not only is the clinic covered but all activities of the states health department in all parts of the state are also covered all of the commercial noneducational activities or a school college or university including rental of commercial office space and housing to those other than students or faculty as well as investment and endowment policies will be covered if the institution receives even 1 of federal education assistance a vague catchall provision creates additional coverage as a consequence more sectors of american society will be burdened with increased federal paps work requirements the need to consult with certain advocacy groups and to maintain a record of such consultations for a period of years random onsite compliance reviews by federal agencies even in the absence of an allegation of discrimination thousands of words of federal regulations costly section 504 accessibility regulations that can require structural and equipment modifications job restructuring modifications of work

there will be increased exposure to the judgments of federal courts but what does all this mean to the average farmer or grocery store owner or university president or rabbi priest minister well grocery stores for example will be covered under this bill for the first timedespite the fact thdt in most instances their only contact with itederal assistance is the acceptance o food stampsand even though not one work of testimony in 4 years of debate on grove city has suggested that there is any problem with grocery stores in fact the national grocers association just one of many national

house that their members profit margin is about 1 penny on the dollar its not difficult to understand what will happen to that profit margin should grocers be subject to the federal paperwork

1988 my colleagues will recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that they can continue to handle a majority of these fair housing complaints complainants and respondents in fair housing discrimination cases are guaranteed due process rights in administrative proceedings and the fundamental right to a trial by jury in a unitedstates district court in instances where they so elect either the adjudication or the trial that results from the election is intended to be a final decision concerning the claims raised by the aggrieved person or any intervenor the aggrieved person or any intervenor may not relitigate the same claims raised in the complaint or seek additional or alternative relief through a direct action in federal court as was reflected in the colloquy between the gentleman from california and myself during consideration of this legislation in june res judicata applies and the intent is that claims based upon the same set of facts should be consolidated into one case before concluding i want to take this one last opportunity to mention some of the individuals who over the years have made positive and prominent contributions to this effort i have already noted and want to reinforce the tremendous contribution made by the gentleman from california the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner deserves special recognition our thanks go to the secretary of housing and urban development sam pierce for his pivotal role in this entire effort through his 8 years in office as the hud secretary

addition i also want to give muchdeserved credit to our former colleague and friend from the other body the distinguished senator from maryland charles mcc mathias for many years mac was the principal sponsor of this legislation in the senate and was always ready and willing to lend his time and his advice to this effort pivotal players over the years have been ralph neas the executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights as well as my good friend althea simmons executive director washington office of the naacp kerry scanlon of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights under law wade henderson of the aclu and penda hair of the naacp legal defense fund also brought their usual fairness and balance to this effort the compromise that brought about prompt approval of this legislation in the house of representatives just a few weeks ago could never have occurred without the assistance of these and other representatives of the civil rights community their willingness to compromise was the key this is also an appropriate time to give recognition to many of the unsung heroes which you may not read about in the newspapers but nevertheless have made major

the san pedro riparian national conservation area in cochise county az the state of arizona is home to a wide range of environmental treasures from the grand canyon and the rich forests in the north and east to the red rocks of sedona and the beautiful central and southern deserts the san pedro in the south is yet another of arizonas many treasures the 30milelong corridor along the san pedro which is affected by this particular measure is a unique riparian habitat with over 260 species of birds 120 archaeological and historical sites and 9 vertebrate fossil sites we are fortunate to be able to take the steps today to preserve it and in fact we ought to seize the opportunity to act especially when we can minimize adverse impacts on other uses this legislation was brought about as a result of much hard work and cooperation among the members of the arizona delegation the committee and interested parties in the state the delegation worked especially hard to reach an acceptable compromise on grazing the bill does not speak to the issue of water rights and that concerned me at first silence on this issue means that the courts might infer a federal reserve water right for the conservation area i would have preferred that congress speak to the issue up front however after a thorough investigation it does not appear that anyones rights will be jeopardized by any reserved right that might be created as a result of this particular bill and in any event any such right must be established in the ongoing gila river adjudication where we are informed a claim has been made there are several other issues which deserve attention the bill restricts motorized vehicles to designated roads and that is as it should be however the secretary of the interior remains free to designate which roadways can be used by motorized traffic we believe he should and will ensure that adequate roadways are designated to guarantee public access to the conservation area as a cosponsor of h r 568 i can assure my colleagues that it is our intention that the area should remain accessible similarly the st david irrigation district requires access to the area to continue to maintain its damslte and receive water from the san pedro under rights established back in the 1800s the blm has indicated no objection to st davids access for that purpose therefore it is also our intention that st david have that ability to maintain its damsite this bill protects a valuable natural resource for arizonans and all americans while at the same time protecting the needs of those with existing

these reasons it is difficult to know whether this is a legitimate security threat and response to that threat or a political ploy to push for additional military aid to the contras the only hope for resolving the conflict in central america remains the effort of the five nations led by president arias to find a negotiated settlement in the middle of this effort for peace it is wrong for the

very well turn out to be the biggest spending congress of all time we have had three major bills before us so far this year and every single one of them has provided for major spending increases furthermore they all have come up under procedures that prevent costcutting amendments from being offered at some point in time we have to call a halt to these spending proclivities unless of course a tax increase is what the democrats have in mind to pay for them i note in the latest abc poll that 72 percent of all americans oppose any tax increase so any move in that direction would obviously be

offset it with reductions elsewhere the president submitted 5 8 billion worth of rescissions on which this house has yet to act less than 1 percent of those recissions would offset the spending

from the federal government we are the ones running the big deficit the states on the other hand are trying to figure out how to dispose of the revenue windfall accruing to them under the tax reform

developed the rockefeller wheat varities for example that doubled and tripled the grain production in areas for india in areas where their people were starving expertise in irrigation dam construction was utilized to move india from being one of the importers of wheat in the world in fact they bought american wheat and satisfied our production to being an exporter a net exporter of wheat and it is my understanding that india today is a net exporter because of american expertise because of scientific development of wheat that we gave to them because of the goodness in the hearts of americans because we wanted to help starving people with no strings attached no requirements for votes in the united nations no quid pro quo associated with it yet the soviet union which gives mig aircraft and attack helicopters and other weapons to india has apparently achieved a friendship with india that moves india to vote against the united states and for the soviet union india is advertised as being the worlds biggest democracy and i guess a lesson to the people of the united states is that a democracy is something other than simply a country in which a majority of the people work their will because if the majority of the people work their will against a minority and oppress them and kill them and persecute them then they are not a true democracy the oppression of the sikhs in india has demonstrated that india is not a democracy in the sense that it does not protect its minorities and that isthe hallmark of the united states and regrettably not the hallmark of india i would hope that

days have gone by jim had an energy an aura that preceded him into any room and remained present even after he left and i think that aura is still with us jim howard accomplished so much for this nation with that tremendous energy the backbone of this nation is its public infrastructure and i would defy anyone friend or foe to name one individual who has done more for our infrastructure than has jim howard who has done more to preserve and improve our highways and public transit systems than jim howard who has done more for our rivers and harbors who has done more to protect the nations supply of drinking water who more than jim howard has worked effectively to protect and enhance our aviation network and stock of public buildings and grounds i have sat with jim howard through over 19 years of hearings and jim knew that when we build a bridge were improving this nations economy and were putting americans to work to do it jim was a leader of our nations public works efforts since long before the fancy term infrastructure came along jim was a plainspoken man and didnt need fancy words to know that something was good and was right and once he became convinced that a cause was just there was no stopping him whether every member in this chamber agreed with jim howard on the 55 mileperhour speed limit issue certainly every one of us respected him deeply for his efforts you know jim howard had nothing to gain by his determined work on the speed limit i doubt if it gained him many votes there was never a powerful special interest backing him on this jim howard worked so hard on the issue simply because he felt he was right and because his efforts would not only make life better for many americans but would moreover preserve their lives as well after having worked with him for so many years i came to believe sometime before jims death that his approach to his job that we have this honor that is bestowed upon us by the communities which we represent was really a very simple one figure out whats right and then get it done thats a twostep process and jim was a master of both he could dig through all of the data and information that comes to use reach his hand through that sometimes murky pile and pluck out a pure gemstone the little nugget of truth and wisdom that is essential to good public policy and once he had that insight once he had his goal ive seen few who were better at making their vision become our vision so often the vision of good public policy in committee and on this floor was first seen through his eyes and the course that was steered in reaching that policy and having it enacted was often over a rough terrain but with him at the reins there was little doubt but that the destination would be reached jim of course has now reached his destination as must we all the legacy he leaves behind is evident in public works throughout this nation and the tremendous legacy that this may be it is not his greatest one jims greatest legacy is our memory of him his energy and his aura which still remain because they are his assurance that we must rededicate ourselves to the efforts and goals to which he was so committed without jim howard

in the middle east let me briefly address the house to state that it is sad to hear analyses as oversimplified and frankly as unhelpful as occasionally are presented to this chamber the fact is there is one essential obstacle to peace in the middle east and the obstacle to peace is the continued unwillingness of any of the representatives of the palestinian people to sit down and talk peace with the state of israel we are seeing a tragic situation in that region unfold as we approach an israeli election in november of 1988 the same month as our own elections we can hear and see an agonizing debate in israel about how to make peace with their arab neighbors while the israeli debate is focused upon the question of how to make peace unfortunately the arab nations and the palestinians have not yet come to the mountain on whether to make peace the essential question that is facing the peoples of the region where so much sadness and so much tragedy and so much bloodshed has unfolded over the years is whether or not there will be an arab spokesman other than the representatives of the state of egypt willing to sit down and live in peace with their neighbors in israel until that happens and until the plo ceases to rely upon terror and is willing to alter its convenant which still refers to the elimination of the state of israel and until the plo recognizes that peace requires the acceptance of the state of israel as a longterm secure and stable neighbor distractions such as the ones that we have heard which take our eyes off the ball are not helpful and are not constructive we

in the past have objected to measures that make acrosstheboard cuts for one reason or another they say if there are particular programs or countries that you object to why not go after them

reinstitute current law the state department could send military aid to mozambique i might add the state department a couple years ago in the foreign aid bill tried to get military assistance for this country a communist country we were able to defeat it and i think today we should restate our position that we do not want any military assistance going to a communist country but unless we reinstitute current law the state department could send military aid this amendment also continues the waiver provision in current law which states that we could send military assistance if the
