hundreds of innocent protesters were crushed to death hundreds more were mowed down by machine gun fire hundreds more were arrested and executed the men and women who gave their lives for freedom in tiananmen square in beijing and those who are still languishing in chinese prisons are in many ways the heirs to the legacy of our founding fathers in the days leading up to their slaughter they quoted jefferson not mao their source of inspiration was not maos little red book but our statue of liberty we all witnessed the lone mah blocking those oncoming tanks for that individual at that time freedom and democracy were ideals that were absolutely worth dying for tonight we stand here in remembrance of that man who stood in front of the tank and the countless other chinese people who chose thomas jefferson over mao tsetung we stand here in consolation with their bereaved mothers and fathers who still cannot find their daughters and sons whether they disappeared in tiananmen square or whether they disappeared in tibet but most of all we stand in defiance to those who would continue to sacrifice the freedom and democracy for the chinese people on the alter of free trade wei jingshang a democracy activist that spent nearly two decades in chinese prison for his political beliefs once tbld me that american corporate executives not chinese spies not mao tsetung not the thugs who run the slave labor camps but that american corporate executives are the vanguard of the chinese communist party revolution in the united states he is right there is no issue before congress that has lobbied more heavily than giving the peoples republic of china continued trading privileges and while virtually every nation other nation in the world retains washington lobbyists to do their bidding china relies on the business community to do its heavy lifting in this city every year when we debate most favored nation status for china every year when we debate this issue american ceos stream into ronald reagan airport seeking special favors for the worlds worst abuser of human rights they are helped by former government officials highranking american former government officials that know how the machinery of our government operates including former secretary of state henry kissinger former unitedstates trade representative carla hills and former unitedstates commerce secretary mickey cantor for those who do not agree with my assessment i recommend you contact the editors of fortune magazine who this fall are sponsoring a 3day business trip to shanghai this trip including dinner with president jiang zemin and a luncheon with henry kissinger will outline and thank these american business corporations these american corporate executives for their work in china after the conclusion of their gala in shanghai many of these corporate ceos plan the next day october 1 of this year to go to beijing and celebrate with communist party leadership the 50th anniversary of the founding of the peoples republic of china the 50th anniversary of the victory of communism in china just think about that american corporate leaders some of the wealthiest most successful most wellpaid corporate leaders in the united states will travel to beijing and stand and sit at tiananmen square with leaders of the communist party revolution celebrating 50 years of communist rule in china and celebrating frankly maybe implicitly but frankly celebrating the deaths of those hundreds and hundreds maybe thousands of demonstrators for democracy that were following thomas jefferson not mao tsetung but much of the equipment on display as they sit in beijing and watch this parade in tiananmen square that much of the equipment on display on october 1 of this year they know has been financed by chinas enormous bilateral trade surplus and incorporated stolen unitedstates technology apparently that is of little concern to americas most prosperous and wellpaid ceos after all these ceos and their wall street allies do not seem to care much if the shelves at the lorain ohio kmart are lined with goods manufactured by chinese prison labor their lawyers in washington do not care much if chinese workers are imprisoned for trying to form unions and these wellpaid ceos do not seem to care much that some of these companies that they contract with in china are paying chinese workers 12 cents an hour those that are being paid at all not to mention those that are in chinese slave labor camps and working for these american companies but it should bother all of us that after 10 years that 10 years after the slaughter at tiananmen square american citizens some of our wealthiest corporate leaders that benefit from living in a free and open society will be actively celebrating communism in china and at the same time actively celebrating the demise of democracy in china the harsh realities at the ongoing genocide in tibet the continued arrest and torture of democracy activists the proliferation of nuclear technology in north korea the forced abortions conducted by chinese communist leaders the persecution of christians and buddhists and all religions in china none of this seems much to matter to the leaders of our corporate community in this country to this i say the most effective way to toughen our relationship with china is to deny it special trading privileges every year many of us have prodded the republican leadership in this body to force china to improve its behavior before giving it preferential trade status china buys we buy from china approximately 75 billion worth of goods from that country every year china buys from us about 12 billion worth of goods we sell more to belgium with 1 120 of the population of china we sell more to belgium in a year than we sell to china we have a 65 billion trade deficit we sell 75 billion we buy 75 billion worth of goods from them they buy 12 billion worth of goods from us these trade benefits give chinese communist dictators the billions of dollars last year it was nearly 60 billion the billions of dollars and the commercial technology needed to modernize the peoples liberation army yet each year many of the same members of congress who are the loudest in their criticism of the clinton administrations china policy vote to give beijing preferential trade status mark my words after the vote on tuesday on mfn after this congress will again support the morally bankrupt position of the clinton administration and the republican leaders in congress many of those members on the other side of the aisle after voting to give preferential trade status to china will be yelling and screaming about the presidents wrong position admittedly but wrong position on his whole china policy yet when it comes time to step up to the plate tomorrow and vote on most favored nation status i hope they would come over and join those of us on both sides of the aisle that realize how corrupt this whole process is what we need to do before granting china special trade privileges is condition their behavior on something other than a whole series of broken promises i am weary of continued chinese communist promises that they will behave that they will play fair that they will stop the human rights abuses that they will stop the forced abortions that they will stop the child labor that they will stop the slave labor i would like to quote his mentor soviet leader lenin when he said promises are like pie crust they are made to be broken i asked the administration i asked the republican leadership in this body i asked the american business community so strongly supportive of mfn for china and so strongly supportive of world trade organization entry for china immediately i asked them to step back and let us see if china can behave for 1 year just only 1 year we should demand to see if china can stop its human rights abuses for only 1 year we should demand to see if china can stop using slave labor for only 1 year we should demand to see if china can stop child labor if only for 1 year and we should demand that china stop threatening taiwan before receiving another dollar from unitedstates consumers for only 1 year we must not give china special trading privileges until we see proof that its communist rulers are capable of abiding by the rule of law that is all we ask let us wait a year let us not give china most favored nation status let us not give china these trading privileges until they can prove to the american people and to their workers and to their citizens and their country that only for 1 year they can act like most of the rest of the world that is integrated into this world economy and the world trade organization and throughout the world economy just ask for 1 year if china could behave itself if china could join the league of nations to join the community of nations and act like the rest of us who treat workers decently who do not engage in human rights violations the way that china does i yield to my colleague the gentleman from ohio from the neighboring county cuyahoga county who has been an active participant and leader in this fight against most favored nation status for china"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "26 years ago on july 20 turkey invaded cyprus i will enter into the record at this time the statement on developments this year to resolve the human rights and political crises resulting from that illegal invasion in the almost 26 years of the division and occupation of cyprus many consider the next few months to be the best opportunity to bring about a cyprus solution many developments have brought us to this moment of caution and hope on december 3 1999 proximity talks on the cyprus problem were held for the first time in over two years during the week of december 314 1999 united nations secretary general kofi annan and u n special advisor on cyprus alvaro de soto had a series of separate meetings in new york city with cyprus president glafcos clerides and turkishcypriot leader rauf denktash both sides laid out their position on the four core issues identified by the secretary general security territory separation of powers and property the completion of this first round of proximity talks and the agreement of the two sides to keep talking was widely praised and raised hopes that the climate may be shifting towards a concerted effort for a comprehensive settlement a second round of talks took place in geneva switzerland from january 31st through february 8th 2000 during this round the two sides explored in greater depth the range of issues and prepared the ground for meaningful negotiations shortly thereafter during the period of february 28th through march 1st u n envoy alvaro de soto traveled to cyprus for a familiarization visit mr de soto had a full program of meetings on both sides of the divide in the southern governmentontrlled areas of the republic and in the northern part illegally occupied by turkey since its invasion in 1974 the visit also took de soto across the u n controlled buffer zone to observe peacekeeping operations i would like to say a few words about alvaro de soto a diplomat who i know well on behalf of the united nations mr de soto successfully facilitated negotiations between the two warring parties in el salvadors civil war these were not easy negotiations the differences and conflict between the two parties had a history going back decades and were of muchlonger standing than just 12 years of armed conflict tens of thousands of civilians had been murdered during the war and hundreds of others had disappeared i quickly learnedto respect and admire mr de sotos diplomatic skills his patience and his understanding and ability to distinguish between those issues which must not be compromised and those that might be more easily brokered between the two parties if a lasting peace were to be secured i was most impressed by his integrity and commitment to achieve a lasting peace one that would bring real peace to a longsuffering civilian population while i believe the cyprus conflict is in many ways more difficult and intractable than el salvadors i have greater hope that a solution may be negotiated because of alvaro de sotos involvement in identifying core issues and steps that might lead to a successful agreement earlier this month the parties met with alvaro de soto again in geneva to continue proximity talks those discussions adjourned on july 12th and will resume on july 24th they will proceed until early august and resume again in new york city at the united nations on september 12th we are all disappointed that turkish cypriot leader denktash interrupted the process and left the talks to return for the turkish cypriot celebration of the july 20th invasion of cyprus i remain hopeful however that continued international interest in and pressure for a negotiated settlement will result in a retum of good faith efforts by all parties to move the agenda forward when talks resume on july 24th the international community has been consistent throughout the past quarter century in expressing its support for a unified cyprus over the past several months it has been particulady forceful in expressing its support and desire for successful proximity talks leading to a comprehensive negotiated settlement these include strong statements from the european union leaders of the g8 nations the united nations security council the clinton administration and the unitedstates congress the people of cyprus have suffered too long a lasting and comprehensive solution one based on international law and democratic principles can and must be negotiated twentysix years ago on july 20th turkey invaded cyprus as a result an estimated 35 000 heavily armed turkish troops continue to occupy 37 percent of cyprus territory i hope that this year the beginning of the new millennium a new anniversary will be created it will be the year when the breakthrough happens and the people of cyprus are blessed with peace security reconciliation and a single democratic sovereignty"], [0.0, 1.0,

count the ways first of all china is a nation that practices slave labor and practices child labor why should we give trade advantages to a nation that engages in that kind of behavior with no oversight from us with no check on chinese behavior china is a nation that allows forced abortions a government that sometimes encourages forced abortions again a violation of any kind of behavior that we and most of the nations around the world find unacceptable the chinese government the chinese communist party is also a nation and a government that persecutes christians and muslims and buddhists and also local religious sects such as the falun gong in a china that again has no respect for human rights the government of china also has repeatedly sold nuclear technology to countries that have no business having that kind of nuclear technology that can very easily turn into weapons of mass destruction ej 1245 at the same time in the last few weeks we have seen the peoples republic of china threaten the republic of taiwan three or 4 years ago during the last taiwanese elections the chinese government the peoples republic of china the communist chinese government sent missiles shooting into the straits of taiwan to threaten that nation that was holding the first free elections ever in chinese history giving china most favored nation status giving china permanent trading privileges with the west simply makes no sense china is a market that has been closed to us we 10 years ago 11 years ago when president reagan and president bush now president clinton began this policy of engagement with china where we would trade freely back and forth with china in those days 11 years ago we had 100 million with an m 100 million trade deficit with the peoples republic of china today after 11 years of this policy we have a 70 billion with a b 70 billion trade deficit with the peoples republic of china why because of slave labor because of child labor because they have simply closed their markets to us last year we bought 85 billion worth of goods from the peoples republic of china they only let us sell 15 billion of goods into their market we sell more to belgium than we do to china we sell more to singapore than we do to china we sell more to taiwan than we do to china countries that have at most 150th the population of the peoples republic of china no issue in my 8 years in congress has been debated as heavily or lobbied most importantly lobbied as heavily by as many wealthy special interest groups as the annual mfn review for china and now permanent trade relations with china there are more corporate jets at national airport when the china vote comes up there are more ceos individually the ceos of the largest corporations in america walking the halls of congress stopping in every members office lobbying them about supporting permanent trade privileges for the peoples republic of china wei jingsheng a chinese dissident who spent time in chinese prison camps said that the vanguard of the chinese communist party in the united states is american ceos think about that ceos of the largest companies in this country are doing the dirty work doing the heavy lifting doing the lobbying for doing the support of the communist leaders in the peoples republic of china this body would never even consider would not even come close to supporting permanent trade relations with china would not even come close to supporting any kind of tariff reductions most favored nation status trading privileges for china if these ceos of americas largest corporations were not walking the halls and lobbying for the communist leaders in the peoples republic of china these same ceos say well the reason we need to knock down all barriers to china and ignore human rights violations ignore the forced abortions ignore the persecution of christians and muslims the reason that we in the united states should ignore the nuclear sales to rogue nations the reason we in the united states should ignore slave labor and child labor in china is because it will help the united states of america and they say it will mean 1 2 billion consumers for american

commend and thank the gentleman from guam for his strong leadership of the congressional asian pacific caucus which he has brought to the forefront and addressed many of the critical issues facing our nation unfortunately i will not be able to participate in the special order tomorrow as i have a prior commitment to give an asian pacific american heritage month speech at fort sill oklahoma and then at fort hood texas this coming weekend on that note i have just returned from fort bragg north carolina and fort sam houston texas where last week i delivered addresses to our service men and women at their asia pacific heritage month programs i certainly want to extend my deepest appreciation to major general william boykin of the unitedstates army special forces headquarters and brigadier general thomas turner of the unitedstates army 82nd airborne both groups at fort bragg north carolina and also my good friend major general james peake the commanding general at fort sam houston for their warm and gracious hospitality and the courtesies that were extended to me when i visited them earlier this month i am privileged to be here tonight to share with our great nation a l6gacy of those americans whose roots extend from the soils of hation in the asia and pacific region the asian pacific region is a dynamic areaof the world where twothirds of the worlds population reside our nations trade with the asian pacific region is almost twice of any other region including europe i recall senator daniel inouye of hawaii once elaborated or illustrated our trade with the asian pacific region and europe in this fashion he once made the comment that for every one or single 747 that flies between the atlantic and the east coast of our nation four 747s fly between the asian and pacific region to our country asians or americans of asian pacific descent over 10 5 million strong are among the fastest growing demographic groups in the united states today over the last decade the asian pacific american community has more than doubled and this rapid growth is expected to continue in the 21st century by 2050 the asian pacific american population is projected to exceed 40 million people as many of my colleagues are aware the immigrants of the asian pacific countries are amongst the newest wave to arrive in the united states in recent years however they are merely the latest chapter in a long history of asian pacific americans in our nation during this time of celebration it is only fitting that we honor our fellow citizens of asian pacific descent both from the past and the present that have blessed and enriched our nation i submit that asian pacific americans have certainly been an asset to our countrys development and it is most appropriate that our president and the congress recognize these achievements by establishing a national asian pacific heritage month the peoples of the asian pacific have contributed much to americas development for example in the fields of sciences and in medicine nothing exemplifies this more than time magazines selection a few years ago of a chinese american as its man of the year dr david ho head of the prestigious aaron diamond aids research center at new york university medical school dr hos journey starting as a 12yearold immigrant from taiwan to gracing the cover of time magazine has given hope to millions of people around the world afflicted by the hiv virus his story is a stirring testament to the significant contributions that asian pacific american immigrants have made to our nation as one of the foremost aids scientists in the world dr ho pioneered a treatment for the hiv infection with the usage of an antiviral drug this has fundamentally changed the approach of combatting aids stated time magazine in honoring dr ho dr hos work is greatly responsible for containing the aids epidemic in america and today less than 1 percent of our citizens are infected the rest of the world is not so fortunate just recently the clinton administration announced that global spread of aids has reached catastrophic dimensions that threaten to overwhelm foreign governments ignite wars and destabilize entire regions of the world with 16 million dead from aids and over 33 million infected worldwide the aids crisis has spread from africa to south asia to the former soviet union and even eastern europe the global aids pandemic is now so serious that the national security council of the united nations has declared it a national security threat even to our own nation against this backdrop dr hos medical research is inceasingly front and center stage in the worldwide battle to contain this destructive disease by restoring hope to millions of patients around the world suffering from this deadly virus dr ho is a credit to our nation and the asian pacific american community dr hos scientific advances continue a long record of service by other asian pacific americans for example in 1899 a japanese immigrant arrived on the shores of this nation after years of study and work this man dr hideyo noguchi isolated a syphilis germ leading to a cure for this deadly widespread disease for decades dr makio murayama conducted vital research in the united states that laid groundwork for combat in sicklecell anemia in 1973 dr leo esaki a japanese american was awarded the nobel prize in physics for his electron tunneling theories and in engineering few have matched the architectural masterpieces created by the genius of chinese american i m pey in the fields of business and commerce the names of prominent asian pacific american and corporate leaders and legal scholars are too numerous to mention one need only read our nations top periodicals and newspapers to document that asian pacific students both in secondary schools and universities are among the brightest minds that our nation has produced for example a recent stanford graduate jerry yang a taiwanese american who cofounded yahoo the internet directory yangs internet company recorded 588 million in sales last year and is valued at over 11 billion today just last week usa today announced its top 20 high school students around the nation and among the 20 top students that was announced by usa today 13 were asian pacific americans in the entertainment fields in sports amefican martial arts expert bruce lee captivated

brilliant performances over the years a native hawaiian by the name of duke kahanamoku shocked the world by winning the olympic gold medal for our nation in swimming 7 decades ago followed by dr sammy

the greatest olympic high diver ever known to the world a samoan greek american by the name of greg louganis whose record in gold medals and national championships and international tournaments will be in the books for a long long time to come there is japanese american kristi yamaguichi and chineseamerican michelle kwans enthralling ice skating performances at the winter olympics continued the milestone achievements by asian pacific americans in professional sports we have michael chang blazing new paths in tennis and pacific islanders brian williams and michael jones in world rugby and many others of course we cannot forget the tens of dozens of polynesian americans like samoan allpro linebacker junior seau of the san diego chargers and former allpro guard jesse sapolu of the san francisco fortyniners former allpro tackle dan saleaumua of the kansas city chiefs and allpro tackle luther ellis of the detroit lions who have made their mark as stars in the national football league

international boxing federation usa today just 2 days ago gave david tua as ranking number 3 overall in the world just ahead of evander holyfield and lewis lennox it is expected that david tua will be fighting for the heavyweight title sometime in november of this year one of the brightest stars to emerge recently from our community is yes none other than tiger woods a professional golfer who has identified himself not only as an africanamerican but as an asian american too due to his mother being of thai ancestry in routing the field in the masters tournament a few years ago tiger made history he continued making history this year by winning 6 pga golf tournaments in a row matching the second longest winning streak in history before tiger woods careeris finished this american will reinvent the game of golf i recall when someone asked tiger who he was or who he is in an article he said he is part africanamerican he is native american he is white he is asian american and that makes him a pure golfer another professional golfer we must honor is vijay singh originally from the island of fiji and is now an american resident this pacific islander showed great discipline and tremendous heart in winning this years masters tournament despite grueling weather conditions and competition from the worlds best golfers the win was vijays second major victory establishing his place certainly among golfs elite we also have asian americans who are making their mark in history not in our country but even in the far east we have samoan american salevaa atisanoe who only weighs 578 pounds as a former sumo wrestler in japan for 15 years a wrestler by the name of konishiki he was the first foreigner in japanese centuriesold sport to break through to the rarefied area of sumos secondhighest rank another samoan tongan american leitani peitani known in japan as musashimaru has now attained the last position in sumo wrestling known as yokozuna or grand champion along with him is a native hawaiian by the name of chad rowen or akebono as he is known in japan he has scaled even greater heights in sumo by attaining the exalted status of grand champion until this polynesian american arrived on the scene no foreigner had ever been permitted to assume this sacred position as the japanese associated the yokozuna with the essence of shintos guardian spirits the ascendancy to grand champion sumo status goes to the heart of the japanese religion and culture and it is a tremendous achievementby this native hawaiian and certainly a credit a tribute to the asian american community in honoring the asian american americans that have served to enrich our nation i would be remiss as a vietnam veteran if i do not honor the contributions of the japanese americans who served in the unitedstates armys 100th batallion and 442nd infantry combat group history speaks for itself in documenting that none have shed their blood more valiantly for america than the japanese americans who served in these units while fighting enemy forces in europe during world war ii the records of the 100th batallion and 442nd infantry are without equal these japanese american units suffered an unprecedented casualty rate of 314 percent and received over 18 000 individual decorations many awarded posthumously for bravery and courage in the field of battle a total of 52 distinguished service crosses 560 silver stars and 9 480 purple hearts were awarded to the japanese american soldiers who fought in the 100th batallion and 442nd infantry given the tremendous sacrifice of life however it was highly unusual that only one medal of honor was given nonetheless the 442nd combat group emerged as the most decorated group unit of its size ever in the history of the united states army president truman was so moved by their bravery in the field of battle as well as that of the africanamerican soldiers and sailors who fought during world war ii that president truman then issued an executive order to desegregate the armed forces i am proud to say that we can count senator daniel k inouye a highly respected senator and the late senator spark matsunaga of hawaii as soldiers who distinguished themselves in battle with the 100th batallion and 442nd infantry it was while fighting in italy that senator inouye then a young lieutenant was shot in the abdomen and leg and had his arm shattered by a grenade while advancing alone and personally eliminating three german machine gun nests that had pinned down his platoon the senator lost his arm and spent 20 months recovering in army hospitals before receiving the distinguished service cross the second highest medal for bravery awarded by our nation last week secretary of the army lewis caldera and the department of defense announced they have completed a reevaluation of the exceptional heroism displayed by the soldiers of the 100th batallion and 442nd infantry as a result i am very proud to say that next month on june 21 ion a special white house ceremony senator daniel inouye from hawaii and 18 of his fellow japanese american soldiers shall be awarded this nations last military decoration the medal of honor additionally two other soldiers a filipino american and a chinesehawaiian american shall also receive medals of honor at the white house ceremony for the past 12 years i have been complaining about this injustice where antijapanese and antiasian prejudice prevented these american heroes from being properly recognized on that point senator daniel k akaka of hawaii deserves tremendous credit and our nations gratitude for introducing legislation that passed in 1996 which mandated that the pentagon review and reevaluate the courageous exploits of the soldiers of the 100th battalion and 442nd infantry finally the records are being changed to reflect the legendary bravery of these asian american warriors and finally justice is being done it took 50 years and today there are only seven survivors out of the 21 medal of honor recipients but this is what makes america a great nation i submit i am pleased to see that this injustice has been corrected despite this change where we will now honor 21 asian pacific americans to become recipients of our nations highest award in the field of battle that of the medal of honor there are complaints from some socalled experts that the only reason why we made these changes is because of political pressures and that it is done because it was politically expedient i say to such criticism they are full of baloney what i would say is also the word awaha in the hawaiian language a bunch of hot air let me share with my colleagues and with theamerican people why the unitedstates army and the department of defense has properly upgraded these distinguished service cross recipients to the medal of honor for example staff sergeant rudolph davila of vista california in the armys breakthrough from a beachhead in anzaio italy in 1943 he singlehandedly saved 130 riflemen from german machine gun fire by silencing several gun positions private barney hajiro of waipahu hawaii charged uphill in eastern france in 1944 where he destroyed two german machine gun nests and killed two snipers a member of the 442nd infantry private mikio hasemoto hawaiiborn killed in action december 1 1943 in italy a member of the 100th batallion private joe hayashi of pasadena california killed in action he led attacks that took strategic hills near tendola italy a member of the 442nd private shizuya hayashi of pearl city hawaii charged with his automatic rifle near cerasuolo italy he killed nearly 20 germans and took four prisoners a member of the 100th batallion second lieutenant daniel inouye now a united states senator april 1945 he destroyed three german machine gun positions staying on the field to direct his troops after his right arm was shattered by an enemy grenade a member of the 442nd infantry tech sergeant yeiki

economically secure while much attention is given to the damage that unplanned growth can have to the physical environment the physical blight traffic congestion loss of open space wildlife habitat it is clear that a community that is not livable can also have direct impacts on the physical and psychological health of families as well just this week the south coast air quality management district in southern california released a report documenting the danger to people breathing the toxic air that is concentrated near southern californias congested freeways this danger has increased the risk of cancer people today are increasingly concerned about the soaring rates of asthma among our children which clearly appears related to the toxins we are putting into the air recently there was an article that i found amusing in the washington post about how some people really enjoy the real long commute it helps them center themselves and prepare for a long day i suppose that may be true for some but when the average american spends more than 50 work days a year trapped behind the wheel of a car just getting to and from their occupation and when we have lost 43 more hours in the last 5 years to commuting there are direct implications i would venture that for a much larger number the commute to work is not the highlight of their day the national sleep foundation has reported that the 158 hours added to the yearly work commutes since 1969 have been subtracted from the time many americans sleep carol rodriguez director of the institute of stress medicine in norwalk connecticut observed that people with lengthy commutes often exhibit signs of stress in the workplace marriage and family counselors in the bay area see patients struggling with the increased demands and stress placed upon them from their longer work commutes this struggle is manifesting itself in family problems and even divorce it has been noted that divorce itself is no longer a reliever to the stress of long commutes and separation because often after a family breaks up the difficulties of two households in coordinating the needs of children and employment are usually greater in terms of time and miles driven to hold things together the jobrelated problems where employers increasingly in congested communities never seem to know when their employees are going to show up seems tame by comparison one of the most interesting developments may be found in a report from the center for disease control and prevention on increasing obesity rates in the united states rates have been increasing since 1991 all across america but there was particular concern about an increase of over 101 percent in georgia in 1991 when the study began metropolitan atlanta had one of the lowest obesity rates what is the reason for the increase some blame the traditional southern diet which it is true is often high in fat but the souths diet is not that much different than the rest of the country today in any case it certainly does not explain why georgia has the worst problem than the rest of the south it is interesting that the researcher placed part of the blame on the problems that metropolitan atlanta is facing as the community has become less and less livable the skyrocketing obesity rates coincide exactly with the explosion of unplanned growth around metropolitan atlanta which some claim is the highes growth rate in history dr william deats one of the studys coauthors points out that the time in the car encourages not just more fast food it eats into the time for exercise others have noticed that atlantas unplanned growth has shortchanged the opportunities for outdoor exercise it is not a walkable community sidewalks do not lead anywhere and even if people had the time and a place to exercise the increasingly bad air makes the benefits of exercise problematic it is important for us to reflect on why the political landscape is being influenced by the discussion of livable communities and why it is such a major issue it seems at some level the american public understands that their health both emotional and physical of the family the ability to be fit reduce stress adequate sleep and for the family to live together is one of the first casualties if a community is not livable i strongly urge my colleagues to join with me in making sure that this session of

veterans administration budget in general is greatly underfunded we have a chance in this congress to fund adequately what veterans need we know what that figure is all the veterans organizations of this nation came together to recommend to us what they call the independent budget a budget that recommended 3 billion more than the baseline we have been dealing with the presidents budget that was submitted to this congress was inadequate it was 3 billion under what this recommendation was as it kept a straightline budget the budget as recommended by this committee does put in an additional 1 7 billion but that is only 50 percent of what all the veterans organizations say they need and i might point out that that 1 7 billion increase presupposes about a 3 billion decrease for veterans programs over the next 10 years so what we see here is the biggest cut in veterans funding over a long period of time now we have argued on this side of the aisle for additional funding that would do some things for our nations veterans that just will not be able to be handled if this budget goes through we will not be able to have care for veterans who are involved in radiation risk activities and subsequently develop cancer we will not have funding to increase longterm care programs for our aging veterans we will not have funding to restore the va psychiatric wards and an increase in mental illness research education we will not have funding to keep alzheimers veterans in hospitals we will not be able to treat the persian gulf war veterans who have come down tens of thousands of them with an unexplained illness and we will not have the money as this amendment will try to correct to fund new health care initiatives for veterans suffering from hepatitis crelated illness now this is a new situation and is why i have designated this funding as emergency hepatitis c is a disease which was only recently identified by reliable laboratory tests so in the past there has been no way to diagnose it at the time when veterans became infected this infection may not have produced any symptoms or mild ones similar to a flu at the time of service to our country the virus hides latent in the bcldy for many years and may not show up for 20 or 40 more years after the initial infection veterans at a particular risk for the disease include those who received blood or blood products prior to 1992 and veterans who worked in health care occupations are exposed to blood in combat situations veterans who were infected manyyears ago are now showing symptoms of the disease and too often this disease is fatal a fatal disease hepatitis c is now known to infect hundreds if not thousands of our veterans and we do not put the money in for this program my amendment would say that we have an emergency medical situation that we should fund 3 million to provide funding for serviceand presumed serviceconnection for veterans who are exposed to hepatitis c and make sure that we treat our veterans with the respect and commitment that we should i know this amendment has been challenged by point of order i assume that that challenge will be upheld by the chair at some point in

legislation and just in the last 24 hours they have come forward and admitted yes there is a problem and they are trying to find a political fig leaf to cover it this substitute the conyers amendment

technology association of america they want real legislation not a fig leaf that does not do the job that is feel good what has happened in this case is the larger companies the intels the oracles if they touch the problem if they make it better than it is now they can still be held liable for the full amount in a class action suit with joint and several liability because they are held as a defendant proportional liability i think is a much better range if someone touches a problem and makes it better they should not be held liable for the full amount just because they happen to be the deep pockets just because they happen to have the cash on hand to take the money from these companies that they should be investing in new products so that they compete on a global marketplace and instead put it into litigation into settlement into attorneys fees really undermines where we have gone as a country in this new economy and where we are in the global marketplace this guts the bill altogether this amendment they talk about this being a part of the contract with america actually this is a laser shot that goes after a problem that exists once every 1 000 years the y2k problem is unique because of the interconnectibility of computer systems and the fact that someone can have their whole system they can flush it they can test it it can be 100 percent clean and then some other group gets into it and talks to it that is not y2k compliant that they never could have conceived of could have used it comes in and messes it up and yet the group that is actually innocent can be held liable for the total amount that is what this amendment is it holds companies who are trying to improve it in addition to that this makes companies reluctant to fix the problem because if they fix the problem if they come in and help a computer system and it is still not 100 percent functional if they happen to be the deep pocket and they are a defendant under joint and several liability they can be liable for the whole thing what that means is the problem is not getting fixed or if they are getting fixed the larger companies are going to the smaller companies and having them write off indemnities and the like that just do not make any sense in the ordinary marketplace make no mistake about what this amendment does it guts the bill and it is a political fig leaf they talk too

in light of information that it received from the defendant unlike the bill the substitute does not create a mitigation requirement if the plaintiff becomes or should have become aware of the information from other sources that is a loophole one can drive a mack truck through it does nothing in terms of mitigation in this case unless there is a formal notification which so often is many months later even though they can go publicly and acknowledge these things over television the media and other areas if someone could easily avoid damage by taking a simple step which he or she should

moral issue this article describes how some members of the business community in florida approached one of our colleagues saying that passing mfn was a moral issue that extending normal trade status to china is a moral necessity this could be a dangerous line of reasoning for those who favor granting china mfn particularly given chinas human rights record in light of what so many chinese citizens face at the hands of the chinese government the term moral is of concern there are now at least eight roman catholic bishops being held in prison here is a picture of one of those bishop jia he had been arrested on august 15 1999 been arrested to prevent him from conducting mass on an important roman catholic feast he is 66 years old has been in jail in a chinese labor camp for 20 years i will tell the gentleman from florida this is a moral issue just a few days ago the chinese government arrested another roman catholic bishop surrounding him late in the night by 150 policemen scores of roman catholic laymen were arrested this is a moral issue countless protestant house church leaders have been arrested and imprisoned simply for practicing their faith here is a photo of pastor li showing the police grabbing him and taking him off to jail he has been in and out of prison since 1983 this is a moral issue i have been to china i have been to tiananmen square and seen where the tanks have rolled over the people and flattened them in the wake i have been to beijing prison number one where tiananmen square demonstrators were working on socks to export to united states this i would tell the gentleman from florida is a moral issue i visited tibet several years ago in tibet the chinese have raped and pillaged that peaceful country committing untold atrocities upon the tibetan population scores of buddhist monks and nuns are in prison because of their faith this is a moral issue there are more prison labor camps in china now than there were when solzhenitzen wrote the book gulag archipelago this is a moral issue the muslims in china are being persecuted daily and no one speaks out this is a moral issue as a member of congress i am able to attend various national security briefings that i cannot go into here on the house but i can say that the chinese military presents fundamental dangers to the west and to our men and women in the armed services we need to tread very carefully in our actions which give aid to the chinese military and the government and who knows what the future may hold where the battle lines could be drawn this is a moral issue the peoples liberation army are dumping assault weapons into the united states that are killing women and children this is a moral issue so i would say that the clinton administration and others in support of mfn should be careful in crafting their arguments in support of mfn by using moral language this administration has done little or nothing to speak up with regard to chinas human rights going so far as to actually meet with the chinese officials in tiananmen square this administration has done nothing in many of these areas so in closing there are good people on both sides of the

gentlemen have they written the state department to ask that the pastor be released have they written the state department to say please let the bishop out he has been in jail for 20 years my sense is they have not and this i would tell my colleagues on both sides of the issue this is the moral issue that this congress will have to face every segment of the united states is opposed to granting mfn

member would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the va hud and independent agencies appropriations subcommittee the distinguished ranking minority member and all members of the subcommittee for the important but difficult work they did under the tight budget caps imposed in 1997 once again this subcommittee undoubtedly has struggled to complete the tough task of allocating limited resources among many deserving programs as a member of the house banking committee the committee with jurisdiction over federal housing programs this member is very interested in how funds are appropriated in this area although there are numerous deserving programs included in this funding bill this member would like to emphasize five points first this member in particular would like to comment favorably upon the treatment of some housing programs section 8 section 184 section 202 and section 811 programs probably were funded as adequately as we can under the budgetary restraints in particular this member commends the 6 million appropriation for the section 184 program the american indian housing loan guarantee program which he authored this seems to be a program with excellent potential which this member notes without appropriate modesty in recognizing the support received from many colleagues is for the first time providing private mortgage fund resources for indians on reservations through a federal government guarantee program for those indian families who have in the past been otherwise unable to secure conventional financing due to the trust status of indian reservation land second this member applauds the subcommittee for reducing the duplicative efforts of the federal government in rural housing and economic development after a funding level of 32 million in fiscal year 1999 for rural housing and economic development efforts in hud the subcommittee appropriated no money in fiscal year 2000 for huds rural housing efforts however unfortunately a setaside of 10 million is still allocated from cdbg for rural housing and economic development as a longterm advocate of rural housing during my tenure in the house this member nevertheless believes that we need to be careful of duplication and waste of financial resources in the efforts of the federal governments programs for rural housing and economic development the united states department of agriculture through their rural development offices has housing and development staff located throughout each state we do not need to hire new hud community builders to duplicate their work as suggested by the administration third however this member would like to emphasize his concerns about the community development block grant cdbg provisions in this act the cdbg program is proposed to be cut from a funding level of 4 750 billion in fiscal year 1999 to 4 5 billion for fiscal year 2000 a reduction of 250 million this member would like to certainly support the restoration of funds for cdbg to the fiscal year 1999 level in the conference committee the cdbg program not only is valuable to the larger entitlement cities it gives assistance to those communities under 50 000 through state administering agencies it is a government program with minimal overhead and bureaucracy moreover the cdbg program has provided invaluable dollars to cities and rural communities for such things as affordable housing public infrastructure and economic development specifically in nebraska cdbg dollars have recently been used in rural counties to meet their recent hurryup demand for the development of important comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances as a result of concerns over the placement of megasized hog production factories with regard to cdbg this member is pleased to commend the subcommittee on reducing the overall setasides by 266 5 million as compared to last year this member has testified at the subcommittee level that the expenditure of the maximum amount of cdbg funds should be left to the allocation of the state and eligible entitlement governments as compared to selected setaside programs fourth this member would also express his opposition to the elimination of the funding for the americorps program as contemplated by this appropriations bill the funding for the americorps program should be restored in the conference committee lastly this member is aware of huds concerns with the reduced level of this subcommittees appropriation however it is important to note that overall congress is providing more than 26 billion for housing and community development across the country an increase of 2 billion from the fiscal year 1999 mark moreover 18 new hud program initiatives deserve a thorough review by the authorizing committees before they are launched according to the general accounting office hud has requested more than 700 million for these ambiguously defined and in some casesquestionable new initiatives this member definitely believes we place an emphasis on funding proven current programs instead of understanding a wide variety of new initiatives many of which lend themselves to the use of discretion for political rewards because of the necessity to fund important housing and community development programs and despite the reservations expressed this member would encourage his colleagues to support h r 2684 the va hud

rules in trade but more importantly they strengthen unitedstates law to provide quick and effective weapons if there is a violation the bill includes language from levinbereuter urging that the wto approve both the prcs and taiwans accession in the same general council session all of these provisions are major improvements that make this overall package a good bill we are entering into a trade agreement with china that will create a more balanced relationship than any initiative to date this debate should be about ensuring that china plays by the rules in trade and that they honor

detention facilities are bulging to the point that many noncitizen convicts could be released into society in the near future this is wrong those who abuse their immigration status by committing crimes in this country must not be allowed to stay the ins is already overburdened and underfunded to the extent that it cannot fulfill its enforcement mission this situation is only made worse when it is forced to deal with individuals whose home countries refuse to take them back the federal government spends approximately 67 per day and 80 million per year to detain these individualssometimes indefinitely for this reason i am in strong support of congressman deals amendment i have been working on similar legislation myself it is ridiculous that we continue to grant immigration visas to countries who will not cooperate with our law enforcement efforts there must be some recourse in fact we already have the legal authority to do something the state department can sanction these countries by denying them immigrant and nonimmigrant visas however the agency has never used this authority we cannot continue to let unitedstates taxpayers bear the burden of other countries reprehensible behavior and of our own governments unwillingness to take aggressive action to correct this problem we must put the administration and the state department on notice that weakening our policies toward criminal noncitizens is not acceptable if a criminal from mexico or israel must be deported so must a criminal from vietnam or russia therefore i would urge my colleagues to support

pendulum has swung too far to the left many americans believe that america has lost its way when our schools ignore the morals and the values that built this great nation but too many of the liberals in education have such a hostile attitude towards religion that they can not even conceive of a tolerant multidenominational religious presence in the public square which does not harm anyones rights their caricatures of religious people are nothing but unfair stereotypes and they falsely portray the agenda of ordinary people who think that religiouslyinspired values are something to be proud of

in this country and i especially want to thank the gentleman from california and the chairman of the committee the gentleman from pennsylvania and the other members who have helped us craft this bipartisan bill people around the world know of the old order amish as people who till their land and direct their lives with faith simplicity and discipline traditionally amish communities are centered around the family farm which requires input from the whole family while caring for crops and animals amish parents show their children how to make a living without exposure to outside influences that contradict their beliefs however due to the high growth rate the soaring price of farmland many amish have been forced to look for alternatives to farming now amish can be found in small businesses making raw lumber clocks wagons cabinetry and quilts therefore as they did on the family farm and still do and i might say that in farm work the children are totally exempt from child labor laws one can find a 10yearold boy driving a team of mules i would like to see the gentleman from missouri try that the amish now wish to have their youth work with them in these vocational settings typically the youth will learn a trade after the completion of amish school or the eighth grade and be selfsufficient by age 18 the amish view this work as part of their schooling since they often accompany a parent to the workplace very similar to an apprenticeship and they call this learning by doing unfortunately these small amishowned businesses have received costly fines from the department of labor for having their young adults work alongside their fathers and uncles even in family businesses recently a businessman an amish businessman in my congressional district was fined 10 000 for having his own child in the front office of his business the teenager 15 years old was simply learning to use the cash register alongside her father she was far from harms way these actions by the department of labor have severely threatened the lifestyle and the religion of this respected and humble community the amish expect diligence responsibility and respect from their youth they do not contribute to the social ills of our society and they do not accept any assistance from government programs our government should not interfere with this humble community several of my colleagues along with our amish constituents met with the department of labor several times last year for a solution unfortunately we received nothing but negative responses from labor the amish have a very unique situation and they do not benefit from shop or votech like the youth of our schools my son at age 14 made furniture on a band saw in a shop class with 15 other students around we have a responsibility to evaluate the amish in light of these things and that is why the gentleman from california and i and others have introduced this legislation narrowly crafted and we urge support"],

committee and the ranking member the gentleman from maryland for their hard work on this important bill the foster care independence act of 1999 we can all remember how hard growing up can be fortunately for most of us we had loving and supportive of family and parents to nurture encourage and teach us how to gradually enter adulthood i could never imagine the feelings of fear or uncertainty that a foster care approaching his or her 18th birthday must have while most teens are celebrating their graduation from high school and working at parttime jobs while they anxiously wait to leave for college foster children are trying to figure out how to find a job and who will pay enough to put a roof over their head and to put food on their own table last year florida had 3 103 youths who were eligible for independent living programs although some of these kids have foster parents who stick with them and are willing to help including giving them money out of their own pockets many have been shuffled around so much that they do not have anyone to turn to these foster children have barely been able to be kids and suddenly they are forced to become instant adults it is no wonder that many of them end up on the streets or on welfare or as teenaged parents by getting states to provide 18 to 21yearold foster children with job training job skills financial planning classes information on higher education counseling life skills housing and health care we are giving these kids a better chance to become responsible adults we are giving them a chance to have a life that is not characterized by fear and by hardship we are giving them their independence not only from their foster parents but from federal assistance but we are also preparing them to handle this independence and to make choices that lead to positive results my own state of florida has already provided medicaid and tuition assistance to older foster children there are many programs that teach independent living skills however we can not always reach all of the children that need these services or provide all of the programs in every area of the state this bill will enhance the ability it
