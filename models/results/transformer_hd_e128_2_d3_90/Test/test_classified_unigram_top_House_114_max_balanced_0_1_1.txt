like to have that capability because sometime maybe somehow we may have a nuclear war and we will expend all of our existing bombs and we will need to somehow make more i am not exactly sure why we

recovery or in honor of equal pay day we should debate and vote on the paycheck fairness act to ensure that women get paid for equal work a fulltime working woman still earns significantly less than what a man earns for comparable work it turns out that women earn nearly 25 cents less than a man for doing the same work achieving equal pay for women should be the top of our priority list but unfortunately this republican majority has denied us a vote on this critical issue today instead we will consider two pieces of legislation under a closed process to roll back important doddfrank

enforcement priorities for removal now in addition to that the supreme court has recognized in many cases the needand really the authority of the executiveto make these decisions in the arizona case

policy of nonenforcement founded upon prosecutorial discretion on the grounds that the policy violated the take care clause deferred action is nothing more than a tentative revocable signal to a noncitizen that the government does not intend to initiate removal proceedings at this time not only is that tentative but the statute at unitedstatesc 1182 a 9 b ii authorizes the period of stay by

and chairman murtha over the years i have had the privilege of working with them on this question of posttraumatic stress disorder i just want to use a little anecdote particularly as it relates to vietnam vets many of us remember vietnam vets coming back and some long years later getting a better understanding of agent orange i remember a vietnam vet telling me about it but as he indicated they mentioned it or spoke about it or tried to explain it when they came back directly from vietnam it was a long time before the understanding came about agent orange and in years going forward there was great medical care needed medical costs needed because those veterans had been suffering for a long time we now understand posttraumatic stress disorder and as i look over the landscape of the last

very unifying entity in our community the childrens museum as one of the original board members and founders now the childrens museum is one of the major childrens museums in the nation but again it

john guess he needs a fuller embrace by the smithsonian including its expertise its experts its ph d s traveling efforts and again its encouragement of corporate communities to recognize the value of participating in museums the smithsonians outreach activities include the smithsonian institution traveling exhibition the smithsonian center for education and museum studies national science resources center the smithsonian institution press the office of fellowships and the smithsonian associates who are we if we do not value preserving those items that tell the varied and diverse history of america the good history of america the history that is unifying and purposeful in citing us as a country that recognizes our wonderful diversity so i ask my colleagues to support this

growth and expanded geographic distribution during sustained periods of economic retrenchment but also because it is imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling financially yet eager to participate in smithsonian outreach for communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic downturn the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions the mobile museum promises to answer an evergrowing demand for smithsonian shows in the field a single conventional sites exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 locations over a twoto threeyear period in contrast a mobile museum exhibit can visit up to three venues per week in the course of only one year at no cost to the host institution or community the net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach locations to which sites shows can travel annually and in addition to its flexibility in making shortterm stops in cities and towns from coasttocoast a mobile museum has the advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people live work and take part in leisure time activities by establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these sites will not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million but also advance a key smithsonian performance objective to develop exhibit approaches that address diverse audiences including population groups not always affiliated with

jackson lee and also the former ranking mem"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume as always i very much appreciate the assistance of mr engel in moving this resolution today to the house floor and i commend ms kelly a new member of the committee for her focus on this important issue the africa subcommittee chairman chris smith and the ranking member of that committee karen bass have also done indepth work on nigeria and on boko haram in particular i appreciate their travels to nigeria nigeria holds a critical presidential election this weekend it is expected to be the continents most consequential political event in years africas most populous nation has over 70 million registered voters who will report to more than 100 000 polling stations i had the opportunity with don payne to lead a delegation years ago with election observer responsibility there for one of these national elections in nigeria along with general colin powell at the time let me tell you the political environment is always tense but it is especially tense now the leading candidates are neck and neck as was the case then i just have to say that we have seen nigeria transition from military rule to democracy in the election that general powell and i witnessed and that was a very peacefulvery peacefultime but recent elections in nigeria have seen political violence and we are right to be concerned this resolution urges all political candidates to respect their pledges of nonviolence and insist that the government hold a free fair and credible election and that they do so on time this election date has already been postponed once meanwhile nigeria continues to face grave insecurity in the north at the hands of boko haram which loosely translates to western education is sin this islamist terrorist organization indiscriminately kills in mass and pillages villages in their quest to establish a sharia state satellite images document that after boko haram comes through villages are literally wiped off the map the group is responsible for 5 000 deaths last year in 2014 and displacing over 1 million people last year making this organization by the way one of the worlds most deadly but this weekend forces fighting boko haram reported discovering another hundred bodies in a shallow mass grave we dont really know how many they have killed out there in total but we know that the killing continues after watching boko harams violence i wasnt surprised to see that that group pledges allegiance to isis isis publicly accepted the overture claiming this new relationship expands their selfdeclared caliphate to west africa at the same time we have seen boko harams propaganda increase in quality mimicking the production of isis videos sweeping what we call the virtual caliphate on the internet so the good news is that nigerias neighbors chad niger and cameroon have all been making progress in the fight against boko haram under a newly established african union regional force they have rescued more than 30 northern nigerian towns to date from boko haram and from that harsh rule this is a good beginning but this african union regional force lacks equipment and it lacks training this resolution expresses the houses support for robust security assistance to these troops in their fight against boko haram nevertheless we cannot rely solely on other countries in the region nigerias security forces should have the lead role to play if dismantling boko haram is the goal we need a welltrained wellequipped nigerian military we must make sure there are no impediments legislative or otherwise to providing this muchneeded assistance i reserve the balance of my time"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "i would like to elaborate on the chairmans retort to what we just heard about criticisms pertaining to this law number one this law is inherently unfair trying to finance health insurance for some americans by cutting hours and wages for other americans is just frankly not what we should be doing as a country the save american workers act would actually save most workers from a potentially massive loss in hours and wages and i will walk the gentleman through that momentarily it will also cause fewer workers to be directly impacted by this employer mandate very briefly let us start with saving most workers from a potentially massive cut in hours under current law if you work between 40 to say 45 hours and your employer happens to not offer you employersponsored health insurance you are in the minority an employer is incentivized to offer these typically higherwage higherskilled workers employersponsored health insurance and that is why so many do it is part of our normal functioning labor market so if one were to be moved hypothetically from 40 hours down to 29 hours they would lose roughly 270 a week or 14 000 a year according to the american action forum under the save american workers act these 40 to 45hour workweek individuals would no longer be at risk of such a massive cut in their wages or their hours lets take someone working 30 to 35 hours just above that new fulltime employment threshold in obamacare they tend to be lowerwage hourly workers according to the hoover institution and lets assume they had no employersponsored health insurance there are 9 8 million americans who fall into this category they are vulnerable to a cut in their hours and wages were one to move from 35 hours a week down to 29 they would lose on average 148 per week or 7 694 a yearagain according to the american action forum under the save american workers act these individuals 30 to 35 hours a week would no longer lose any hours or wages just reinforcing the point that the good chairman made well this is why i introduced the save american workers act lets restore the 40hour workweek that so many people worked so hard to put in place that has long been understood to be the gold standard of the workweek in this country over the past few years i have witnessed a strange phenomenon in our country in indiana we have seen local school corporations announce they will limit the hours of substitute teachers classroom assistants cafeteria workers custodians we have seen retailers limit the hours of their cashiers the list goes on and on from hotels to manufacturers to colleges and universities i guarantee that every member of this body back in their district has heard similar stories this is happening because of the new 30hour definition of fulltime employment now there is no good reason to do this other than perhaps to arbitrarily set this new definition of fulltime employment to fund the massive cost of this national health care bill it has ignored decades of practice in the labor market reality of our 40hour workweek it has distorted that market as a result the hoover institution estimates that as many as 2 6 million american workers are at risk for lost hours now it is not just the lost hours that should concern us again it is the lost wages an employee losing 10 hours a week is also losing an entire weeks paycheck each month an employee going from 35 to 29 hours is seeing a 17 percent pay cut courtesy of obamacare the people most affected by this provision are the people who can least afford it89 percent of them do not have college degrees 63 percent of them are women perhaps ironically it sounds a lot like the people obamacare was supposed to help cbo analysis indicates that it comes at the expense of up to 105 billion in cash wages now i defy anyone to say that it is fair to expand coverage to a halfmillion peoplethat number from the cboon the backs of 2 5 million people who cant afford it how fundamentally inefficient is the health care system that potentially requires the loss of over 200 000 in cash wages for each person it insures i authored h r 30 the save american workers act to help these hardworking americans and i introduced this bill jointly with the gentleman from illinois who happens to be a democrat he too realizes that obamacare is littered with serious unintended consequences that need to be addressed in the senate we have seen a similar version of this bill introduced in a bipartisan manner"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "i will be brief and also try to improve just a little bit on a very good bill my congratulations to the team and to the ranking member and to the chairman

diseases under the fda priority review voucher program for tropical diseases while evidence of human infection by the zika virus has been reported for over 60 years there has been little progress in the development of treatment or vaccines existing incentives have been insufficient to encourage development of new and innovative treatments for the virus however with the recent spread of the virus from south america to the caribbean and north america the level of infection has reached pandemic levels although the zika virus may be rare in the united states the increase of airline transportation immigration and tourism only creates an environment for the zika virus to be easily transmitted s 2512 would allow the fda priority review voucher program to work exactly as intended it would add the zika virus to the list of tropical diseases that are available under the voucher program this bill would ultimately accomplish two goals first it would provide an incentive for drug developers in the form of fasttrack approval of therapies to treat the zika virus second it would create an avenue where treatments for the virus would get to patients quicker and ultimately end this pandemic outbreak

integrity with stakeholder advisories act also known as the ovisa act i support this bipartisan legislation because it will strengthen the role of labor unions in the 0 visa petition process a process by which international artists and entertainers with extraordinary ability are brought to the united states 1730 as many of you may know my home state of georgia is one of the nations leading locations for film and television production since the state updated its tax laws this industry has generated approximately 800 million annually in economic development and it is credited with supporting about 11 000 jobs in georgia in june alone there were more than 23 movies and tv shows being filmed in the state and as more studios and production teams move to georgia the demand for international talent will continue to rise while international audiences have a strong appreciation and demand for american movies music and other forms of entertainment we also want talent from other countries to come to the united states for our enjoyment in such instances however we must ensure that the immigration process effectively balances the needs of the entertainment industry while protecting the rights and interests of american workers congress has long realized that this is a delicate balance which is why we created a specific role for american labor unions to participate in the 0 visa petition process for foreign artists and entertainers unions help ensure safe working conditions and fair wages for all regardless of nationality under the 0 visa consultation process unions provide informed opinions on these significant issues the bill before us today makes an important change to current law it requires the unitedstates citizenship and immigration services to provide labor organizations the results of decisions for cases in which they submitted advisory opinions this new requirement will bring transparency to the 0 visa process in addition this measure will enable labor unions to better monitor the outcomes of 0 visa cases and reduce uncertainty about the number of entertainment jobs filled by international artists h r 3636 will further strengthen international artistic exchange while promoting american workers in closing i want to thank my colleagues on the judiciary committee representatives mimi walters and jerrold nadler for their
