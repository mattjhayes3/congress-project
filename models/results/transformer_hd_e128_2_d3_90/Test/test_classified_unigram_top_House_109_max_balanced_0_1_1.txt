most powerful republican in the house promised a vote in 2004 he promised a vote by memorial day now he promised a vote i think he means it this time by it is simple the reason we have not voted on the central american free trade agreement and that is because of the broad opposition in this house and among the american people republicans and democrats by the dozens in this house oppose the central american free trade agreement business organizations labor unions both in the united states and in the six latin american countries oppose the central american free trade agreement the latin american council of churches as do many religious leaders and churches and organizations in the united states oppose the central american free trade agreement environmentalists active environmentalists food safety advocates all kinds of very broadbased organizations oppose the central american free trade agreement today the gentleman from north carolina and i did a news conference at the capitol with 23 business leaders speaking out business leaders representing 23 businesses speaking out against the central american free trade agreement the reason is simply that our policy is not working our trade policy in this country has failed us for 12 years just look at this chart since 1992 the year i was elected to congress the trade deficit number of dollars worth of exports versus imports our trade deficit internationally was 38 billion today after nafta pntr tpa all these trade agreements our trade deficit last year was 618 billion from 38 billion to 618 billion now maybe those are just numbers but those numbers translate into something much more important than economist data these numbers translate into manufacturing job losses the states in red have lost 20 percent of their manufacturing in the last 5 years the states in blue have lost 15 to 20 percent ohio my state 217 000 jobs lost michigan 210 000 illinois 224 000 these are just manufacturing job losses people who make a decent wage a middleclass wage who have health benefits who have earned pensions thousands hundreds of thousands of them have lost their jobs 228 000 in north carolina 130 000

hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs our the trade policy is not working cafta is more of the same cafta is a dysfunctional cousin of the north american free trade agreement it was an agreement that was negotiated by the select few benefiting the select few now supporters of cafta tell us as they always do in trade agreements that as a result of this agreement unitedstates companies will export more products to the developing world unfortunately if you look at this chart that is simply not the case the unitedstates typical average wage is 38 000 the average wage in el salvador is 4 800 honduras 2 600 nicaragua 2 300 to say that people in those countries are going to buy products made in this country simply does not pass the credibility test hondurans are not going to be able to

others as they offer their ideas for how we can bring our troops home and move toward a peaceful but constructive role in the rebuilding of iraqi society this morning brought news of a deadly series of bombings in iraq killing american soldiers and iraqi civilians more than 150 people in all making it one of the deadliest days of this horrific war is this what the march of freedom looks like is this what vice president cheney meant when he said the insurgency was in its last throes it is more clear than ever that the american military presence is inspiring terrorist insurgents rather than defeating them al qaeda has taken credit for this wave of violence and al qaeda was not even a factor in iraq before the unitedstates led occupation began the american people understand this nearly twothirds of them give the president poor marks on his handling of iraq they are desperate to hear alternatives to the administrations disastrous policy that is why i have organized this hearing tomorrow to give voice to a widely heldconviction to spark a national debate to demonstrate that many of us do not want to just speak out against the war we want to discuss pragmatic nutsandbolts solutions in fact a road map to our very disengagement that discussion should eventually go beyond iraq to include a complete reassessment of our national security priorities it is time to end the reflexive impulse of using military force to solve our international conflict it has by the way the appearance of strength but as iraq has shown us it often undermines our national security rather than enhancing it i have proposed a new approach it is called smart security it stands for sensible multilateral american response to terrorism smart is based on the belief that war should be an absolute last resort to be undertaken only under the most extreme circumstances but that does not mean smart is not serious and smart about protecting america it is vigilant about fighting terrorism and weapons of mass destruction but it does so with stronger multilateral alliance improved intelligence capabilities vigorous inspection regimes and aggressive diplomacy smart would shuffle our national security budget no more billions tl4rown at outdated cold war weapons programs that money would instead be invested in energy independence and other efforts that truly are relevant to the modern security threats that we face smart also includes an ambitious international development agenda to help address the root causes of terrorism democracy building education for women and girls addressing resources scarcity these are key ingredients to building stable societies in iraq and elsewhere it is my hope and belief that the grievous mistakes we made in iraq will lead us to this new

cannot support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans i believe that the second amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majority in the senate i regret that under the guise of helping gun owners

amtrak this is a railroad in desperate need of reform this year alone amtrak will carry over 120 million in funds that were provided to them by the congress in fiscal year 2005 but not used the dot inspector general an official respected on both sides of the aisle has informed us that 1 275 billion is sufficient for amtrak to continue operating its existing route structure ithout reductions in frequency and to dedicate sufficient resources to continue the effort to bring amtrakowned infrastructure to a state of good repair also included in this figure is 278 million to meet amtraks debt service obligations on its nearly 4 billion in outstanding loans hope vi is a program that is just that for many people hope that the grant to create new public housing will actually be spent in their neighborhoods currently over 2 8 billion in hope vi grants has not been spent only 37 of the 224 communities have actually seen the finished product for those 37 communities hope vi is a terrific program and i was a supporter of hope vi for that reason because there are some good examples however hope vi is not working for the other 187 here is another program in desperate need of reform and i am hopeful for that in the coming year with whatever level of funding is provided for the program the authorizing committees of jurisdiction will look for ways to make this program more effective section 722 of the senate bill deals with micropurchases i believe the administration has already acted on this issue and we are supportive of the senates provisions in the end we recognize the challenges of reform and have not abandoned our commitment to fund good programs we will do our best under this allocation that we have to meet to fund the priority programs including hope vi and

it combined two distinct and separatelyoffered amendments into one in terms of the personal privileges violated by the report the misreportingand the malreporting of the amendments offered by my
