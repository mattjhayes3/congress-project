the real kernel of the whole issue today because it is past midnight we are going to be discussing probably as important an economic package as we have ever faced certainly as i have ever faced during my time here in the house i would just like to talk a little bit about it i know there are not too many people here and i wish there were more people here it is late and we are all tired but i think it is important important to everybody in this country who is interested in jobs in security in deficit reduction you know i give president clinton great credit for asking for change and i think the american people responded to that he held the torch high and he said believe in me and we can have change and it is for the better and we are going to concentrate on the economy you know a lot of people could have done that and they have not he did we should appreciate that fact i guess where i come down is that i do not think that he is being properly served by those people who are putting the economic plan together because i think what he wants and what he says and what actually is coming to this floor for votes are not the same thing let me tell you why i do not think ever in the history of mankind has a tax increase stimulated the economy you may say well you dont want to stimulate the economy but the president does we all want to one of the things we are looking out on now is unemployment we want people to believe we want them to invest we want them to employ but if i say to you who are business people who are individuals who own homes who are interested in your own activities please employ please invest because we need to pick this economy up because if the whole tide comes up we all benefit we cannot do this in individual pockets so you say fine what are you going to do here in congress and what we say is this look we have got to fix the deficit and therefore we are going to increase taxes and then you say but you know there must be another way of doing this you ask me to invest and to employ and yet you say i am going to throw on you a huge new cost and furthermore there is a train coming out of the station which says health care which may be up to another 100 billion they say in additional costs so what are you going to do are you going to buy a new car are you going to invest in your business are you going to employ somebody else no you are not you are going to wait because you just do not know what is going to happen you know business is two things it is timing and psychology one of the big problems i have with this particular package is it flies in the face of what we want now you have all these fancy 3story minds and you have these brilliant rhodes scholars but at the same time people like us are out there and we are in the real world we have met payrolls we have to renegotiate our loans we have got to go down and ask for extensions on our taxes so why should we do the things which the president wants with these huge new costs and expenses on us we are not going to do it and frankly it does not make any sense so what you have got to do you have got to balance what you want to do with the economy with deficit reduction now let me talk a little bit about deficit reduction i was down here in 1982 at the time of the grace commission and i headed up one of the teams our expenses at that time were 5800 billion now it is 1 trillion 500 billion our income at that time was 5600 billion if i had said to you iii tell youwhat ill do ill increase your income by a factor of 2 in the next 10 years can you hold your expenses to a 50percent increase any family could do that any business could do it no we cannot so deficit reduction is not a matter of taxes it is a matter of cost control and that is expensive i guess that is what we are pleading for it is a perfectly human reaction it is a reaction we understand you do not when you are in trouble in a business increase your prices you cut your costs and that is what we are not doing here let me say one other thing this is a highrisk economic policy and i will give you an example we have a debt of 4 trillion 200 billion a lot of money 4 trillion you can hardly pronounce it do you know that 70 to 75 percent of that debt is in socalled treasury bonds which have a maturity of less than 5 years now if there is anything we learn as we are growing up you do not borrow short to pay long you do not borrow on a shortterm basis to pay something long and that is going to come and hurt us furthermore we are further shortening it so the deficit package and the debt package does not make any sense i am sorry about this i want to support our president but under the circumstances i cannot"], [0.48656487464904785, 0.48656487464904785, 0, "i feel like a prizefighter pumped up i thank the gentleman for yielding to me i would just like to say when the gentleman from ohio asks you to come to a meeting the way he just said when he said that you go to the meeting you dont ask any questions about that so that is relatively simple i cannot thank the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from minnesota enough for what they have done to really in my judgment and i think in the judgment of all six of us who are handling this debate tonight to energize this particular issue for true cuts in washington dc every single one of us in this building goes home and when we go home we see the individuals who have lost their jobs or those who have had to cut back on their expenditures because they did not have enough money or their spouse lost a job or a child is sick or whatever it may be we have seen businesses which are not making it for various reasons and some drop by the wayside they go into bankruptcy and they have to go on and do something else but they have to pay their bills they know that eventually they are going to have to pay the piper in some way or another and they are going to have to somehow or another be able to earn the money in order to do that we see our local governments we see our city governments we see our country governments and we see our state governments they are doing the same thing they are fighting like heck to balance their budgets as a matter of fact practically every state in the united states of america has now adopted a balanced budget amendment i think all but one at this point have done it because they understand and the people have stressed the importance of balancing that budget we ran for office and then we go out there and we talk about the federal government i will guarantee that those same rotary meetings that the gentleman from new jersey referred to that people raise their hands and say why cant the federal government balance its budget why does the federal government have so many programs why does the federal government spend so much money there were i guess about 30 of us that the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from minnesota brought together for the idea of talking about can we make a difference as far as this is concerned it was a group of individuals who care a great deal about this country about their president and about what is happening in the united states of america we sat down and talked about the issues we broke up into little groups and we figured out what we could really do that would make true budget cuts in the united states of america but would not harm people or programs in such a way that they could not function in the future we went over this we went over this we went over it at different levels we eventually debated it it got done i believe every single program that is included in there is something that can indeed handle the reductions which have been proposed and where is the opposition coming from it is coming from the white house it is certainly coming from within this building it is coming from the appropriators and we all have our letters threatening various projects that may not get renewed if indeed we try to cut this particular money and vote the wrong way tomorrow it comes from the interest groups and i do not know how extensive they are but i know of one union in my home which wrote and said gee we dont want you to cut back on the cost of living increases and raise retirement ages and then when we took some of that out because there was so much opposition to it they indicated that they did not want to be in a union with other people who were going to have their retirement ages raised even if they were not which is an incredible rationale when you get right down to it are the arguments we are hearing really sound would it destroy changing health care i do not think so would it really depress the economy you heard the figures and i think the gentleman from ohio used some of the figures as did others and it is a very slight reduction as far as economic progress of the united states is concerned will it destroy government programs that has got to be a joke i do not know how small cuts such as this could possibly destroy any government programs most of which are already overfunded will it decimate our defense beyond repair again that is just beyond reason to be able to make that representation but the real issue is maybe not what is happening at the white house and not what the appropriators and the chairs of the committees think that we work with or even what these interest groups that have contacted us think the real issue is what do the people of the united states think what about that 99 some percent that we have not heard from at all where are they tonight what are they thinking if they are smart they are home in bed asleep but what are they thinking at this point i would suggest that they are thinking why can we not live here in congress the way they live at home with those businesses that are trying to make it with the accountants at home where it is a struggle to meet the bills each week and each month why can we not eliminate the waste we have heard so much about and clearly is there why can we not sunset outdated programs why cannot the government run more efficiently why cannot runaway government be checked in some way or another what should we do about it as members of congress i have a lot of ideas i personally think we should pass lineitem veto we got within 21 votes this year we should have a balanced budget amendment in the united states and that is going to be difficult to do because it would have to be done in the future we should sunset some programs we probably should go to 2year budgeting i am not sure i understand that concept but it seema to make sense from what i have read about it but the truth of the matter is we are going to have one real great opportunity before we go home this year before we go home to the chamber of commerce to give the speech in the editorial board to say what we are doing to cut expenditures in the unitedstates government to make congress balance its budget and we are going to have that chance tomorrow when we look at the pennykauich bill and we make our docision if we are going to vote yes or no more or leas in the range of 211 of us are going to have to vote yes on that particular very sgnificant piece of legislation we are going to have to cast aside the special interests and those who feel their oxes being gored and we are going to have to think about the people of the united states of america and what they really want and where we can really begin this process and it is only a beginning there is a tremendous amount more that we have to do if we are really going to deal with the concepts of balancing budgets and making government programs funded in such a way that they are streamlined and they meet the methodologies of going ahead that we should follow in this country but this is the opportunity this is the time for republicans this is the time for democrats to stand up and to cast their votes in what is going to be in my view the most significant vote we are going to cast in the congress this year i hope the whole country is looking at that vote tomorrow and i hope when that vote ti called for that we deliver the majority needed in order to have a real victory before this year is out and i thank the gentleman for yielding"], [0.48684069514274597, 0.48684069514274597, 0, "president clinton in his state of the union message talked about his plan to deal with the deficit and the republican study committee which i chair spent the entire weekend studying president clintons budgetary proposals and what kind of an impact it would have either positive or negative on the united states of america here is what we found there were 325 5 billion in tax increases the largest tax increase in unitedstates history by more than 60 or 70 percent the largest before that was around 184 billion in addition to that there are 70 billion in hidden fee and get this they are called spending cuts they have got 70 billion in fees in there that are called spending cuts when that is actually more money coming out of taxpayers pockets when you talk about spending cuts he has been telling america about this there are spending cuts totaling 91 7 billion but there are spending increases totaling 185 9 billi6n for a net increase of 94 2 billion so when he tells you he is going to cut spending the fact of the matter is we are not cutting domestic spending we are increasing it by over 94 billion on top of that there are 395 billion in new taxes and hidden fee increases the only spending cuts in his budgetary propolal that we can find are in the area of defense and those cuts were going to take place anyhow and that is 112 billion so the deficit reduction plan he is talking about is not coming from spending cuts it is coming out of the hides of the american taxpayer now 2 years ago when we had the budget summit agreement and president bush erroneously i believe signed on to that agreement with the democrat majority in both the house and the senate weraised taxes on the backs of the american people to the tune of 182 billion and that tax increase cost us thousands and thousands of jobs and put this country into an economic recession that we are just now coming out of the tax increases president clinton is talking about in my view are going to cost at least 250 000 jobs in the next year to 18 months and it is going to put this country into an economic decline much worse than what we have seen in recent years now i was talking to one of my democrat colleagues today and i promised i would not use his name because he was sorry he said this but he meant it here is what he said with smile any tax you pass is going to put somebody out of business and that is the problem these huge tax increases are going to put a lot of marginal business people over the brink and they are going to go bankrupt today out in the hall just 5 or 10 minutes ago i talked to members from the farm bureau do you know what they told me the btu tax the energy tax which i call the big time unemployment tax the btutax is going to cost them so much that many of them will go out of business because they cannot pass those increased costs on to the consumer because of the way the agricultural markets work on the commodities exchange they cannot pass that on so a lot of small farmers and mediumsized and large farmers are going to go out of business if we pass the btu tax in addition i just had a bunch of people call me who are in the foundry business they rely on energy to make the molds and make the products that most of us in this country use it is one of the biggest industries in america they tell me that many foundries are going to go out of business if we pass this stu tax then we come to the airline industry and i am only going to mention three tonght but i can go on and on and on but the airline industry is going to be hit with a 15 centsper gallon jet fuel increase and many of those airlines if you have been reading in the papers are on the brink of bankruptcy now they are trying to cut deals with british airways and other foreign airlines just to stay above water here we are going to joad on the backs of the airlines one of the most important parts of commerce in this country another 15 cents per gallon fuel tax i guarantee itis going to put alot of them out of business every one of these companies that go out of business has enployees when they go out f business their emplqyees lose their jobs and when they lose their jobs that increases the unemployment rolls for each 1 percent of unemployment when you add in all of the benefits they get that costs the taxpayers and the treasury 342 billion this one little phase of his economic recovery program is a recipe for economic disaster so i am telling my friends across this country who say well we have to do something we have gdt to do something we want to cut that deficit cut the debt that is absolutely true when president clintonstood up here and he said to the american people it is not what is important for me it is what is important for us meaning the entire nation he was absolutely corpect but the solution is not these homongous tax increases which will make us less competitive tith our foreign trading partners will drive business out of this country and itake jobs along with it take money out of the taxpayers pockets withoutwhich they cannot buyproducts and if they donot buy the products they do not produce products and if they do nat produce products people lose their jobs and unemplqyment goesup the solution is to cut government spending ten yearsago we were bringing in 500 billion a year in tax revenues it is now 1 2trillion we have almost tripled the amount of tax revenues coming in in the last 10 years and yet we are still rumling deficits tof about 350 to 400 billion per year so what is the answer the answer s nut more taxes out of your hide america the answer is to cutspending now how do you do

deficit reduction plan that will reduce the deficitone that will cut spending and increase jobs in america a couple weeks ago i sent out a constituent newsletter to the people of the fourth congressional district as you might expect a good part of that newsletter was dedicated to the presidents tax bill and the reasons i felt it was bad for the country and the reasons why i opposed it in the original draft of the newsletter i made a couple lighthearted jabs at the presidents tax bill i mentioned that opposition to the bill was growing as more people learned more about it i said people started realizing that bill clintons economic plan is a lot like his haircutits much more vxpensive than it looks i also mentioned that the presidents btu tax was a technical energy termit stands for bill tricked you neither of those remarks was in the final version of my constituent newsletter they were both censored out by the house franking commission the franking commission would not approve the newsletter until i removed these two remarks they said they were too partisan but if this bill passes today and if you vote for this bill today you will not be able to hide behind smoke or mirrors and you will not be able to censor out the truth the btu tax was dropped in conference that is one of the few good things that did happen there but if you vote for this bill today the term btu still applies bill tricked you this is not what bill clinton promised in the election this is not what the american people voted for last november this is nnt even what bill clinton said it was tuesday night in his oval office fireside chat he is smooth and he is slick and he is a great teleprompter performer but regardless of how convincing the president may be this bill is still taxandspend pure and simple it will not cut the deficit it will not create jobs and it will not cut spending and no matter what you say you are not going to be able to hide the tax increases in this bill from the american zeople come next april 15 we treat criminals better than this bill treats taxpayers at least criminals are protected by the constitution from laws passed ex post facto you cannot make an act a crime retroactively and punish someone for it this bill punishes taxpayers for success after the fact all the way back to its amazing a lot of presidents have raised a lot of taxes but mr clinton is the first one who has managed to raise taxes before he was even sworn into office the clinton tax increases that we are voting on today actually go back and raise peoples taxes on income earned before mr clinton was even president i guess we should consider ourselves fortunate he could have made it retroactive even more and tried to tax the money people made when people were still making moneyduring the reagan years before the 1990 tax increase you can run and you can hide but even death is no protection against mr clintons appetite for new taxes like grave robbers in the night this bill raises the estate taxes on people who had the misfortune of dying since january it rips open the coffin and steals the silver dollars from the eyes of the dearly deceased if that is not punitive taxation i dont know what is i am not touching that grave diggers shovel you can hide behind the presidents assurances that this bill only taxes the rich but what about the jobs it destroys do you really think that small businesses the real job creators in this country are going to be able to expand and aire at the same time they are trying to come up with the money to pay their retroactive tax liability most small businesses partnerships and s corporations are taxed as individual income taxpayers and yes some of them are successful enough to be in the category that mr clinton calls the rich they are the folks who do the hiring and growing and who create 80 percent or more of the new jobs in this country by plowing their profits back into their business but if this tax bill passes small business wont be plowing back much they will be paying up new jobsdo not count on it the president is definitely right about one thing the people who do not get those new jobs which are not created because of his tax bill they definitely will not be paying higher taxes they will be unemployed retroactive taxation is not the only inequity here look at the taxes on senior citizens they are not richat least most of them six million social security households are going to be hit with the largest tax increase in the entire bill by having 85 percent of their social security benefits taxed rather than 50 percent the number will go up to 8 million by 1998 and higher every year after as inflation pushes more and more social security recipients over the threshold some 40 000 households in kentucky will be paying 32 million more in taxes because of this one provision and we arent talking about people with incomes over that magic 180 000 level that the president keeps using 57 percent of the taxes generated by the elderly surcharge will come from seniors with incomes under 75 000 even if you hold your nose long enough to get past the punitive retroactive tax increases and elderly surcharges in the bill you are left with one simple factthis bill just will not work it will not reduce the deficit tax increases wont reduce the federal deficit congress has proven this over and over again every time this body raises taxes it just turns around and raises spendings gimmicks like the presidents deficit reduction trust fund will not change that reality the promised spending cuts will not materialize and i have never seen a single economic model which even begins to suggest that you can create prosperity with tax increases it just cannot be done i ask you all to listen to the people for a minute they are sayingand they have been sayingcut spending first this bill does not do that it doesnt cut spending today it raises taxes yesterday it raises taxes today it raises taxes tomorrow but when it comes to spending cuts it only promises it only promises cuts some place down the road at some far off tomorrowa tomorrow that probably will never come we have heard those promises before we heard them in 1990 the taxes are still here but the promised budget cuts never came when i say there are no budget cuts in the bill i am of course speaking in relative terms there are some budget cutsthey are few and far betweenbut even these are phoney and temporary the presidents bill takes a token slap at federal employees cutting manning levels and freezing pay it slashes defense and it cuts reimbursements to doctors and hospitals but the only realistic way to cut federal employment costs over the long run is to improve efficiency or to cut the size of the federal government and to eliminate unnecessary programs as long as the federal government keeps growing we are going to need good qualified people to run those programs temporary employee cutbacks and pay freezes wont do the job but the presidents program doesnt cut back the growth of the government and it doesnt eliminate a single federal program the president does propose slashing defense spending in fact he plans to decimate national defense by cutting 127 billion but is that realistic i dont think so if he tries to cut that much some place along the line he is going to discover he doesnt even have enough aircraft carriers left for photo opportunities if he cuts as much as he proposes from national defense mr clinton is even going to have to ask mike dukakis to return the tank he used in the 1988 campaign and of course i think everybodyif they tell the truthrealizes we cant keep cutting the reimbursement for doctors and hospitals without destroying the quality of health care the savings arent real anyway the costs are just shifted out of the governments budget into the private sector so even the few cuts that are included in the presidents plan are phoney or temporary at best so overall the presidents plan was not improved very much in the conference process it is still a taxandspend bill the cuts are few what cuts there are are phoney and the taxes are very realretroactivejob killers the president would have us believe that he is our nations savior with a plan to heal the sick and raise the dead instead his proposal would sicken the economy and tax the dead it didnt have to be this way the republicans worked hard to come up with a realistic budget alternative that proposed real cuts in real programs but our proposal was frozen out early on the majority never gave it a chance or a second thought maybe if we defeat this bill we could get together and work out a real deficit reduction plan thats what we need to do this bill is not going to do the job you will not be able to hide behind empty promises backroom deals and censorship if this bill is enacted when april 15 comes around people are going to learn the truth it is a tax bill there is no fairness here just taxes i urge my colleagues to join me in defeating this mess"], [0.4869232177734375, 0.4869232177734375, 0, "mr chairman and members this is probably one of the more important amendments in the bill because it really represents what this bill has become not what i think it was intended to be all about unfortunately the gentleman from pennsylvania said there are no less than 23 new reporting requirements already included in this legislation the fact is that if you will look at the bill you will find beginning in section 111 and going through section 118 what the state and local plans must require literally you will find 57 pages of legislative mandates that must be included those 57 pages of mandated requirements in state and federal plans are going to transfer into how many untold pages of reporting requirements at the local level when the rules and the regulations are published the amendment that i am offering says we get a little bit carried away when we require schools to report down to the very last single percentile and that is exactly the language that i am trying to delete from the bill the language was included in the committee that requires that every school receiving chapter 1 funds must prove that at least 1 percent of their funds are being used for parental involvement programs i am all for parental involvement that is not the problem i am all for the government perhaps even mandating parental involvement that is not the problem i have got real problems though when we say to a school you have got to prove to us that atleast 1 percent of your money is being used for this particular program i have a school district and i know many of my colleagues have many many small school districts that are receiving and participating in the chapter 1 program one of my schools receives 36 000 a year do you know what that means that means that school has to prove to the federal government that they are spending 360 a year on parental involvement folks if we do not have any more confidence than that in local public education we ought to say so and eliminate it to ask schools to do those kinds of reporting requirements goes beyond any sense of what i would call ridiculous i would like to take some time and it is going to take some time but i would like to show you what a local lea has to do today to participate in the chapter 1 program as we know it one of our school districts was kind enough to make a copy of literally everything that they had to do there are no less than folks 95 pages of data submitted by this smallschool district to comply with chapter 1 regulations today let me share with you some of what that data is because i think it is important that you understand obviously in the application you have to show first and foremost how every dollar is projected to be spent from administration to instruction from salaries to fringe benefits to noncapital objects to purchased services and so you have to show exactly how every dollar is going to be spent then you have to articulate what the purchased services are going to be what the capital objects are that you are going to purchase with this money then you have to indicate in subject areas exactly where the impact of these dollars is going to be in other words how much is going to be allocated for every different kind of instruction from language arts to reading to integrated reading and language arts to math to prekindergarten to extended day kindergarten and so on the list goes then you have to show how many grades are going to be involved how many of those students are going to be in the public schools how many are going to be in the private schools and how much you are going to allocate in each particular area then you have to indicate what your personnel are going to be who they are going to be what their title will be exactly what percent of their fulltime equivalency will be spent on this program then you have to indicate general information about the school district such as where it is its basic administration its coordinator for the chapter 1 program et cetera on the next page you have to indicate who the targeting data would suggest to be the targeted students you have to indicate this for every school building within your local education agency indicating the grades covered in that school the enrollment those that are going to be enrolled from private schools those that are low income and that type of data then you have to explain the private school participation at that point in time you begin a needs assessment and then you have to explain exactly how the procedural steps will be taken to describe which students most need this program when that is completed you will describe the procedural steps that will be taken to specifically select students within your local education agency then you will have to go on and describe the constructional component in each particular one of these categories that is going to be used from their goals their desired outcomes and the states definition of substantial progress that is the goal in that particular area at that point you have to go on and begin to describe the basic concept or the basic description of your particular school district and each of the buildings within your school district that will be used in the activities that will be used under that at which point you begin to articulate how your evaluation plan will be carried out at that point you have to design under section 5 an instructional component design talking about what the lea performance objectives axe in each area and what definition of substantial progress will be used to calculate whether substantial progress was or was not made then you begin an evaluation plan for the next few pages literally describing in every area how you will be evaluating this particular plan with each kind of particular students that will be going on now i could carry this on to the end and i would bore you to death and folks that is only one part of the lea application"], [0.48695826530456543, 0.48695826530456543, 0, "but you never indicated he said otherwise

was based on a description by the fbi that the gun was found withthe man was found with his palms up and that gun was underneath the palm he said that was all that would have been visible was the trigger guard would i have missed seeing a gun with the dense foliage if that being the case its possible i could have missed it in other words if it was only the trigger guard and if the gun was obscured under the hand but when we put the gun in the hand in the position it was in in the picture and we rolled the hand over the butt of the gun was up or the gun was lying across the palm of the hand you could not have missed it it would have been impossible and i do not know why fiske did not check that out a blind man could see it yet everybody is accepting this report at face value saying it is a great report and forensic experts are perfect everthing else is perfect and it is so full of holes you could not put water in it it is terrible it makes me sick i do not want to upset mr fosters family i am sure that they would like this thing to go away i am sure that o j simpson the families of the people who lost their lives in the o j simpson case i am sure they would like for it to go away but you do not stop an investigation because people want it to go away especially if there are questions that are not answered you get to the bottom of it when a homicide detective goes out to investigate a site like mr fosters death scene they assume it is a homicide until they prove it is a suicide in this case they tried to do just the opposite other questions congressman rohrabacher well we have two discrepancies here we have one discrepancy when he says he doesnthe never saw the gun and the other discrepancy is that he is absolutely certain that the palms were up so thus we have two major descrepancies then we go on i said but the point is see that gun is shoved under his leg partially but you are saying the palms were definitely the confidential witness said for about the 90th time the palms were up i said and if the palms were up in that position you would have seen the gun illand he said i would have seen the gun other questions i said okay now tell us about the cabin there was a cabin there i said you said you knew the guy that owned that cabin years ago theres a cabin about 175 yards aviay from the site where they found the body he said i knew a retired navy commander who lives in that project he was going to set me up with the owner i said but there is a private road that goes back to that cabin he said there is a private road that goes right back to it from the housing development right next to it i said if somebody came back that road they wouldnt be seen he said they would not be seen period i said how far is that from the cabin he said 150 to 175 yards congressman burton so they could have walked around that and come right up he says they are dead in the woods all the way and there is a path that leads right straight up to where they found the body i do not know if somebody brought the body in that way or not i had no idea but that was something that was not investigated because when they told the fbi about it they did not even know there was a cabin back there he had to go show them then we started talking about when he left to call the police after he found the body he said i went got in my van started up the parkway because i was on the parkway i got up to where the park headquarters axe about two two and a half miles maybe a little further up the road the righthand side there is a little phone sign right there i pulled in there was a couple of vehicles on the left i had never been in there before there is two phones there i never saw thembecause i saw the guys there 11c622 co the phones sat back behind the trees over here on the right side i saw the guys there i was looking at them drove by still didnt see any phones looked both ways but apparently drove right by the phones and never saw them backed up turned around started back out was going to ask them to use the phone motioned for them to come over the younger white man walked over i asked him for a phone he stated that you know why and i says well its an emergency i need to use the phone can you get me to a phone yes but why and he says i think he said it the third time at that point i went wait a minute fine are you familiar with fort

headaches that go with possibilities of going to courts and hearings and crap that all i done was come onto a body thats all hey i done my duty im gone he went to call the police i simply drove off and i stayed quiet for approximately six months the reason he stayed quiet for 6 months was because he was afraid he found this body under mysterious circumstances and did not want to get into it now

me say that regardless of whether you are a republican a democrat or an independent you are still a citizen of a country that is running into debt at a rate of 44 million an hour now tonight we have been able to witness different ideas and different solutions or at least one different proposed solution as you can see the vote that passed that in was extremely close in the next few days you are going to see a lot of whooping and hollering and a lot of cheering about what a great victory that was but i think all of us across this country that it is incumbent upon all of us to take a look beyond the surface of the water and look and see what rests underneath it i think folks that we have an iceberg that sits ahead of us i think that this body tonight just addressed the top part of the iceberg and did not look under the water the biggest part of that iceberg as we all know lies under the water this plan that we talked about this evening it did some i obviously do not agree with the tax increases and i am going to talk about the tax increases here in a few moments but this plan is not what anguished me so much about the taxes although i am very opposed to that what they put into the plan what bothers me about the plan is what the plan did not include and what did it not include it did not include real significant budget cuts real significant cuts in spending we cannot get ahead of this problem we cannot sail around that iceberg unless we begin to cut spending first we have got to cut spending first in my opinion i think that this plan will simply hold the status quo and send in more dough simply hold the status quo to send in more dough let me take just a couple of minutes to talk about tax what is a tax first of all we all know that a tax is not creation of capital you do not create capital with a tax a tax is simply a transfer of wealth individuals and the citizens of this country go out and in fact spend the first 2 hours and 50some minutes the first 2 hours and 50some minutes of every work day of a year to pay their taxes and those taxes are a transfer they are transfers from the pockets of the working people of this country to the pockets of the government in large part what you are doing is taking money from those people who work and are giving money to those who do not when you transfer the money for example in colorado let us talk about the gasoline tax that has just been passed out of this house this evening that 4cent gasoline tax will take approximately 60 million to 80 million every year out of the pockets of the citizens of the state of colorado and where will that money go well we know one thing for certain actually two things the first thing is that the citizens of colorado will not be able to spend that money out of their pockets the second thing is that money instead of being spent in colorado will be transferred to washington dc to be filtered down through a bureaucracy now you tell me based on the record of this government based on the record of the people that have been elected to run this government in an efficient fashion who performs better the people who hold that money in their pockets and spend that money in the state of colorado or any other state in this union or the bureaucracy that we have got in washington dc who do you think can be more wise in the expenditure of that money let us talk a little more about taxation in 1948 in 1948 the average family spent 2 3 percent 2 3 percent 2 cents approximately on every dollar paying federal taxes today it is no longer 2 3 percent it is not 5 percent it is not 10 percent it is not 15 percent it is 30 percent 30 percent of the annual familys income goes just to pay federal taxation we are not talking about state taxation or local taxes just to pay your federal taxes from 2 3 or 2 cents per dollar to 30 cents per dollar and that is before this plan passed this evening the typical american famlly pays more in federal taxes than it spends on food clothing transportation insurance pensions and recreation all combined the average american will have to work 123 days of this year of every year to pay their federal state and local taxes well what do they do do we raise more revenue to my colleagues and to the citizens of this country let me tell you that the problem in this country is not a revenue problem raising the taxes is not the answer our problem in this country is a spending problem now some of the viewers tonight and excuse me some of the people in this audience you all know others that have had trouble with credit cards they overspend their credit cards they run up a debt on their credit cards that they cannot pay so they go to a financial consultant what is the first thing that that financial consultant does that financial consultant says to the person who has put too much on or run up too much credit or too much debit on that card the first thing they say is give me the credit cards we will have to cut the credit cards in half we have got to control your usage of the credit cards and we have got to put you on a payasyougo status the plan this evening does not do that the unitedstates congress is not doing that and the administration is not doing that but do not for 1 minute think that you as a family are not expected to do that the government of this country expects every family and every citizen of this country to balance their budget just try for example to run the kind of debt ratios that we run in this country and see where you end up it does not work some would say look you need to raise taxes you need to bring in more revenue because if you raise taxes you are going to reduce the deficit well let us take a look at history let us take a look at the record of this unitedstates congress and let us take a look at the record of the administration both of them combined since 1947 since 1947 for every dollar that they have raised in taxes they have spent an additional 1 59 they being the government c3 2300 for every dollar they spent an additional 1 59 there has never been a time in history where there has been a bill passedby this house and signed by the administration under the promise that it is going to reduce the deficit there has never been a bill in this country that has actually reduced the deficit based on that promise do you think tonight is going to be any different it is not i think we have asked the taxpayers for too much i think we have to introduce discipline into the congressional offices and into the administration let me say the congress of the united states we in this body we could not tax enough to keep up with the spending habits that come out of these chambers you could not tax enough to keep up with it what do we do we need to look at that spending as i mentioned and mentioned and mentioned are there ways to cut the spending ways to get to that yes and i think we need to start here in our own chambers i think the unitedstates congress should immediately invoke a 25percent cut in congressional staffs some people are going to tell you that is not going to work it puts too much of a burden on the members that we cannot handle our constituent contacts let me sayand i am not boasting but just to give you an example and just to set an example in front of all of youi have one of the largest congressional districts in the united states it is one of the toughest congressional districts in the united states to travel we operate our office with more than a 25percent cut in staff it can be done and congress needs to step forward and do it immediately our congressional staff is 10 times the size of the next closest country now the reduction in congressional staff is it a big drop in the bucket as compared to the overall deficit the answer to that of course is no but symbolically it shows we are willing to step forward and cut spending first we have other solutions that we can take a look at i think we need to look at a model put forward by some of the states for example in the state of coloradowhy do i bring up colorado of course i am from colorado and i have worked in the state government in colorado i have worked in the state government in colorado and i am aware of how they control their budget in colorado there is a constitutional amendment that you cannot spend more money than you bring in that is called a balanced budget colorado also has a lineitem veto colorado has term limitations let us talk can we at the federal level can we have a concept of a budget is there a way without increasing taxes to cut spending the answer to that is yes do you know that if we took the amount of money this year the amount of money that the unitedstates congress is spending this year and we did not spend any additional funds next year in other words we took that hottomline figure let us say it was 10 then we said to the american people we are not going to cut one penny in spending in fact all we are going to do is to ask that the federal government not spend any more money next year than they spend this year in other words if they spent 10 this year we are not going to ask them to spend 9 next year we are going to ask them to just keep the expenditures next year at the same level what would be the result the result is that we would balance the budget the annual deficit by the year 1998 why is that because do you remember when i said earlier revenue was not our problem in this country in the last 10 years the revenues to our country have doubled it is the expenses which have skyrocketed if we could control the expenses and if the revenue continues to grow even at the rate of 1 percent we couldkbalance the annual budget by the year 1997 that is going to require a lot of tough decisions but i think the people of america are demanding of the unitedstates congress and of the administration that we make some tough decisions i think for the first time in a long time the america people as a whole are willing to make the kind of sacrifices that are necessary tocontinue the greatness of this country and the economic model that this country has set forth in the free world let me say that we have got to have discipline one of the ways that we can do discipline is that we can take away the very incentives which give congressional people the motivation to look out for their selfinterest instead of the interests of the country and that is term limitations i have never been more convinced of the need for term limitations than in my few short months here in the united states congress we have term limitations in the state of colorado the state of colorado has term limitations the state of washington has term limitations let me say to all of you that it will work we need term limitations in the united states congress we need to reform congress we need to say that if congress has a bill if congress introduces a bill that amendments to that bill have to fit under the title what does that mean let me give you an example not long ago we had the flood relief bill the good lord knows many people in the midwest suffered horrible tragedy it is the responsibility of every citizen and a responsibility that every citizen in this country has accepted to step forward and help the victims in the midwest of those floods so a bill in excess of 3 billion now 5 billion bill has been put together to assist these people but do you know what happened when that bill got to the house floor to these chambers there was an amendment put on that that had absolutely absolutely nothing to do with the flood disaster in the midwest it rode on the coattails of tragedy and allotted funds for a program in los angeles ca thank goodness that program that bad amendment was stripped on the senate side but it is not right for the people to be able to put an amendment under a bill that has nothing to do with the bill in colorado you cannot do that in colorado we have the sunshine act all meetings have to be held in the open if we could get some basic reform not reform that penalizes congress not reform that penalizes the administration or penalizes the republicans or penalizes the democrats but basic wholesome reform we can bring this congress back to the respect level that it needs to be and we can i know we can cut the spending and take care of the deficit which is crippling this country at this point let me continue and just say that in regard to a couple of other issues that i think we have got to address one of them is entitlement programs let me show you this book right here it is just entitlement programs take a look at that just entitlement programs i can say that the plan that we just voted on a few hours ago does not eliminate one federal program not one to my colleagues our program is we got too many people riding the wagon we do not have enough people pulling the wagon we need to streamline our federal agencies we need to take a look at illegal immigration i read an editorial not long ago in the rifle newspaper in rifle co we have hud housing we have a real housing shortage in colorado in western colorado and in that particular editorial they pointed out how the local hud officials are prohibited prohibited from asking or determining what an applicants citizenship status is they cannot ask somebody if they are a citizen of the united states before they lease them governmentsubsidized housing what about the americans what about the americans first we need to take care of this country our country became great by offering a home for fnany immigrants but we have to have some kind of guideline on the illegalimmigration facing this country it is a drain on our deficit we have other programs we need to look at the porkbarrel programs i mean the tree planting program in the small business administration the point i am coming back to is that regardless of whether you are a republican unaffiliated a democrat take a look at the history of this coun try take a look at the last 10 years i do not mean to be repetitive but these points are so important look at the last 10 years it is a revenue problem we have got more money than we have had in our history coming into the coffers of the unitedstates government it is a spending problem take a look at what this government is doing our forefathers never imagined never imagined the kind of programs that our government would be sponsoring and paying for and we know that a lot of programs are good programs and in my opinion we have plenty of resources in this country to take care of the truly needy but ye have to have enough guts to stand up h6280 c to the people who do not need those proceeds who do not need that kind of assistance and take them off the program we have to have enough guts to stand up and say that we need welfare reform in this country we have got to have enough guts to stand up and say to people on welfare that are able to work you are going to go to work we have to have enough guts to say to the people on welfare that you are going to go to school you are going to learn you are going to be a contributor not a drain to society but a contributor to society we have to be able to stand up and have enough guts to take a look at those parents who are not paying child support and say you are going to pay the child support or the penalty is going to be very severe the government is not going to continue to subsidize the children that you have a legal responsibility to do let me conclude by reading a quotation that i think says it very well you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage maker you cannot further the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred you cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn you cannot build character and courage by taking away a mans nitiative and independence you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could do and should do for themselves about 3 weeks ago i had a rancher come up we were talking about the spending problems in this country and the tax and whether tax was the right answer he and i both agreed that you do not tax tax is not the answer you need to introduce discipline in this process his concluding remarks to me will be my concluding remarks to you before you put any more water in the bucket plug the holes"], [0.48710858821868896, 0.48710858821868896, 0, "i thank the gentleman from california and appreciate the opportunity to participate in this special order b t collins was truly an unusual individual he would be classified as an example of a living legend he would not have appreciated hearing that probably but i have never met anybody like him and i think most people felt that way b t actually i first met when he was as has been mentioned was governor browns chief of staff and he was a republican even then actually b t opposed me as i recall my first three elections but he did not know me all that well and he eventually came around and supported me very staunchly particularly beginning with the 1990 election when there was a very controversial tough issue that came up and he jumped right to my defense i am not here tonight because he either opposed or supported me simply to observe that b t collins was a straighttalking man if he told you something you could count on it and he was one of the few individuals i have ever known that actually whatever he said he would do he always did that and then some i think that was respected very much about him i had the privilege of attending just a wonderful service that was quite a lengthy one but actually every speaker there had something valuable to say it went on for abut 2 hours it was the memorial service right near the vietnam veterans memorial that he actually brought into being through his perseverance an outstanding memorial thatwould be if we had nothing here in washington i think would make it seem to pale by comparison i am always proud of it when i see it and i realize it was through his efforts obviously these things are a team effort but b t took the lead and went to many people and i say this personally and solicited contributions and really made it happen it was so unusual to me it is one thing to lend your name to an effort but b t went well beyond that he actually personally took charge and went down the list and called people and buttonholed them and collected those contributions many times i would see him around the district not just the sacramento area there too but he never represented for example nevada county and yet i would see him when they had the annual republican barbecue b t collins had driven up to the fairgrounds in grass valley to give a talk and share his thoughts with the people they loved him and as i would watch him climb into his car i thought how difficult well that is difficult frequently going beyond your area to speak taking time away from other priorities but i thought here was b t collins severely injured in the war and frankly i think never without pain not that he ever showed any sign of that but i am given to understand through the remarks that were made that he was almost in constant paizi and yet he never revealed never complained about it always giving and realizing that i think about him climbing into his car and tired at the end of a sunday afternoon where he had given a speech in nevada county quite distant from where his focus of activities would have been when i think of b t collins i think of the following terms heart b t collins was a man with heart he understood people he loved people and he did everything he could to try and improve peoples circumstances loyalty fiercely loyal to whomever his superior officer was i mean i saw that loyalty clearly first for governor brown and then to tom hayes the state treasurer and then to governor wilson b t collins sat in my office it was wednesday i guess and told me he had no interest in running for the state assembly and the following tuesday he declared he declared because the man to whom he was loyal whom he served the governor of california asked him to run and for b t collins anybody knows running a political campaign is a major undertaking he gave up a job that paid him pretty well and instead went into the political fray once again and he did it out of a sense of loyalty made a lot of sacrifice service b t collins believed in public service he was i think the premier exemplar of that the gentleman from california referenced his accomplishments in taking the ccc and really giving it form and definition and inspiring young people to want to serve in that body he really personifled the california conservation corps always felt proud i think of that assoclation i have mentioned before b t collins was a man of action he was a good talker never forget his talk but he was a man of action and as the gentleman listed in his accomplishments he was out there always doing things in lieu of flowers we have been invited to send contributions to the weve center woman escaping a violent environment so even there in death he was out there active raising funds for the causes that he believed in i just want to mention briefly i saw him various times at the eagle scout courts of honor and it was always interesting to listen to him speak i do not think i ever saw him speak with notes he always just spoke straight to the audience came right from the heart and it was always interesting and frequently memorable the things that he had to say reference has been made to the notes and he also called people on their birthdays in fact i was surprised i got a telephone call it is just so unusual that people are able to make the time to do hat kind of thing and as irony would have it i had gone through a file which i was overdue in looking at of correspondence sent to me and i pulled out two notes from b t collins to me and i took them home to show julie but as fate would have it he passed away before i had that opportunity to do that and so when i came back from the funeral last week i pulled those notes out and showed her along with the program of his memorial service and b t collins attending the memorial service by the way it was really kind of the outpouring of support you would find almost for a deceased president i commented upon that i have never seen during my time at the scene there in the state capital an outtouring of support like we had for b t collins it was truly remarkable he was an outstanding individual i think he always will have left an impression upon my mind of someone who truly through his actions performed the acts of christian service i am very very pleased to be here this evening to join in this special order commending b t collins i think his relatives and friends can be very proud of him and the life that he led and i for one shall have longstanding fond memories of this fine dedicated public servant"], [0.48722898960113525, 0.48722898960113525, 0, "i very much thank the gentleman from north carolina for his leadership as my colleagues know one of the frustrating things to me that i have felt keenly for the past several months is we hear speeches by the president and members of his administration telling us we all need to have shared sacrifice and i do not necessarily disagree with that ultimately i think we all as the american people are going to have to pull together and do what it takes to put our republic once again on a firm fiscal footing i guess what so deeply troubles me is that the rhetoric of shared sacrifice is always directed to the sacrifice of the american taxpayer and never to the sacrifice of the government the government does not need to sacrifice what those individuals claim in fact the role of government is so important that far from sacrificing it needs to be augmented it needs to be expanded and for that purpose vast new tax increases on the middle class and on everyone are being proposed in order to fund an expanded government government needs to go on a diet like most americans i suppose we all could benefit from shedding a few pounds and the government needs to shed a few pounds that is a few expenditures it is presently making the gentleman from north carolina has taken leadership in trying to have us do just that beginning with the branch that we most are directly associated with the legislative branch i was not here for the beginning of this special order but i very much join in the remarks of the gentleman from florida i mean it is absurd that we have in essence unlimited funds being provided to three former speakers of the house to wind up their affairs this is not to denigrate these men who have served but if weare going to identify areas where economies can be made in my opinion this expenditure never should have been made in the first place but now that we have got it we should certainly terminate it and that is just as my colleagues know one little area the republican leaders plan which i endorse and this was a plan indicating how the world would be different in terms of running the house of representatives if the republicans ever ran it but that plan calls for a 50percent reduction in the staffs on the committees i am very concerned about big government as i think most americans are the bigger the government gets the more laws and regulations we have to have in order to justify all of its employees we see this very clearly in fact the gentleman from north carolina the sponsor of this special order today has wisely coauthored a bill which i am very proud to be a cosponsor of that goes directly to the heart of that issue by requiring that before any administrative regulation proposed by an administrative agency can take effect it must be actually voted upon here in the congress of the united states believe me that would do more than just about any other practical thing we could do to reduce substantially the promotion or the promulgation of new regulations we are after all the legislative body of the country created by the founders and the drafters of the unitedstates constitution but in practical effect today for years we have been passing very broad laws and leaving the details to someone else that is the administrative agencies as someone once said the devil is in the details it really is that is where the specifics actually are provided that institute the new burdens on businesses and individuals so you khow i commend the gentleman from north carolina for that effort as we debate this bill or concept that the gentleman bag discussed that would reduce the expenditures of the legislative branch of government i think it is very appropriate i am convinced we would not only see no reduction in the quality of legislation if we cut these committee staffs by 50 percent i would represent that the more staff we reduce overall in the house of representatives and the senate to a certain level the more we reduce the better the quality of the legislative product because all of a sudden the men and women elected by the people of the united states to come here and serve would give more of their personal attention to these issues if they cannot read the thousandpage bill if they cannot be bothered with the details then there will not be any bill that is the approach we need to be taking we need as representatives of the people to be able to digest it to understand it and to act upon it rather than simply just kind of putting it on automatic pilot and letting it go out to the administrative agencies the size of this legislative budget and the staff that this budget supports is what makes all of those things possible so the gentleman from north carolina by proposing these reductions is not only saving the taxpayers money which is vital in this time of fiscal crisis but he is also going to be giving us better government more effective government more bang for the buck sure we want certain things taken care of by government well let us see that they are taken care of let us get a healthier economy let us increase job opportunities let us increase opportunities for people to better themselves financially in order to do that we have to have smaller government in order to do that why we have to take some of these measures being advocated by the gentleman from north carolina so i am very pleased to be here today and join in this special order and thank the gentleman for the opportunity"], [0.4872484803199768, 0.4872484803199768, 0, "i rise to explain both personally and for the record to my colleagues what i believe to be gross deficiencies in the bill that is running through this congress and is expected to be on the presidents desk within the next 2 weeks and that is the bill intended to make it easier to register to vote and which is commonly known as the motorvoter bill it was called the motorvoter bill because it allows people to register to vote when they go to get their drivers licenses and that was the original concept it has been bandied around this congress for many years it has not successfully made it all the way through although in the last couple of years it did get to the presidents desk and he vetoed it but we have a new administration and it is expected to pass it is expected to pass the other body it is expected to pass here it is expected to go to president clinton and it is expected that he will sign it and that it will come into law if it comes into law if it becomes law there are such gross deficiencies with this bill that i predict to my colleagues that this program once enacted is going to present more headaches for the various agency heads federal state and local for the federal election commission for the justice department at the federal level for the state secretaries of state for the registrars of voters for the county and in louisiana parish representatives for the precinct leaders it is going to be mindboggling because they do not even begin to know how many regulations and how many hoops that they have to jump through in order to comply with this terribly onerous bill without any money to provide them that compliance that is this bill provides no money at all it just gives them a lot of things that they must do a lot of mandates when president clinton spoke in his inaugural address about change he said he was going to reinvent america now most americans though did not know that he meant to change by fiat the very nature of american culture and the very essence of what it means to be an american when it is not president clinton ignoring the nations top military advisers and destroying troop cohesiveness and discipline by forcing open homosexuality on the military then it is president clintons liberal democratic allies in congress cheapening the very basis of american democracy through the right and privilege of citizens to vote the tyrannical majority of the other party in this body seems determined to give the vote to people who are not even american citizens for purely partisan political purposes i suppose the first instance editorialized against even by the liberal new york times occurred when delegates of unitedstates territories representing samoans and guam residents and others who do not even pay american taxes and who in some instances are not even american citizens were given the right to vote on this house floor equal to the vote of the representatives of the real american states fortyseven thousand samoans now have the same representation in congress that 800 000 real americans from montana have or 630 000 people in the first congressional district of louisiana the district that i represent that is a bastardization of democracy and i call it alien vote no 1 but now we have another problem and here is the point i have been building to now they are going one step further under the guise of voting rights they want to make it easier to do the great wrong of giving illegal aliens greater opportunity to vote in every american election through this motorvoter bill making its way through congress now one provision of the motorvoter bill would force states to accept what we call same day registration that is that you register and you vote on the same day based only oi the requirement that you have a drivers license well as everybody knows the single easiest piece of identification for an illegal alien or for anybody else to obtain is a drivers license you sail in from haiti finagle a drivers license and vote even though you are an illegal alien sneak in from mexico finagle a drivers license and vote even though you are an illegal alien drop in from anywhere finagle a drivers license and vote even if especially you are an illegal alien who will vote with one party presumably because they are pushing it the democrat party now while you are at it use your voting card to qualify for welfare bene fits paid for by the american taxpayer whose votes against high taxes and big government are effectively canceled out by your illegal vote the only way the tyrannical majority can force this injustice is by trampling the unitedstates constitution and legitimate state prerogatives and that is what they do with this bill james madison in federalist paper no 10 the single greatest explication of american political theory warns directly against the tyranny of such a majority i quote mr madison when he said when a majority is included in a faction then the very form of popular government enables that majority to sacrifice to its ruling passionary interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens i submit to you that in the democratic majority which has controlled congress for these last many years close to 50 years a faction has developed which is so interested in maintaining its own power that it is trampling the constitution trampling on the principle of federalism trampling upon the very notion of american citizenship to accomplish its own political ends motorvoter means forced voter registration at the welfare offices at the unemployment offices at the drivers license bureau it rieans an inability to purge the people who are dead who cannot vote or who have not voted in 4 or 10 or 100 years it means eliminating the possibility that people would be taken off the rolls if they are simply not voting it means an open invitation to vote fraud by prohibiting notarization of identification papers and other antifraud devices that states have implemented over the years to make sure that the right people are registered the right people vote but that the wrong people cannot it prohibits that this motorvoter autofraudo democracy for the dead law could well mean that high election day turnout by illegal aliens exercising the citizenship rights which middle america does not even realize are slipping inexorably away i think that is a tragedy now i would like to examine in detail the provisions of the motorvoter bill so that my colleagues will understand we are going to go through this debate next week and my colleagues need to understand the deficiencies of this bill first of all it is not just a motorvoter bill it does not just provide for registration at the drivers license bureau that is just one thing we can already register if we want to at our election board whatever the state or the precinct or the county calls it there is a secretary of state there is a commissioner for elections there is all these officials entrusted with registering people who want to register and who want to vote the process is there but we are going to duplicate that process by putting it in the drivers license bureau moreover we are going to put it into the welfare offices and we are going to put it into the unemployment offices this bill would require those offices to provide registration so in addition to the duties that they already have they have got to provide registration services which means that the little money that they have to run their own shows has to be stretched out and they have to become miniregistrars of voters in addition to what they already do remember with no extra federal money to pay the bill now it is our position that these ideas first of all promote an inoperable bureaucracy the thing cannot work but even if it did work it pro motes fraud at the polls it allows people who should not vote to vote if they want to for example it provides for mail registration which prohibits verification you want to send in a postcard say i want to be registerd on a postcard you want to do it over here and then change your name a little bit and do it over there in the next neighborhood or in the next town next precinct go ahead mail in a card and see where you go so conceivably you could mail in cards from every little borough in new york or every little ward or precinct in louisiana or california and a single person could be registered to vote 5 6 10 100 times if he is a very ingenious person some folks say well they are not going to do that there is no such thing as voter fraud folks the guy that beat me in 1976 went to prison in 1977 for voter fraud i think that history is replete with evidence in this country that voter fraud exists and people want to take advantage of the political process for their own purposes and the worst thing you could do is make the processes available to them yet this bill the motorvoter bill does exactly that it makes it available to them to pervert to pervert the political process for their own puposes it provides for mail registration as i have indicated without verification that the person is who he says he is it provides for registration at the welfare offices meaning that applicants who go for welfare benefits will probably be intimidated and certainly not say anything like well i am an illegal alien and even though i want welfare benefits i am really an illegal alien and i shouldnt vote that is not likely what is likely is that an illegal alien goes in for welfare benefits and signs up to vote too so why not he is here it also provides for sameday registration in fact it encourages sameday registration there are lots of costs attendant to the rest of this bill it is a prohibitively costly bill we will get to that later on but this bill says you do not have to change your laws you do not have to change to go to all the expense of this bill just have sameday registration and frankly what that simply means is you walk in you say look here i am i am ready to vote here is my drivers license let me vote and they let you vote and they register you and you vote all at the same time if you want to do that in 1 precinct in a 2d precinct in the 3d precinct in a 4th precinct and a 5th precinct and a 10th precinct and the 60th precinct you can keep on doing it members that is voter fraud that demeans the vote of each and every american citizen who is rightfully entitled to one vote and one vote only well what else does this bill do it is h r 2 rushing through congress that is the number of the bill the motorvoter bill it is conducive to automatic enrollment of ineligibles we have talked about that ineligibles being people who should not vote since they are voting at the drivers license bureau in some instances in my state you can get a drivers license at 15 at 16 at 17 years of age you are not supposed to vote though you are supposed to only vote from the time that you are 18 years of age or older if a kid wanted to take advantage of it and go ahead and vote chances are that he would be able to under this statute an illegal alien zoe bairds chauffeur what have we heard the most about over the last week the attorney generaldesignate sent in nominated by the president of the united states had to withdraw from her nomination because she had hired illegal aliens one of them was her chauffeur he had a drivers license under this law zoe bairds chauffeur would be entitled to vote unless he said to the drivers license bureau no i cant vote because i am an illegal alien how likely is that not very what we have is a bill that provides that you will be registered unless you say you do not want to that is a unique provision here there is not a state in the union that currently says you will be registered unless you say you dont want to but under the provisions of this bill when you sign your drivers license there is a form on the bottom of the drivers license application that says to the effect that yes i want to be registered to vote or you actually have to sign your name and say no i dont want to be registered to vote you do not have an election unless you sign no i dont want to be registered to vote you are going to be registered again how likely is it that an illegal alien is going to say wait i cant vote because i am an illegal alien again not likely as to sameday registration the justice department has come our very very strongly about that they have said that sameday registration would greatly impair the ability of the department and the state to combat voting and election fraud and would totally preclude meaningful verification of voter eligibility thus allow easy corruption of the election process by the unscrupulous that is from the justice department in a letter to the chairman of the senate committee on rules and administration last year the attorney general i suppose said of all the registration reforms which congress has covered over the recent years from a law enforcement perspective this idea is far the most troubling in fact talking about mailin registration the postcard registration in 1982 a new york grand jury reviewed widespread voter fraud charges in kings county from 1968 to 1982 and observed and i quote the advent of mailin registration in 1976 made the creation of bogus registration cards even easier and less subject to detection according to the testimony mailin registration has become the principal means of perpetrating election fraud and has apparently resulted in the abandonment of a pre1976 election fraud method well all this says is in effect election fraud is made easy pure and simple here is how to do it and we are going to make it as easy on you as possible cheat the system and make sure that people get elected who do not deserve to be elected to me that is frightening i yield to the gentleman from illinois"]], "top_incorrect":

parliamentary inquiry because i was wondering whether logic would be allowed in this debate iam assuming it will be allowed but not highly valued because the argument somehow put forward is that families are being undermined by what the district of columbia did and even by thie somewhat strained logical standards i am prepared to apply from time to time in this house i cannot understand how that is supposed to work what the district of columbia has said is if two people who are living together want to register as domestic partners they can do so and we are told that this will undermine the family now many of the people who will be taking advantage of this as the gentlewoman from washington has pointed out will be people who are in no particular loving relationship of a sexual sort but what has clearly rolled some of the members here is that some of the people who will take advantage of this will be gay or lesbian couples and that i gather is how this is supposed to undermine the family i have to tell you that i do not understand for the life of me how the fact that i will go home tonight and have dinner with herb undermines anybody elses family i do not begin to understand the logic i understand there are people who are so motivated by anger toward others that they are resentful that other people might find some happiness and they consider it their mission in life to interfere with the happiness of others solely for that purpose but to argue that this somehow undermines their families has no logical basis the only thing i can think of is that they were very impressed at an early age by the v8 commercial you remember the v8 commercial you remember the commercial where the guy is drinking a tomato juice drinking stringbean juice and he is drinking whatever else and then someone gives him a v4 and he says by god i could have had a v8 apiparently the analogs are happily married heterosexuals all over washington dc indeed all over america and they learned that in washington dc herb and i could register as domestic partners and these happily married people say god i could have married a guy i mean are we really the v8 of america is the attractive power of the way i live my life so great that you fear that happily married couples will somehow dissolve their bonds ignore their children and come knock at our doors that is of course nonsense even by the standards that some of the nonsense purveyors of this place specialize in and it makes it very clear we are not talking about undermining a family no one thinks that the recognition by the district of columbia of the right of two men who love each other or two women who love each other to try to be responsible and share each others lives responsibly that that undermines anybodys family it does not undermine my family or herbs family we coexist very happily with our family but i do not understand the logic what is it about the fact that a couple of people have found happiness that so offends you what is it that drives you to try to make political capital by inflicting misery on other people what is it that says we have a duty to interfere with the lives of others the gentleman from california made a reasonable proposal the gentleman from californias proposal says all right there will not be any federal money and by the way i hope on will tell me under oath that they are doing this tosave money because we are going to have a unitedstates attorney in here making an arrest no one thinks this is about money this is about angei at other peoples way of living with this phony argument that somehow it is going to undermine the family what we are talking about is an amendment by the gentleman from california that says ok no federal money let the district of columbia make its own decisions and what we have is a majority of members apparently that they hope are going to say no the district of columbia cannot recognize that two men or two women might find comfort in each other and might want to share each others lives and we are so offended by that that we are going to ban it we are going to prevent it we are going to forbid it under some pretext and again i would be delighted if someone later in this debate would explain to me how that undermines the family how does it destroy the family if it is not the power of attraction what is it what is it that would take a happy marriage between a man and a woman and as a matter of fact by the way the attractive power of this particular v8 must be extraordinary because no one is talking about anything that meets the benefits of marriage we are not talking about the tax benefits of marriage we are not talking about a whole range of other things married couples can do we are talking about some minimalist situation in which people might be able to grant health benefits together let us be very clear what we are talking about we are talking about a combination of some people whose primary motivati6n is dislike to the point of irrationality of other human beings and who have decided to use the elevated position of a member of the greatest legislative body in the world and the greatest democracy in the worldand i mean to include the senate in that comparisonthese are people who want to use that elevated position simply to make some other peoples lives miserable because they do not approve of their lives that is what we are talking about this is an effort to impose a punishment on other people this is not a case about money and there is not even a rational beginning about how family that has historically been mr frank of massachusetts how we offend families recognized in our society does it undermine other families"], [0.5127284228801727, 0.48727157711982727, 1, "madam chairman i thank the gentleman from missouri for yielding this time to me and i especially thank the gentleman from missouri for standing by me for 8 years and as we bring this bill one more time to the floor madam chairman i really want to say this is a good day because i think we finally are going to see it move from rhetoric to reality for people who are really going to have something today when we finally finish this we are going to find out who is for families and who is just faking my colleagues having been around for 8 years and having listened to all this debate about what is legislative history and on and on and on i feel that for 8 years we have been talking past each other on some very critical items in this legislation that the critics get up and say the same thing over and over again and they never listen to the answers that we continue to give them madam chairman we constantly hear if you pass this bill its going to hurt americas competitiveness well i want to know what is different about americas families my colleagues if the japanese and germans who are knocking our socks off in international trade do much more than this bill ever would why is our doing a little bit of something even though it is less than what they do for our families going to mean we never can compete again i do not believe it then we hear it is going to hurt small business well over and over again we say please look groups under 50 or businesses under 50 employees are not covered then we hear it is going to cost too much well the gentleman from new york just gave a fantastic statement about that and over and over again it has been shown that the cost of retraining new employees is much greater to an employer than the cost of retaining people through family leave that the cost estimate on this is 6 per employee per year now if we do not care that much about americas families we are in trouble the new one i love is that this discriminates against women right that is why i have been pushing it i really want to get all women out of the workplace come on again every single other industrial country has done this and they have not found that it discriminated against women and so i do not think we are going to find out it does that here either so madam chairman one more time when we look at this body and see 80 percent of the elected women backing this i do not think any of them are backing it because they are out to discriminate against women and i hope just once our critic would listen we also have people standing up against this because they want people to have the flexibility to design the benefit package they can get well that is wonderful except that employers are not giving it flexibility we have listened to testimony upon testimony upon testimony of people who would love that flexibility but have never been given that flexibility and we know the horror stories madam chairman in the workplace we have never established a familyfriendly standard and we have never recognized anyones caregiver role in the workplace the answer is always if you are a oaregiver you shouldnt be in the workplace you should be able to afford somebody full time to stay home in other words get a wife i mean i would like a wife i think most of the congresswomen would like a wife my husband would like a wife we are going to get one so let us get real about that and let us realize that we do have to be both caregivers and good employees if every other country can get it we can get it then finally we hear what i really love the people say that because it is unpaid all of a sudden there becomes this great compassion for the poor now i would believe this a whole lot more if they were offering to pay it i would love to have it paid but we figure this should be in the area of a labor standard and not a benefit because indeed at the federal level we have never legislated benefits so this is a labor standard which means it is a de minimis floor the lowest possible floor that we do not want people to fall though therefore it is unpaid unpaid leave for a handful of weeks for some of the most critical things people can go through the birth of a baby where it is so important that bonding take place the adoption of a baby and adoption agencies will not even let someone apply for an adoption if they oannot stay home with the child for a while and get to know it because they know they do not bond when they are picked up at the agency it takes a little more time we also see it for the critical illnesses that all of us are going to have to face at some time with a spouse or with a parent or with a child i madam chairman i just do not understand why we did not pass this ages ago i now realize that children who were born the year i introduced this are in third grade it is time we pass it it is time we make it the law and i really look forward to it madam chairman again i thank all my colleagues for their help"], [0.512537807226181,

partee had the greatest sense of insight into politics and politicians he used to say to me durbin every time a politician makes a decision there is a good reason and a real reason listen to the speeches here today we have heard a lot of talk about how important an issue crime is for america i think it is one of the most important i am looking up in the gallery here at hundreds of people who have journeyed to our nations capital who have thought at some moment while they were sitting there or dcuring the course of their vacation or trip about a concern they might have about whether they or some member of their family might be a victim of crime in this city or some other city we are all sensitized to it it gets dark outside you get a little worried you worry about your daughter living in the city of chicago and how safe she will be at night it goes on across america not just in washington or chicago but in my hometown of springfield il and in every hometown represented in the gallery so you think to yourself if this problem is so important and the american people are so concerned about it why did congress get so tied in knots over it this seems pretty simple we know what we want we want more cops out there to protect our families people who commit crimes should go to jail and those who commit violent crimes should stay there we have to give the police the resources they need give the prosecutors the resources they need build the prisons if we need them i think most people would also agree we need to try to grab these kids before they turn to drugs before they turn to violence before they turin to gang activity and try just try to put them on the straight and narrow are we going to fail you bet we are but we ought to try because we know the expense of failure the expense of a life of crime not only in the wasted lives of the criminals but what it costs us as taxpayers you know this all seems pretty simple it seems like the abcs of crime and you wonder how did congress get in such a man or woman dressed in the uniform mess the policeman who put the badge on let me go back to my friend cecil this morning and put his life on the partee we have heard a lot of good line to protect me and my family reasons why people oppose this bill when it comes to issues of crime i do the real reason the rule lost a week not care how big a political action ago was over the issue of assault weap committee the gun lobby has i do not onsand over the strength of one major care how many free bumper stickers lobby group the gun lobby here in they give out to intimidate members of washington had the gun lobby in congress i think we have a moral rewashington released their votes and sponsibility to stick with the police to given members of congress a green stick with the deputies to stick with light we would have passed the rule the men and women who put their lives and the crime bill gone home and said on the line i am not an expert on at least we are trying we are listening crime the real experts are the people and we are trying but the gun lobby on the street protecting us and that is put the pressure on and as a con why today i am going to be voting for sequence many members of the house the rule against monique the brewsaid no we cant vote for the rule sterhunter crime bill put together by and that was the end of it so today we the national rifle association and i have another reprise we have another will be voting for the real crime bill it goaround on the same issue guess is a good one it strikes a balance it is what the players are the same the tough but it puts prevention funds in people who come here and say we there too want a strippeddown bill no pork the toughest cops in my district lets get down to basics vote for the when i sit down with them tell me brewsterhunter bill i want to give a what i said earlier tougher sentenclittle insight for those who are trying ing put them in prisons give us the reto follow this program and wonder sources and then they say congresswhat the players are really saying man that isnt enough weve got to the national rifle association and step into the lives of these young peothe gun lobby support the brewster ple before they go wrong and try to hunter bill because it strips out the as help try with the drug rehab try sault weapons ban this is their last with the activities for youth who gasp their last chance they are put might go astray that is a balanced apting all the money on the line they proach that is a tough but sensible apmay win it i hope they do not i am proach going to vote against them because after you take a look at that brewster hunter bill it reminds me of what my announcement by the speaker favorite governor in the united states pro tempore ann richards of texas once said about another issue she said you can take the speaker pro tempore mr a hog you can put lipstick on it and fields of louisiana the chair recall it monique but its still a pig minds persons in the gallery again that when you take a look at the brewster they are visitors of the house and any hunter bill you can call it whatever manifestations showing approval or you want streamlined no pork get se disapproval of the proceedings on the rious and so forth it i s the national floor are contrary to house rules rifle associations bill removing the assault weapons ban it is monique and we all know it support the crime bill so i hope when this is all over that the speaker pro tempore under a we not only do the right thing on crime previous order of the house the genbut that we also say to the gun lobby tleman from connecticut what has happened to you folks is recognized for 5 minutes there was a time in the history of the mr shays i have met national rifle association when they some of the finest men and women i worked as tight as could be with police have ever met anywhere who serves in groups they used to agree they would this house and i say that sometimes to come together to congress and say we people back in my district and they have sportsmen and hunters who are say youve gotto be kidding i love responsible safe people they love being a member of congress i love the their law enforcement people and want opportunity i have to serve the people to work with them and they would of the fourth congressional district come with a program and congress and i truly have incredible respect for would embrace it and there would not my colleagues on both sides of the be any debate but over the years aisle things started to separate the police i know we are very tired i feel in groups started moving in this direction some cases some harsh feelings are exand the gun lobby started moving in pressed because no one likes to be the other i caught in the position where if they this congressman has decided that vote against a crime bill it is viewed when it comes to a problem in my that they are not wanting to be tough neighborhood and my family when i on crime there is that political axiom wpick up the phone and dial 911 i am that says that controversy is the sot lookini for a national rifle asso enemy of the incumbent that somehow a ion iobbyist i am oolking fo that if you stir things up you get people angry on both sides and then you lose out there is no question there is a lot of controversy i know that members who voted for the rule are being criticized i know members who voted against the rule are being criticized i know we went back to our districts and explained why we did what we did and now we are kind of not boxed in but certainly have staked out our position so now we have to explain what we did last week and now what we do this week we all have the same incredible feelings we are getting people speaking to us from both sides on that issue but i am troubled by a number of things we are going to be criticized if people think there is pork in the bill and we are going to be criticized if people think this is a crime bill and we did not vote for it there is just going to be criticism that way but when i look at what happened last week i know that spending went up in the conference report from 2718 to 33 5 billion but it was not because of any increase in prevention funds it was because we went from 3 4 billion to 8 8 billion in putting more cops on the street i have to tell members i represent a district that knows that the best way to deal with crime in my judgment is to deal with law enforcement to have more prisons and also to have preventive programs there were a group of members on both sides of the aisle who tried to see if we could make this bill a better bill i think they have succeeded they brought the bottom line of the spending from 33 billion down to 30 billion they have brought it down below the level of the trust funds it is more responsible fiscally we have cut one third from the enforcement side which is three quarters of the budget they have cut two thirds from the part that is prevention which is one fourth of the budget we have a situation here where my colleagues on my side of the aisle have rightfully asked for changes and democrats have made those changes we have taken 13 of the categorical grants some grants that people have a difficult timewith and we have combined them into one program so people in the districts can decide what program they want the bottom line for me is that i believe this is a bill that has as many republican fingerprints as democraticfingerprints and i know it is a bill that we all have to compromise on i believe in a full life sentence i do not believe in the death penalty but i am not going to vote against a good bill that includes the death penalty i hope in the end when we vote on this bill we simply vote our conscience and go back out to our districts and explain our vote one thing to the democratic side my colleagues on that siftof the aisle had a situation where they could have gone their own way but would have had to take the assault weapons from it and they have worked with the republicans to keep the assault weapon ban in and had to compromise and had to compromise maybe more than they wanted to but i think if my colleagues will look at the bill they will see that it is a better bill with those compromises if members are unhappy with their leadership and what they have done recognize it was an attempt to keep the assault weapon ban in let us face it the vote last week really centered on that whole issue i hope we get out a strong bill which has the preventive side which my district needs particularly the urban areas and i hope we vote out this bill which provides an increase for prisons of 9 9 billion because it is all real money that still has for enforcement 13 4 billion i hope we vote out this bill and do it today"], [0.5117763578891754, 0.4882236421108246, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding the time i would like to have the attention of my distinguished colleague from new york because i did listen to every word that my colleague uttered this evening there are a number of remarks that the gentleman made that i would like to respond to but time does not permit let me go to the salient issue first let me raise this rhetorical question how many times i would ask my colleagues have we been asked to vote against rules that waive points of brder how many times more times than i can count it sets history on its head it takes me aback it is shocking to me to hear tonight on the floor of this body that the gentleman is asking us to oppose a rule that does not waive all points of order we cannot walk both sides of the street simultaneously unless your legs are pretty wide open and when they are you stand pretty vulnerable the gentleman from new york is my good friend and i respect him he says one person can rise to raise a point of order i do not stand here in the capacity of one person this is not an ego trip this is no personal issue i stand here as the chairperson of the authorizing committee charged with a responsibility it sets history on its head when you argue to sanction violations of a process that the gentleman from new york and i have already marched into the well on numerous occasions to defend that the integrity of the process must be maintained let us come specifically to the carrier let me say something to my colleague we asked for a point of order to be allowed against a 1 billion appropriation against a 4 8 billion weapons system now that is not an accommodation that is real money the bill says appropriation based on authorization first to simply say that is a prima facie case that that is a weapons system that is not authorized second i would say to the gentleman from new york this weapons system was not even requested in fiscal year now to the integrity of the process if authorized the house authorization bill did not authorize it it does not appear anywhere in the companion report of the fiscal year 1994 authorization bill just passed by the house further in the other body the companion bill of the dod authorization for fiscal year 1994 also did not authorize this weapons system their report does not speak to it to the gentleman from new york i would ask this question that he might answer in his time if the bill says appropriate upon authorization and the house authorization bill did not authorize it the senate authorization bill did not authorize it the only way that it can be authorized in fiscal year 1994 is both bodies to report back in a conference report s1 billion out of scope where is the precedent for coming back to a body 1 billion out of scope i would suggest that logic stands on this gentlemans side if you can authorize the bill in fiscal year 1994 and you say you cannot appropriate until you authorize and you cannot authorize until fiscal year 1995 then query why then encumber 31 billion in budget authority to appropriate in fiscal year 1994 saying that it is sitting there waiting so some businessman says well if i can take this money from 1994 sit it there until we authorize on october 1 we can rush to start signing contracts we on the house armed services committee take our jobs very seriously i will say to the gentleman from new york if we have rules here how can we argue to vote down a rule because it waives points of order we ought to maintain the integrity of the authorizing process but then when it comes to defense we say but let us set that aside do you want a kangaroo court here do you want rules that govern different subject matters in different ways then this would be a bizarre experience there has to be some continuity this would be a bizarre experience so there has to be some way you can say yes in the authorizing process you can say no in the appropriation process but you cannot turn that around you cannot say no authorization and yes in the appropriation that is the rules that were set up before i came here so i am not here on some personal trip that is insulting i am not here on some ego trip some turf war that is insulting either this body operates on discipline it operates on principle it operates on integrity or it does not so this is not a personal fight here this is not some oneman show finally i would say in order to get beyond that i met with the democratic caucus of our committee and i said i serve at your pleasure what do you wish to do i am prepared as the chair of the committee to tell you what i think but you act if you want to blink blink if you do not want us to blink then do not blink they said do not blink that is why i am here i ask members to support this rule give us the opportunity to maintain the integrity of the

certainly been those in this house who have said we do not need health care reform that everything is just fine that if one has health care insurance now do not worry they are taken care of there is nothing to worry about i want to take this time to talk to the members about an issue that affects me very much personally because i know the people involved this is not some theoretical story this is an actual human beings story who have what is called good health insurance many times people say are you in the congress going to give us the same kind of health care that you have i would suggest to people who say that that they want better than we have in the unitedstates congress all the members of the unitedstates congress belong to the federal employees health benefit program all other federal employees are in that same program i want to talk about what that program really does and how it affects individuals many times as people talk about the whole area of health insurance they say that the problem is the patients the patients they are using the system too much it is costing too much because the patients are the ones at fault in the health care system the theory then is that we ought to have managed care we ought to force everybody into managed care and give people a bunch of booklets to look through so that they can shop smart like buying health insurance was like buying a new automobile or was like buying a new refrigerator if you are going to buy a new refrigerator you know exactly the size of your kitchen you know the space it is going to go you know whether you want a deicer or what kind of attachments you might want on it if you are buying an automobile you know whether you are going to be driving long distances or short distances or over rough terrain or what kind of use you will put that vehicle to the problem with health care for all americans is none of us know what we will need tomorrow we hope that we will never have to use our health insurance there is not anybody out there sort of slathering after using their health insurance people have health insurance policies hopeful that when the time comes and a problem comes to them that health insurance will cover them for the things that they need i was a physician in the state department living in zaire a long time ago in 1987 and as a member of the state department i got to know the director of medical affairs of the unitedstates department of state he has allowed me to use his name and i am going to tell his story and his wifes story because i think it is instructive about what all americans face no matter who you are or in what level you are why we need health reform in this country dr goff is an oncologist that is somebody whose primary specialty is in the treatment of cancer

years old got cancer of the uterus and she had the diagnosis made at a fairly late stage she has had now two operations and several sets of chemotherapy and they recently did what they call an operation to look back and see if the cancer has cleared up there is a reoccurrence and the recommendation made by the hutchinson cancer center in seattle and the doctors in bellingham wa where she lives is she ought to have high dose chemotherapy plus a bone marrow transplant to support that high dose chemotherapy they went to their federal employees health benefit plan and they looked in it and they said well it says it covers bone marrow transplants we will go and get the assurance of the federal plan that we are covered by now the federal plan is administered by blue cross of washington dc here in the city of washington in the capital city even though they live out in washington state their insurance plan is administered by blue cross of washington dc blue cross of washington dc said our plan does not cover your treatment the high dose chemotherapy or the bone marrow transplant so here is a family dr goff is now retired from the state department he has been in the government for 25 years paid into a plan that he every year thought would cover whatever is necessary for his familys wellbeing and suddenly he finds that he has a plan that does not cover his particular problems now he began to do some research because he is an oncologist and he went through the literature and found that things that are covered by that plan there is no more basis for their being covered than for the procedures that his wife was trying to get payment for and in fact in many instances the things that are covered have less scientific basis than what they produce he talked to people at the washington state blue cross blue cross of washington and alaska is in seattle he talked to the medical director there and i talked to him the doctor said yes the federal plan does not cover this kind of treatment but if you happen to be in blue cross of washington state if you are covered by the washington state blue cross this treatment would be covered now i ask you and i ask any member of congress how we can possibly in this body put out the belief to people that we are going to make it possible for them to shop smart you cannot shop smart when you do not know what is going to happen to you when you cannot read your blue cross plan when you do not know what the scientific changes are across the medical field and yet here we are hurdling toward going after presenting to the american people a plan which gives more power to insurance companies what is happening to dr goff and what is happening to lots of americans is that their health care is being rationed right now all the rationing that is going on in this country is being done by insurance companies it is being decided by actuaries it is being decided by accountants people who decide well this only gives somebody 10 percent greater chance we are not going to worry about it we will not give that kind of treatment we will only give treatment to somebody maybe 50 percent or 60 percent or whatever the decisions that are being made in health care today are being made by insurance companies and for the congress to say that we want to get everybody into managed care and therefore we will be able to save money is simply handing control of the health care of all our constituents into the hands of about six or eight large insurance companies in this country now dr goff has a fallback position since his insurance does not pay for it if you want to get a bone marrow transplant i dont care what center it is in the united states they will either take you if your insurance plan covers it or if you can take out of your pocket 60 or 80 or 100 thousand and put it on the table before you come in now this is a doctor he has got a practice he is making a decent living he has a pension and so forth but they will not accept from him oh just come in and have the treatment and pay us when you get the money they wanted the money up front this is in the hutchinson cancer center in seattle and every other cancer center they do not do bone marrow transplants without advance payment or assurance of it from an insurance plan now dr goff is lucky he may be able to take a loan out on his house take the equity out of his house for 60 000 or 80 000 and put that money down and get that kind of treatment for his wife he is lucky not everybody in this country is not lucky enough to be able to come up with 80 000 at the exact time that their loved one whether it is a wife or a child or whomever needs that kind of treatment and what the president has said is that we need health care that can never be taken away and that covers the things that americans are worried about everyone who has insurance right now says why should i be worried well let me tell you the reason why every american including members of congress should be worried is that none of us know whether the policy we have been paying on will cover the kinds of things that may face us and there is no way we can ever be that knowledgeable i am a physician i could not be that knowledgeable nobody can and it is nonsense to say that he american people suddenly we are going to hand them booklets and they are going to then be knowledgeable to buy health insurance any time anybody comes on the floor of this house and says that we will hand around a bunch of booklets and people will know how to buy good health care simply is talking nonsense if dr goff did not know how to do it it is sure that jim mcdermorr will not know how to do it and every member of congress and all the american people are going to be in the same bind now i support the single payer system because i thinkit is the best way to give every one the opportunity to see the physician of their choice to have the biggest benefit package to have it paid for in the most efficient way we can save 100 billion a year the congressional budget office has said by eliminating insurance companies from the process and letting the doctor and the patient make this decision about what ought to be done we can save 100 billion a year which will cover all the benefits which our society presently does not have all of us hope all of us hope desperately hope that we will never use our health insurance we do not want to use it it is not something people lie around at night saying gee i wonder how i can get some benefits out of my insurance policy that would be like saying you would want to have some benefits out of your fire insurance policy maybe if we had a fire in the house we could finally get some benefits out of that nobody want that and tbe fact is that the single payer system is the only way you can guarantee to the american people that you provide a benefit package that covers the things that people need with an affordable cost and i hope that this congress will consider the case of dr goff and all the other people he is not alone there was a case in california of a woman who had breast cancer and the doctors recommended a bone marrow transplant for her and she did not have the money so she had to go around and try and raise the money finally she got it but too late she died but the case was settled in the california courts for 84 million very simply because the contract that she had from the managed care operation said they did bone marrow transplants what it didnt say was we dont do bone marrow transplants if you have breast cancer so she thought she was covered and in fact that same case was settled really in large measure because they found a provision in the internal memos of the company which said to the doctors if you dont make referrals for bone marrow transplants you will get paid more that is what managed competition is all about that is what managed care under insurance companies is all about it is not directed at what is in the best interest of the patient it is directed at what is in the best interest of the stockholders you have to remember that managed care from insurance companies simply is designed in a corporation to take in as much money as possible spend as little on benefits as possible so at the end of the quarter you can give the biggest dividends to the stockholders and a health insurance plan run by insurance companies with managed care by insurance companies is not going to be good for the american people that is why i support the american health security act which is the sin glepayer plan h r 1200 i hope every member of this congress will read that bill and consider it the best for all their constituents"], [0.5116582214832306, 0.4883417785167694, 1, "i thank the gentleman for his very clear explanations and for calling this special order on the very important budget reconciliation package there is no more important time than now as we move toward a resolution of thi matter a vote we need to throw more light on the subject like most of my colleagues when i was back in the district during the recess i encountered a great deal of anger and hostility from people about what is going on in washington the anger and hostility comes from every level it is not ust the middle income welleducated voters who are very articulate and let you know it is also the people on the street who were very disappointed people who had been promised that this new administration would put people first there were going to be some definite changes and they have not seen those changes materialize lot me just take one very graphic example the summer youth employment program the summer youth employment program was to be increased the clinton administration came in proposing an increase of about s1 5 billion a little more than a billion and a half dollars which would have translated in a place like new york city to an additional 35 000 jobs these are jobs for lowincome youths unemployed in the summer many of their salaries go to support the whole family i know from my close association with the program over the years at every level that these are jobs which put money in the hands of poor youth and families and those youth and families pour it right back into small businesses they do not invest it anywhere they do not take trips to switzerland or the cayman islands they go to the sneaker store they go to the clothing store they go to the school supply store and they pump money back into the economy immediately it is very important that those jobs for those youth flow but they did not increase anymore than a paltry 166 5 million the clinton administration proposed a 1 5 billion stimulus package when they got through cutting it down from 1 5 billion down to 166 5 million and when you divide that across the whole country the increase in the number of jobs this summer was not that great over the number of jobs last summer translated as i said before to new york city it meant we lost 35 000 jobs by not having the presidents original proposals acted upon we passed it in the house n the socalled stimulus package but it was filibustered by the other body one program officer told me it had a waiting list of 3 5 youngsters under the appropriation they got they were only able to provide jobs to 75 youngsters seven hundred fifty youngsters meant that the others went without jobs a few days after they told me that young people would apply for those jobs that most of them would not get jobs a few days after that there was a robbery and murder that took place in a local park the head of the program told me that two of the boys involved in that robbery and murder were below the age of 16 they were on the list one was number 3 003s and the other was number 3 004 on the list they had been told this ido not excuse anybody from participating in a robbery or a murder there is no excuse for that but i wonder what bearing it would have had if they had been told the good news yes you got a job this summer would they have been out there in that park with the rest of the gang people are angry for good reason they have seen that the prosperity of our economy has moved forward we are far wealthier now than we were 12 years ago before the reagan and bush administrations took office as a whole the country is wealthier our companies are doing very well large companies are makingmore money than ever before at the same time they are making huge profits they are laying off people what is going on everybody is trembling in fear for their jobs because despite the fact that their companies are doing very well in order to lower their costs or for whatever purposes they want to accomplish some of the most stable giants in american industry are laying off thousands and thousands of people so we are not sharing in the wealth they are saying something is radically wrong they are angry they are angry at politicians they are angry at the democratic party they are angry at the president this anger certainly is very much misguided as the presentation has shown here tonight we have very much moved in order with the presidents proposal to put people first the president has been willing to bite the bullet the package that we have passed in this house and i want to stress the fact that we talked a great deal about small business and there is a need to counteract the campaign to make it appear that small businesses will suffer but i want to stress the fact in my presentation that in addition to small businesses not suffering but instead benefiting we also have a package which was the presidents package passed by the house a combination of the presidents package and the housepassed package was a balanced package it was very well balanced balanced in terms of the expenditures as has been pointed out we made the hard decisions and made cuts not all of us agreed with all those cuts but most democrats ended up supporting that package it was balanced in terms of revenue not all of us agreed with all the taxes we think maybe there should have been more taxes on the rich who have benefited so greatly from the eighties but nevertheless we supported that package the other part of it was that it was also balanced in terms of certain programs that put people first it has a childhood immunization feature it has enterprise zones for the poorest cities it has earned income tax credit to guarantee that people who work every day will have some help from the government so they do not fall below the poverty line it is a first step in terms of president clintons welfare reform program we had an expansion of the food stamp program it had these items in there in addition to the cuts and the extra taxes it all balanced out we all voted for it as we move toward the finalization of the process as the senate and the house conferees discuss this in debate they should not lose sight of the balance less and less talk has occurred over the past few days about childhood immunization and the provision in the bill concerning that enterprise zones earned income tax credit there seems to be some kind of budding gentlemans agreement that all that is expendable that can go we are not going to put people first we are going to put the deficit first deficit is important and people do benefit from a reduction of the deficit it has been pointed out here quite clearly that the lowering of interest rates benefits everybody so we are not going to say the deficit is not important but let us not forget people ought to come first and that in terms of a proportion of that package the programs which benefit people directly people have been neglected for the last 12 years is a very small piece childhood immunization is not a large amount of money being set aside for that enterprise zones earned income tax credit they do not amount to large amounts of money so while i congratulate the president on the fact that he has bitten the bullet and congratulating the members of the house who supported the presidents package we recognize that this plan really puts us back in the goal of our economic destination after 12 years of finger pointing president clinton is stepping up to the plate to deal with it the president does not like to fix blame much but i do not hesitate to fix blame the blame is on the excesses of the bush and the reagan administrations we had a transfer of wealth drained out of the middle class and pumped into the top 1 percent the top 6 percent of the income bracket that is pretty clear one does not have to exaggerate that is not a wild radical statement the statistics show where the money went they benefited from government policies people are always talking about get government off our backs government should not be involved leave it to private industry that is the biggest lie that has ever been perpetuated the people who got wealthy during the eighties all had some connection with the way the government policies moved and the way government transferred wealth from the middle income folks up to higher levels we transferred it in many ways in the name of defense we poured excessive amounts of money into weapons systems we transferred it in many ways clearly by swindling the american people out of billions of dollars in the savings and loans swindle the savings and loan swindle probably will amount to 500 billion taken out of the pockets of the american taxpayers and put into the hands of some of the wealthiest people in the country due to regulations distorted policies and just plain crookedness in many cases complicity between government officials and people in the banking industry so in various ways we created the deficit and now if we accept the fact that the deficit is the most important thing on the agenda we are allowing president bush and president reagan who have created the deficit to reach into the present administration and be a determining factor in the way we spend policy we have to deal with the deficit but let us not get lost or blinded by our attempt to act responsibly with respect to the deficit let us not fail to put people first we have to deal with spending cuts as i said before some of those spending cuts should be made and some of them i question and there are many spending cuts that we have not made yet and i assume that the new administration coming in having won in november and doing a transition period having come in in january we knew this budget was put together under very strange circumstances i assume that we are going to have a budget that really reflects the new administration in the next goaround we are moving to keep matters going this bridget is important it does set some precedents it does liy out the direction in which we will be going in the next 4 years but i do not accept it as anything final i wait to see the next budget produced by the administration and i hope that the spending cuts then will be more reflective of the philosophy of putting people first of the spending cuts they will recognize what was done to us in the 1980s by the reagan and bush administrations we had star wars you know brilliant pebbles we are going to stop rockets by shooting pebbles into the skies billions of dollars invested into that unfortunately but the greatest surprise is that the present administration also continues to support star wars most of the scientists you know twothirds of the scientists in this country in the time star wars was proposed said that it was not a workable idea after billions of dollars have been poured into it it still is not close to being workable yet we are continuing to fund it that is a cut we should be making and we can take a large cut there because it is a large amount of money we are continuing to fund the administration is continuing to support the superconducting super collider you know in this present budget we are talking about 600andsome million over the life of that program we are talking about another 8 to 9 billion i am not against science i do not think it is just a big ditch i think it is based on sound scientific concept for the superconducting supercollider it is a boondoggle as it is being implemented the superconducting super collider is something which at least could be slowed down but given the fact that it is being implemented in the old style massive overruns already are under way it is best to just bring it to a halt and accept the return of that money to the budget to take care of other kinds of needs the administration is behind it but the house of representatives is not overwhelmingly the house of representatives voted to end the superconducting super collider project that would generate a great deal of money for programs which put people first it certainly could take care of the childhood immunization program it could take care of some of the other expenses that i have mentioned in terms of a balanced budget items that are in there for people but my colleagues know i do not want to take away from the fact that we have passed as members of the house a good plan the plan will create jobs 8 million of them over the next 4 years permanent productive private sector jobs the plan is a good job generator because it makes it easier for businesses to grow if we keep interest rates at their present low level for the rest of this year we will have pumped 100 billion of new private sector capital into the economy let those who say that the president has not bitten the bullet the president has not in the first few months of his administration parted the country in a new direction let them take heed we will have pumped 100 billion of new private sector capital into the economy if we can keep the present interest rates going the plan also targeted new incentives to encourage business especially as we are talking here today about small businesses being encouraged to create new jobs the plan will improve the standard of living the interest rates mean that you could buy a car buy a home and buy a lot of other things at a lower price than you can afford before this is real money the pockets of real people you can finance a 100 000 mortgageinstead of paying 10 percent for 7 5 percent and you will have saved 175 a month that is more than 10 times what you will be paying in new taxes the middleincome families will be paying in new taxes this is real change this is something you can sink your teeth into never mind what the talk show hosts say the radio talk show hosts and the television talk show hosts they insist on oversimplifying you know they are in a sense being simple minded about what is going on here in washington all they can see is new taxes all they can see is broadbrush actions and they will not discuss the bread and butter of what is going on one hundred seventyfive dollars a month saved on ones mortgage is really bread and butter this is a fundamental break from the old failed trickledown policies of the past it is a change that is historic in its scope it is the largest deficit reduction in history the biggest set of spending cuts in history it is real change the old ways have left deficits out of control and now we are talking about putting our economic house in order trickledown sheltered the powerful and the privileged and tried to balance the budget on the backs of the forgotten middle class this economic plan is fair it is shared and it is balanced the rich are finally paying their fair share more than threefourths of the taxes in this plan are being paid by the wealthiest 6 percent of upperincome level in this economy the working poor actually get a break if you make 30 000 a year or less and have children in the home this plan gives you a tax break to help you raise your children above the poverty line your earned income tax credit that is part of what i am talking about now when i say a balanced piece in this package we cannot let the earned income tax be eroded the other body has already drastically cut the earned income tax credit as it was passed by this house we must not in conference yield to this very important people program we have to put people first and the earned income tax is probably the most important item in terms of putting people first and it is also the beginning of a welfare reform approach that makes a lot of sense the middle class wins in this plan this plan of the president and the house of representatives the middle class wins after 12 years in which the republicans taxed working class people and they gave the money to the wealthy people this is a plan in which the middle class truly wins the total tax burden on the middle class ranges from 2 a month in the senate version to a maximum of 17 a month in the house version but what you get for that look at what you get for that you get lower interest rates on everything from your home to your car loan to your credit card payments you get historic deficit reduction real spending cuts and 200 specific programs incentives for businesses to create jobs here in america and the kind of sustained longterm growth that america needs as the gentleman from maryland pointed out you need longterm sustained growth in order for our children to have jobs and our grandchildren to have jobs we have to make that beginning by biting the bullet and dealing with the deficit now this plan makes real cuts in specific programs this plan could make more cuts but the cuts have at least begun on the business as usual deficit reduction disappeared in the old bush and reagan years they started out talking about deficit reduction but each year we found that it did not happen the deficit reduction is taking place here now for every 10 we put in a 500 billion trust fund 5 comes from 4 comes from taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent and only 1 percent comes from the middle class the trust fund will be proof that we really are paying down the deficit unlike the policies of the past when the republicans used gimmicks like budget caps that were lifted or ignored when they saw fit in the old way of doing things the most vulnerable were the most victimized under this plan we do achieve more deficit reduction than the republican proposals with less than half of the level of cuts in medicare veterans benefits and health care the other body is all wrong the are proposing medicare cuts they have proposed medicaid cuts which are not necessary the old way of doing business is what they want to continue the old way of doing business allowed politicians to look no further thanthe next election but this plan does look to the next generation i cannot stress too much the comparison between the plan of the president and the house of representatives our plan versus the plan of the other body i hope the conferees will remember the people who are there to reach a final decision along with the representatives of the other body i hope they will remember and the american people out there will remember them that we have a balanced package and we do not want food stamp expansion to be cut out seven billion dollars in that package that we passed the presidents package and the house package 7 billion for food stamp expansion the senate has zero for food stamp expansion we have a billion dollars for family preservation in that package the senate has zero for family preservation we have 2 1 billion for childhood immunization the senate has far less because they cut back drastically on the childhood immunization program we want to maintain the balance these programs are important these programs put people first consider the fact that only 55 percent of the nations 2yearolds were fully immunized against vaccinepreventible diseases in 1991 only 55 percent a little more than half despite the fact that we have the technology we have the chemistry we have everything we need to accomplish these vaccinations only 56 percent of the nations 2yearolds were fully immunized because of these low immunization rates a measles epidemic swept across the country and claimed over 56 000 victims between 1989 and 1991 the epidemic killed 166 and hospitalized 11 000 americans when you have a measles epidemic they have a residue because women who are pregnant and get measles their children are born with hearing defects we have a large bulge in the population who have hearing defects and a lot of children are born deaf as a result of measles it carries over for many many years in terms of the necessity to compensate for that the house passed a universal vaccine assurance system as part of the budget reconciliation bill our bill and the presidents bill the good bill was passed with this universal vaccine assurance system the new plan would serve 11 1 million children who are uninsured or under insured medicaid eligible or native american all of the children will have their immunizations paid for by their private health insurance the house also included provisions for parent education and immunization registry and a reminder system and an extension of the vaccine injury compensation program the senate budget reconciliation bill would only require states to buy vaccines in bulk no vaccine assurance program would be created by the senate plan the house version must prevail in conference for the following reasons the house version of the childhood immunization initiative will help more children the house bill includes medicaid immunization improvements such as parental coordination coordination with wic and other mca programs and better reimbursement rates the senate did not include these medicaid reforms passage of the childhood immunization act is a warmup for the national health reform a loss on this issue will be a victory for the drug industry against the president the other body is wrong the conferees of the house must not yield on the childhood immunization program finally the eitc the earned income tax credit proposal that has been adopted by the other body also has serious shortcomings the senate eitc proposal fails to offset the transportation tax which they have imposed on millions of working poor households this is due in large part to the committees rejection of the proposed eitc for poor workers without children the senate proposal also makes several million working families with children worse off than they would be under current law it cuts their eitc by up to 77 in tax year 1994 and up to 55 in subsequent years while simultaneously the transportation tax which the senate has put on the gasoline tax which will be paid by everybody puts a new burden on these same families finally although it comes close the senate plan falls to achieve the presidents goal of lifting a family of four which has a fulltime yearround wage earner a working person in the family is not lifted to the poverty line in the senate program as it does in the case of the house and presidents program in conclusion i again want to congratulate all of my colleagues who participated in this special order and want to urge them not to succumb to some of the easy answers that are being proposed there are some people who say the best way to get out of this impasse is to just forget about any new taxes on the middle class the transportation tax for example and dump the people first programs if you do not have the tax on fuel the tax on energy then you can compensate for that by not dealing with childhood immunization and eitc dump the people first programs and take away the taxes i think that is the wrong step it means we have not changed anything here in washington we have not heard the voice of the people the people who are out there angry now will have every reason to continue to be angry with us we should put people first and understand that what makes our democracy great is not the fact we have more people who are well off more people who are educated but we have instead more people who participate i invite everybody every voter every citizen to continue participating watch this process keep your eyes on the prize as we wind up this process of budget reconciliation which is one of the most important duties of this congress we should hear from the people who are constituents we should hear from the people who put us here they should take a backseat now but insist that reason prevail over the special interests that usually do prevail instead of focusing on the deficit blindly and refusing to recognize the people programs instead of focusing on cuts and refusing to make the cuts that are necessary in places where we should make cuts we should keep our eyes on the prize and make sure that we do not sacrifice very important programs like the childrens immunization program enterprise zones the earned income tax credit and the food stamp expansion"], [0.5114933550357819, 0.48850664496421814, 1, "i yield myself the remainder of my time first i have to differ with my friend the gentleman from texas he has been a consistent and principal supporter of deficit reduction when he said the amendment i am offering does not guarantee defense reduction he was right but i must say i think he overspoke when he suggested that it was unrelated to deficit reduction you cannot in the budget resolution repeal statutory caps i concede that what i can do is to do away with budget authority budget authority is what this process cedes to the appropriations committees to make binding future spending commitments when you reduce budget authority by 2 4 billion as this does you take away 2 4 billion in future spending commitments that is why the national taxpayers union and citizens against government waste have endorsed this because it greatly advances the cause of deficit reduction let us now talk about the reductions that have already held several members here eloquently refuted a statement that no one has made no one has suggested that there have not been cuts in defense spending the question is have they been appropriate yes there have been buts in defense spending partly that is because during the early 1980s when we had a commanderinchief named ronald reagan defense spending was bloated beyond that however there has been achange in the reality that the defense department confronts i guess i should have had some charts i would have had one chart which would have talked about reductions in the warsaw pact threat except the chart would have gone down into the first floor ten years ago we were told that one of the major reasons we were spending money in defense was to prevent the eastern europeans behind the soviet union in a land invasion of western europe nato was created for that we were spending tens and tens of billions of dollars to protect western europe against an attack in which the soviet union led the warsaw pact countries to the west there is no soviet union there is no warsaw pact and several of those countries do not exist anymore no agency of the federal government has seen external reality change for the better as much as the defense department yes there are threats in the world but let us not pretend they are new people said well we have these other threats iraq and iran iraq and iran are menacing countries but they are not new what were iraq and iran in 1984 disneyworld there has been a substantial drop in the nature of the threat we face the capacity of the soviet union to damage us in nuclear war has been substantially diminished although not totally abolished and the warsaw pact has completely disappeared the significant threat is gone so of course we have made some reductions it would have been nuts not to the question is have we made enough people say well there is a shortfall in defense no doubt from the standpoint of the people who run that agency there is a shortfall but we have got some other shortfalls we have a shortfall in police protection in this country we have promised and promised and promised again more police protection but you will spend it up when the pentagon says we need it first we have shortfalls in education shortfalls in health research at the nih shortfalls in environmental cleanup shortfalls in health care for people yes there are shortfalls the nature of government in a time of limited resources is to try to do the best you can to deal with shortfalls but there are people here who get scared politically and who will tell you that the one area where we must immunize them against the threat of shortfall is the pentagon where we are talking national defense that is one thing but we are talking more than national defense we are talking about the greatest charity program in the history of the world the one by which the taxpayers of the united states subsidize again and again and again the richest nations in the world in western europe our western european allies spend a small fraction of what we spend as a percentage of national wealth but that isbecaus6 there are people in this body who believe it is somehow the american taxpayers obligation to subsidize france norway belgium germany italy and other countries because subsfdize them we do they will cut their military budgets they will provide greater services for their own people and we will take up the slack for them no one doubts that we are by far the strongest nation in the world with a considerable margin of superiority over everyone else of course we should be the question is whether we will continue when the rest of the world gets richer and when the threat gets smaller to spend disproportionately on defense there are plenty of places in this function that they can find 2 4 billion we have intelligence the intelligence agencies are the only ones who when they screw up say they need more money when they do not do well that is an argument for giving them moremoney we have the burdensharing where we carry western europe we have weapons systems there and is it a coincidence or was there a high correlation between those who came and spoke for the budget and those who have defense money spent in their districts now the defense department like any other department has a missiofi and it also has goodies to hand out it also has people who benefit from it some of my friends on the other side talked again about the jobs we would lose one of the great inconsistencies in this country is that conservatives who tell you thatthe government is a detractor from jobs the government hurts the economy when the government spends it doesnt hurt anythingexcept for defense where defense is concerned suddenly they become harold ickess and harry hopkins defense for them is the wpa defense spending ought to be treated the same as any other yes it has dropped some from the days when it wasway too high but the threat has also dropped if we do this for the defense department today it comes either out of the deficit or out of other domestic programs i think that is an unnecessary restriction to place upon ourselves"], [0.5112329125404358,

agree with them that the specific provisions of this proposai speak to the future but i do not like what they say they say that our future should be smaller and dimmer they say that it is time to abandon at least some of our hopes and some of our dreams they say that it is better to stay in a cramped drafty creaking house than to take the risk of taking out a slighty larger mortgage they say it is time to discard many of the promises we have made to our citizens to our children and our parents alike that is a fine lesson for our children let us look at some of the particular targets of this proposal perhaps more than anything else in the federal budget research spending promises us a better future we may be indined to take the benefits of research for granted but how many of us could honestily say that our lives have not been improved by the results of federally sponsored research so we find that research is a particular target the authors of this proposal try not to discimdnate they cut space research but they cut medical research by the same percentage just last week in the debate on nafta we heard many voices inside this chamber and outside it insist that the future of our nation lies in research and new technology and here we are just a few days later considering how we can cut back on it any of us who have ever lived in creaky old houses know that some spending is necessary and sensible we know that it is a good idea to install new mechanical systems and to make use of new technology we know that it will save us money in the long run by improving our efficiency our enhancing the value of our house millions of people are ready and willing to borrow to finance sensible improvements but this proposal says we should stick with the same old plumbing to mention just one example it proposes to terminate funding for maglev rail maglev may be expensivejust like that new plumbing but it promises us a much more efficient means of transportation would we really be better off as a nation today if we had decided 50 years ago that interstate highways and jetports were just too expensive and that we would do just as well if we drove into the future on a twolane blacktop i dont think so we can all agree that if there is one thing we want for our own children and for the children of this nation it is a good education so education spending becomes another target of the proposal it cuts federal support for unlversities by cutting support for research as i have already mentioned it cuts support for e1ementary and secondaly education programs it cuts programs to help the disadvantaged what kind of message are we sending with this are we telling our children that we do not really mean it when we tell them to get the best education they can are we telling them we would really rather they drop out of school so that we could cut school spending some more are we telling them education is a good idea but we dont want to invest any money in it i think we are i have heard it said that we should make these cuts because of our children because we should not burden them with debt yet our higher education programs are based on the principle that our children should burden themselves with debt in order to improve their future which one do we mean are we telling our young people that they should not go to college because college requires spending i hope notbut that is how it sounds to me some will say that the cuts in education are only a small part of this proposal and that is true they will further say that it helps young people since its chief target is benefits for older peoplemedicare and pension benefits specifically they will say they are really young people since it is unfair to make our young people assume the burden of assisting their elders and surely some young people will welcome that message but in fact this is just another form of the same message about our future and about their future it isa dark message t is a message that they can expect to stay in that same old creaky house for the rest of their fives the cuts proposed in medicare tell them first that the government can make the promises made to them and it will break them it will reserve the right to increase their burdens when they are old and sick and no longer able to work but t sends them a more imnedlate message too those medicare savings cut into the pool of money that could be used to 5lnance a universal health care program are we going to scuttle that plan right now are we going to tell our young people and our working families that their hopes for health security can we be tossed out the window right now i hope not the final argument for this amendment has been mat it is the responsible thing to do even if it is unpleasant even if it does narrow our horizons even if t does dampen our hopes but again i see it as the opposite to me its message is irresponsible the cuts named in this plan are being called savings but what about the costs who will pay for the cuts in medicaid for example will the costs be passed along to state and local government what about the cost of cutting into child care will they be borne by working families will they force people to give up their jobs the problem is not that the amendment cuts government spending we si have our ideas on how government spending can and should be cut the problem is how it cuts spending the bill we have before us cuts spending in responsible ways it was the product of a careful review and it genuinely targets unnecessary spending those cuts are sensible ones ones that will not increase costs in other ways cuts that will not compromise our future every action the physicists teil us has an equal and opposite reactlon that is true of what we do here as well these cuts are not without consequences we know that our failure to fix the plumbing or repair the roof in an aging house is not really a savings we know t will have consequencq and we know it will only increase costs later before you vote for ths proposal take a long and hard look at the consequences cutting spending should not be an end in itself t certainly is not an end in itself in managing our own affairs we know enough to fix the roof to visit the doctor end take our plls even when it means a cash outlay look at the true costs of ths package i believe they greatly exceed the true savings"], [0.5112247169017792, 0.4887752830982208, 1, "mr speaker i am quite pleased to assist the gentleman in unraveling and clarifying the great partisan plot that is underway to confuse the american people about health care reform i want to discuss another subject we heard before an accusation that health care reform has been moved too fast and that the american people are being rushed into this but the process started 2 years ago and i have not seen a more deliberative process applied to any piece of legislation in the 12 years that i have been in the house of representatives this has been and continues to be a very deliberative process large numbers of people and resources have been brought to bear in developing the legislation relating to health care from the clinton plan all the way to the present plans being offered by the leadership of the other body and the leadership of this house there is another very serious problem which is not getting that kind of deliberative process not benefitting from that kind of deliberative process that is the welfare reform process the welfare reform proposals i think we are being stampeded into the acceptance of legislation related to welfare reform there is a need for much more deliberation on that it is very unfortunate that some of the people who have come forward to serve as the experts on welfare reform have been people who have had no contact with human resources programs in the past some of the members former members of the committee on intelligence have come forward as experts on welfare reform some members on the committee on appropriations have come forward as experts on welfare reform on and on it goes it seems some of the people who are most hostile toward poor people have put themselves forward as the experts on welfare reform they are hostile to poor people on the one hand on the other hand they are not hostile to waste and subsidy in government now here is the problem i think the american people are concerned with welfare reform because they think it will end a great deal of waste in goveminent and they do not want to see the waste they want to see people helped surveys and focus groups all kinds of mechanisms show that basically the american people want to see people helped who do need help but they do not want to see waste it is very interesting how members of congress from all kinds of committees and all shades of the spectrum conservative neoconservative liberal everybody wants to move and move rapidly on welfare reform and yet there are many other areas where there is a great deal of waste in government that nobody is concerned with i think it would be great and i want to explain from the very beginning that i am not opposed to president clintons initiative on welfare reform i think when he says we are going to end welfare as we know it and we are going to place emphasis on jobs to replace welfare that he is moving in a direction with which i certainly agree now i have no problem with putting i greater emphasis on jobs and less emphasis on welfare i will come back to that in a minute but if you are concerned about waste in government and you want to see our dollars spent most effectively then we ought to be concerned with subsidy reform we ought jto ask ourselves the question in how many ways are we subsidizing people how many are we subsidizing americans are we subsidizing businessmen are we subsidizing farmers it is one thing to help victims and we do subsidize victims in order to help them whether it is a victim of the economic system a person who needs a job does not have a job and unemployment insurance is there if they are not employed and do not qualify for unemployment insurance welfare is there to help the victim if they are the victim of an earthquake we have earthquake disaster relief funds to help if they are a victim ofa flood we have relief to help if they are a victim of a hurricane we have hurricane relief so we help victims i think it is very much fitting and proper that government should help victims of all kinds but let us take a look at our other subsidies and even subsidies for victims welfare victims people who are on welfare are victims of an economic order that does not provide the jobs which are necessary either the jobs are not there which are necessary for the fathers who if they had a job would be able to support their children i am all in favor of welfare reform which emphasizes a greater enforcement of child support payments but we also ought to recognize that if the fathers do not have jobs no matter how hard you try to cannot get them to make payments of money they do not have somewhere in welfare reform we ought to put in incentives for fathers who do not make payments incentives built in so that we provide jobs for you oncondition you make payments of course if we provide a job we will make certain that you make payments but there is no discussion of providing jobs to fathers so that fathers will make the payments and take care of their children everything focuses on the mothers of children who are underage dependent children but i am an in favor of a program which understands that the fathers am victims as well as mothers who want to go to work and cannot find jobs they are victims we need to help victims that is what welfare is all about flood relief is all about helping victims victims of floods who need help and government should help but if we look at what we provide individuals who are victims of floods we may find that it is far more than we provide individuals who happen to be victims of economic conditions especially those people who have been victims of floods 2 or 3 times they get low interest loans they get all kinds of disaster relief aid there are a number of things we do victims of earthquakes some of whom live in the same areas that have been victims of earthquakes more than once we give low interest loans to rebuild houses as my colleagues know large amounts of money ae laid out to take care of victims of earthquakes or victims of hurricanes if we examine some of the expenditures in the budget recently in just the last 3 years we appropriated 8 billion for earthquake relief for the california earthquake again i am all in favor of helping victims but we ought to take a look at how much did each victim get as my colleagues know should we say there is a limit are we going to argue that welfare people should be on welfare for 2 years and no more and we should figure out what is the cost of being on welfare for 2 years is that the amount of money we are going to give to all victims whether they are victims of earthquakes or victims of floods or victims of hurricanes are we going to set a limit on what we give to victims people who are victims of floods last year the midwest flood we appropriated 6 billion 6 billion before that we had the hurricane in florida we appropriated 6 billion i am not saying million i am talking about billions of dollars to help victims i am all in favor of helping victims why do we put the welfare victims in another category i say to my colleagues you may find if you look at the cost per family and the cost per person what we do to help victims of earthquakes floods and hurricanes is far greater per individual and per family than we do for some of the victims of economic conditions which forces people onto welfare that is something we ought to think about but my main point does not relate to that because victims should be helped we all agree that the government one of the roles of the government should be to come to the aid of people who are victims there are some people who axre not victims who are receiving continual subsidies from the government and if we are going to have welfare reform i think we ought to broaden it into subsidy reform and even put our emphasis there deal with subsidy reform even before we deal with welfare reform because welfare most of the people on welfare are victims sixtyeight percent of the people on welfare are children who have no control over their fate sixtyeight percent ae children the people who are on subsidies like the farmers home loan mortgage program are not victims the farmers who get subsidies for their grazing and they graze their cattle and the cattle get fat and they sell them and we pay large amounts of money for the meat that we have subsidized they do not need subsidies they are not victims the farmers who ae receiving subsidies now at this late date the farm subsidy program has been going on for many several decades we are subsidizing farmers to keep the price of certain foods up so that we pay twice we pay as taxpayers on the subsidy and then we pay a higher price for groceries a higher price for food as a result of the subsidies of the farmers farmers now constitute less than 3 percent of the population of the united states as my colleagues know so we ae not subsidizing individuals we are subsidizing farming corporations agricultural corporations it is big business we are subsidizing big business and calling it farm subsidies then we say we need these farm subsidies in order to guarantee that america will always have farmers and never be in a position where we have our food supply jeopardized well these are big businesses like any other big business and why should we subsidize them in order to have them produce a product let them face competition the farm subsidies are enormous billions of dollars it goes on and on and we have not weighed in to do anything about that farmers home loan mortgages to go back to farmers for a minute farmers home loan mortgages have been exposed as a massive racketeering enterprise do my colleagues hear what i am saying a massive racketeering enterprise on the front pages of the washington post several months ago there was a story which nobody questioned the facts the facts were accepted as true that 115 billion in loans and i said 11 5 billion not million 11 billion in loans had been forgiven by the department of agriculture to farmers these axe farmers home loan mortgages eleven point five billion had been forgiven what does it mean to forgive it means that loans that had been loans before were transformed into gifts they do not have to pay it back the taxpayers moneys have been given to the farners 11 5 billion over the last 5 years i say to my colleagues if you want to save money then lets go after that kind of subsidy which is going to nonvictims these are loans on farms eleven point five billion was forgiven in the same story the names of fbur millionaires were cited they actually gave the names and the facts related to four millionaires who were farmers on the side they had other businesses but they were farmers and those four millionaires had not repaid had not made payments on their loans for up to 5 from 5 to 10 years one had not made a payment on his loan in 10 years one of the individuals cited one of the millionaires cited was also on a board which decided on whether or not credit would be extended to farmers who had these loans on an actual board they had been appointed by the previous administration under mr bush so her is a case where we had massive amounts of subsidies and massive amounts of waste it was all exposed on the front pages of the washington post and not a single committee of congress has held a hearing on it i heard talk in the elevator shortly after the story was broken by the washington post a person on the committee on agriculture said we are going to have hearings on that we are going to deal with that i have not seen any hearings held on the racketeering e4terprise called the farmers hole loan mortgages the subsidies that farmers receive may be more legal more legitimate we may not be giving away money in such a blatant way but farmers also receive that farmers who have cattle or ranches they call them out west they graze on government land and they get the grazing rights on the land for less than half of what they pay on private land we are subsidizing the farmers to fatten their cattle that they then sell to us massive amounts of money could be raised if we raised the fee on government land for the farmers to graze miners out west receive enormous subsidies by having land for mining sold to them at very low prices even gold miners get very low prices massive subsidies and of course some other subsidies that we are more familiar with which are more universal they do not just cover the farm territories the west and the far west they cover the whole country that is the s l subsidy subsidies that went to savings and loan banks that failed we hear a lot today about whitewater whitewater is shallow water compared to silverado whitewater is all about an s l that failed that had less than a half a billion dollars or did it have a hundred million i do not even think it was a hundred million the bank that failed in that case did not even have a hundred million silverado was in the billion dollar category silverado was a situation where the board of the bank silverado bank agreed to have a loan given to purchase a building in denver and the building was worth 13 million but the board agreed to loan the people who were purchasing the building 26 million twice as much as was needed on condition that the person deposited the extra money in the silverado bank as my colleagues know if ever there was a racketeering enterprise if ever that was a deal that the bank made with the lender to benefit the bank all of which is illegal and when this bank of course making deals like that went under the american people were left holding the bag because we insure the deposits of all the people who deposit their money in the silverado bank silverado made many deals like that so it went broke to the tune of more than 1 billion this is what happened to a young man named bush the son of george bush neal bush he sat on the board of silverado that was big money far bigger than whitewater but democrats were so kind and never had hearings which really dealt with silverado and the kind of stealing racketeering that went on in the case of the silverado bank but we subsidized that taxpayers we subsidize the banks we stand behind the deposits and we have seen in the savings and loan situations when they go under the insurance that they pay the depositors insurance is quickly when you have massive bankruptcies is quickly used up we then dip into the taxpayers till it is off budget so there is not much discussion about it but we have subsidized the failed savings and loans to the tune of more than a quarter of a trillion dollars 250 billion and they keep the figures very confused and very secret but stanford university predicts when it is all over the savings and loans subsidies will cost the taxpayers 500 billion that is half a trillion dollars that is conservative figure from stanford university so i am saying we are subsidizing some of the richest people in america we ought to look at all of these subsidies not welfare reform but we ought to talk about subsidy reform and talk about how we can save money by making sure that everything we subsidize as taxpayers is legitimate that everything is not exploited by racketeering enterprises that we subsidize we ought to take a look at that and we ought to take a look at victims and understand that while we want to help victims we want to be just and fair and try to help victims equally and not be hostile toward poor people who are on welfare just because they are poor and do not have lawyers and lobbyists we are going to go after them with a vengeance and have congress stampeded into a welfare reform bill as i said before i do not like the way we are being stampeded and moving too fast toward welfare reform we are developing a lot of experts who are not experts who are too hostile toward poor people i do favor president clintons basic approach that we are going to give people jobs instead of welfare but i want the jobs to be real jobs i think americas problems as it goes into the new world order can be very much resolved we can solve a lot of our problems by putting a greater emphasis on jobs and the role of the government to create jobs a major role of the unitedstates government the federal government it should be the creation of jobs you create jobs two ways you stimulate the economy in very concrete kinds of ways to create opportunities for private enterprise to create the jobs or you provide direct jobs as a last resort i think if you handle the economy properly accept the major role of the government to stimulate the economy we would create 75 percent of the jobs that need to be created through stimulus packages the kind the president had on the table last year stimulus packages which would lead to contracts going out to private enterprises to build the roads to build the schools to do all the things that have to be done there is a lot of work to be done there is a lot of work to be done in america right now for the next decade there is still a lot of work to be done we can adopt a full employment policy providing work for everybody and we would not have to worry about welfare except for the very feeble and the very old and people who could not work we would not have to talk about replaciiig welfare with real jobs the economy would do it for us it would be stimulated and we could go forward i am all in favor of that portion of the proposed welfare r9form let us have jobs real jobs when i first came to congress the first bill i put in was a bill which called for a constitutional amendment to guarantee a job opportunity to every american who want to work a constitutional amendment to guarantee a job opportunity to every american who wants to work i was told that is pie in the sky it is naive it is left wing et cetera you know it is nothing new the new deal bill of rights roosevelt had already proposed before so i cannot claim it as a new and creative idea to provide jobs and to have the society have a responsibility to provide jobs it is not a new idea in fact it is very closely related to the very fundamental basis of our civilization civilization is based on a premise that individuals out there in the jungle have something to gain by uniting with other individuals and living by a certain code we create societies we ceate a civilization by accepting certain rules certain codes certain regulations and not living by the survival of the fittest doctrine that is you go into the jungle and you are hungry somebody else has a piece of meat you go ahead and take it we have gone beyond that you live in a civilized society and say it is not right to take things from people there is an assumption that the society we create is going to be superior to the jungle the society we create is going to be superior to the jungle if it is going to be superior then we always have to make the assumption that that society is going to provide a way some way for every individual to earn a living to be able to earn income to be able to survive the society owes it to an individual to provide a way to earn a living that is basic so when we say we are going to replace welfare with jobs yes jobs is where we should have been all the time but letus have real jobs when we say we are going to replace welfare with jobs yes there is plenty of work to be done so we can do that and we understand that the work to be done is not a job until somebody agrees to pay for it you have to have a way to pay for it the government must decide it wants to repair roads and bridges the government must decide that it wants to t build schools the government must decide it wants to really clean up all the toxic waste sites across the country give out contracts to private enterprise it is all part of the economy as we go into the new world order it is different from the old world order in one basic respect we do not have the threat of an evil empire we do not have the threat of another superpower we do not live under the cloud of a nuclear war so we do not have to spend tremendous amounts of money half of our federal budget on defense and protection from war vehicles and instruments to make war that is the old world order you do not have to do that you do not have to spend that kind of money if we dedicate ourself to the proposition that in the new world order the federal government will spend as much money over the next 10 years on creating jobs and stimulating the economy as it did on defense in the last 10 years then you would have a transformation of american society you would not have a welfare problem of any mignitude you would end most of the problems relating to drugs and alcohol and a number of problems that very desperate people get into because they see no future they have no way to survive with dignity and we create problems by not allowing them an opportunityto earn an income an opportunity to survive with dignity i do not see why we could not adopt a proposition that the new world order is going to provide jobs for everybody i do not see why we could not have the proposition that we are going to spend as much to create jobs not all at once i am not a radical i am a very conservative guy i think we ought to have a policy of spending down on defense and as we spend down on defense the same amount of money should be spent up on economic stimulus you do not need all those additional weapons that are in the pipeline we do not need to keep paying for overseas bases in germany and japan we do not need all that anymore spend it down put it into a stimulus package spend it up and you will create more jobs yes the defense effort did create jobs the defense effort helped the economy it was a great stimulus many people argue that we should keep it going because it stimulutes the economy localities want their plants but reasonable human beings cannot argue that we should create more weapons of war in order to stimulate the economy we cannot stay with that argument very long let us do work that has to be done which is part of the agenda of the new world order we need more schools we need more equipment in those schools we need more hospitals we need a lot of things that can be created supported at the same time we stimulate the economy to create jobs so let us replace welfare with real jobs and to do that we are going to have to spend some money the basic question to ask about all the welfare reform bills that are being proposed and there are a number of them being proposed is will there be real job opportunities for the families we expect to work will we make work pay by creating jobs that leave families better off than they were on afdc and really help to lift the children and the families out of poverty we have just heard a long argument tonight one of many series of discussions on health care reform health care reform is absolutely necessary if you are going to have a new world order providing jobs for people and the jobs are going to be adequate an adequate job means it has to pay a salary which allows a person to live decently and at the same time it has to have at least one component of a benefits package it must have health care we must have health care along with a salary which meets the needs of a family so providing work does not mean a new slavery there are some people who have said well do not worry about it if you cannot find a job make them work off their grants let them go out and dig ditches make themwork it off well making them work it off at less than minimum wage and without health benefits means a new slavery we are going to become government slave owners we are going to have the largest plantation the world has ever seen by forcing people to work at less than minimum wage and without health benefits that is what we are proposing when we say it does not matter does not matter whether they can find a job or not we will make them work off their welfare grant no wewant real jobs let us replace welfare with real jobs let us save all the money we can save by getting rid of the subsidies that go to the rich the farmers the lawyers the grazing the mining the s ls let us stop being overly generous with flood victims earthquake victims hurricane victims especially the second time if they build a house near the water one time and it gets flooded do not rebuild it a second time with taxpayer money let us do the things that are necessary to transfer the money to the place where it is needed and where it is needed most is in the area of job stimulation a stimulus package which creates jobs real jobs all of america would benefit and we could hold our heads up high and understand that we have been fair we have been humane we lived up to the part of the constitution which requires us to promote the general welfare promoting the general welfare means promoting the general welfare for everybody i am going to close with a quote from an editorial in the new york times called common sense on welfare what they are doing in this editorial is commenting on recent polls that have been taken in relation to the welfare problem and the welfare reform proposals what they are saying is that congress may be out of step and some of the head hunters some of the intensely angry people who are going after welfare people in a hostile way are out of step with the american people that part of the reason congress is held in such low esteem may be the fact that congress refuses to go after the people with the farmers home loan mortgages 11 5 billion dollars worth of waste we do not go after that we come after the welfare recipients with a great deal of hostility let me read from the new york times editorial they are commenting on what these polls have shown in fact the public is sympathetic to major components of the serious welfare reform proposals now being considered majorities in the range of 80 percent to 90 perce nt of the public favor subsidizing child care for welfare mothers who go to work and guaranteeing that those who leave welfare do not lose their health insurance let me repeat that 80 to 90 percent of the american people favor subsidizing child care for welfare mothers who go to work and guaranteeing that those who leave welfare do not lose their health insurance to continue majorities favor a 2year limit on welfare benefits a 2year limit on welfare benefits is favored bythe majority of the american people research shows that most welfare recipients only stay on 2 years anyhow two years is not a bad limit if you do not apply it too arbitrarily because most welfare recipients do not stay on any more than 2 years and opinion is also unanimous in favoring tougher measures to collect child support from absentee fathers we are going to collect child support from absentee we are all in favor of that but the absentee fathers need jobs we ought to concern ourselves with stimulating the economy to provide jobs and maybe have incentives to say to absentee fathers here is a job for those who have not been paying the child support payments and we are going to collect from you when you get this job but it is incentive to go to work and i assure you most of the absentee fathers would respond by coming in to get the jobs i continue to quote from the new york times editorial but americans are also sympathetic to expanded education and job training benefits for welfare recipients americans are also sympathetic to expanded educationand job training benefits a large majority favor crating public service jobs for welfare recipients who cannot find work elsewhere the public worries about the impact of timelimited welfare on children that 2year rule they support on the one hand on the other hand they do not want to see children suffer as a result of kicking somebody off welfare after 2years and throwing the children into a situation where they cannot find housing on or be fair the public worries about the impact of time limitedwelfare on children nearly twothirds of americans say the government spends too little on poor children nearly twothirds of americans say that the government spends too little too little on children on poor children as the pollsters said in their report voters want welfare reform aimed at promoting work and strengthening families they will support new programs and even some new spending toward these ends provided they see personal responsibility and accountability being encouraged i want to repeat the public says that they will support new programs and even some new spending toward these ends provided they see personal responsibility and accountability being encouraged the public is angry about the welfare system but when it comes to finding solutions its emphasis is on practicality and concern for poor children the public is angry about the welfare system but when it comes to finding solutions its emphasis is on practicality and concern for poor children welfare reformers would do well to make the publics emphasis their own emphasis by implication congress would do well to listen to the public and instead of acting like mad dogs or sharks in a feeding frenzy blindly tearing away at the fabric of the welfare program to get at the poor congress should look at other subsidies broaden our concern with subsidies reform all subsidies at the same time we reform welfare and provide what is needed to take care of poor children and to provide the job training and most of all to stimulate the economy so that we crate jobs our civilization is dependent on our ability to guarantee work for everybody who wants to work not to guarantee the best possible job or the job everybody wants but a job where a person can make a living where a family can be fed the new world order ought to adopt that as a major goal the new world order ought to be willing to spend as much on creating the jobs stimulating the economy as we have spent in the last 10 years on defense the new world order ought to take responsibility for seeing to it that government and society is always superior to the jungle what we have done is thrown certain categories of people into the jungle when you have high unemployment no way to get a job then you are saying you are out there in the jungle by yourself you might as well act the way people act in the jungle or the way animals act in the jungle because we as a society are taking no responsibility for trying to provide an opportunity not to a handout but an opportunity to earn a living an opportunity to make income and an opportunity to take care of a family that is what welfare reform should strive to do that is what our whole society ought to consider we want to create maximum opportunity for everybody to earn a living all the other problems will begin to fall in place in large part if we provide a means to earn a living for every person who wants to work"], [0.5110384821891785, 0.48896151781082153, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding this time to me i rise in support of h r 51 the d c statehood bill the people of washington d c are no different than the people from any other state yet for purposes of citizenship they are treated differently they must bear the burdens of citizenship but they do not fully enjoy the benefits of citizenship like all other citizens they fight and die on foreign soil in defense of this nation they pay federal and local taxes to support the district and unitedstates governments and they are subject to the laws which govern us unlike all other citizens however the people of washington d c cannot vote for representatives in the house nor senators in the senate they are different they are denied the most basic right of this country i would ask members to consider how they would feel and what they would do if the citizens from their districts were in the position of the citizens from washington d c such could very well have been the case when we transcend the muddy waters of history we are reminded that generous offers came from all the original states to have the seat of government located on their land indeed for a 10year period from 1790 to 1800 the seat of government w~a temporarily located in the city i represent philadelphia pa if land from maryland and virginia had not been accepted by the founding fathers as the permanent seat of government citizens who today live on market or walnut street in philadelphia would be up in that gallery if our first president george washington had not surveyed the property situated on the potomac river the citizens of richmond va well represented by mr bliley could be up in that gallery today instead because of historical coincidence and government oversight the people of washington d c are forced to assemble up there and appeal to the members of congress for rights that all others take for granted dr martin luther king jr on one occasion reminded us that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere if we allow the injustice of secondclass citizenship to continue in the nations capital we imperil the

fits within its princlples there were dark days in this nations history when africanamericans were considered less than whole citizens we corrected that women were not equal we fixed that each time the constitution was expanded to include those previously left out it is a living breathing document it tolerates change and rejects clinging to the past when fundamental rights are at stake some who have full citizenship rights will say give the district back to maryland again the constitution reflects wisdom returning the district to maryland or retrocession as it is called can not be accomplished according to article 4 of the constitution without the consent of maryland and maryland will not consent some who are complete citizens will say the district is too small to be a state the genius of the constitution again is instructive small states are afforded the same rights as big states washington d c is larger than three of the current small states alaska wyoming and

amendment somehow stands in the way of d c statehood that argument has been soundly dismissed by a parade of constitutional scholars i urge my colleagues to rebuff phobia and embrace faith d c statehood will not destroy this nation it will help to rebuild it as full citizens district residents will display pride and honor the people of washington d c now pay more in federal taxes per person than all but two states they feed the federal treasury in excess of a billion dollars a year young men and women from washington d c have been present with our forces in vietnam the persian gulf somalia and off the shores of haiti in fact whenever we send troops to protect democracy around the world the district of columbia is represented and very often disproportionately d c statehood does not mean the end of the district of columbia the new smaller enclave will continue to serve the needs of the federal government the constitution permits a smaller capital for this nation the people of washington d c unlike the narrow majority in puerto rico want statehood status and most americans democrats and republicans want d c citizens to be treated the same as anyone else a noted justice of the unitedstates supreme court once warned us thou shalt not ration justice if we fail to pass this bill we will maintain a system of partial rights for some justice should not be for some and not for others the constitution does not permit that the word justice does not mean just us in the 50 states justice means equity fairness right truth justice demands that we pass this bill the constitution will endure nothing less but for the grace of god and an aberration of history you or i or any of us could be in that gallery today"]], "top_unsure": [[1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.49999988079071045, 1,
