also challenge as doctrinaire and simplistic mr stockmans position that monopolies can exist only with the support and encouragement of the government he has stated thatmonopoly never developed unless it is sanctioned by governmental authority there is no such thing as a privately developed and composed monopoly i also challenge mr stockmans overly aggrandized role of omb when he stated in response to the committees written questions that only omband i emphasize only ombis in a position to assess the relative importance of individual agency requests and strike a balance among the competing demands for federal resources that is consistent with the presidents fiscal policy what about the domestic policy group and the domestic policy staff at the white house and what about the president himself mr stockman is wedded to the kemproth tax cut i am concerned about the inflationary impact of kemproth and also its inequitable distribution of tax cuts as long as the reagan administration and mr stockman remain convinced of the merits of kemproth i am afraid we will see larger and larger deficits and a growing public debt and i must object to his definition of waste in government using the successful tjdag program as he does as his example few will dispute the propomiion that a consistent tough monetary program will help bring inflation under control but to look to that strategy alone is dangerously misleading and in the end could very well worsen conditions rather than inlprove them and there is no question that a restrictive monetary policy offers higher and higher interest rates in the short run these rates will subside only when inflation appears under control and the economy assumes a stable posture but the persistence of these high interest rates has crippled credit sensitive industries such as autos and housing the short run has been extended into a long and arduous timetable holding despair for businesses and their employees restrictive monetary policy canno

and government o perlyps a taxbased incomes policy th wageprice spiral represents the hard core inflation rate which now measures roughly 9 percent if we do not address this spiral we cannot hope to bring inflation to acceptable levels mr stocxman objects to the taxbased incomes polic as government interference but it is an innovative idea worthy of our consideration the complexities of the economy simply do not afford us the luxury of pursuing an antiinflation program with but a single weapon restrictive monetary policy let no one mistake or read into this a defense of socalled liberal economics which can be as doctrinaire and as simplistic as mr stockmans economics nor let anyone mistake what i am saying or not saying i am not saying we should not move to a balanced budget and i am not saying government is not part of our problem i am saying unlike the president and mr stockman that balancing the budget is not the only answer that there are other components to inflation than government deficit spending because i do not agree with his philosophy however i will not deny mr stockman my vote president reagan has an electoral mandate for his philosophy one strongly endorsed by mr stockman and we in the senate should allow him to seek to exercise that mandate this is the only way a president can be truly accountable to the peopleby being given a chance at least to offer to put into effect his campaign promises and pledges our duty in the selgate is to make sure that the presidents nominees are people of personal integrity experience and dedication mr stockman certainly meets these criteria and his views are consistent with the office to which he has been appointed mr president in conclusion while i find mr stockman to be certainly an acceptable nominee i summarize my concern by referring to his application of doctrinaire economics to the very complex ills of this country i am concerned that the price paid for a policy of stockmsans pure monetarisin as mrs thatcher has discovered will be paid by those least able to pay the poor the elderly the jobless and the total reliance on it will not cure our real ills in other words while i hope these concerns

amendment to that resolution that it would not tolerate budget reductions in the medicare program today i am introducing legislation which will asture the solvency of the medicare trust fund by injecting general revenues into that fund these general revenues would be generated by repeal of some of the most outrageous provisions of the internal revenue codethose relating to tax preferences for oil producers and royalty owners we have a moral commitment to the health of our nations older citizens and medicare is perhaps the most significant and important federal pro gram helping to fulfill that commitment today 26 million older persons and 3 million disabled persons depend on medicare to help meet their health care costs sixty percent of these beneficiaries are older women as important as medicare is it only meets between 33 to 40 percent of the health needs of older americans clearly significant reductions or added outofpocket costs for beneficiaries would be a tragedy for many of our neediest elderly and disabled citizens i believe it is the height of folly to look to reductions in medicare benefits in order to cut federal expenditures when at the same time we have wholesale giveaways to oil companies existing in our tax code there are a number of provisions some of which passed last year as part of the economic recovery tax act that have little if any economic justification and which should be repealed i am proposing that the revenue collected by closing these loopholes be specifically earmarked and directed to the federal hospital trust fund from which medicare is financed last year i joined the gentleman from new york peter peyser and 74 of my colleagues in proposing to repeal those sections of erta which amended the windfall profit tax act by exempting 2 barrels of oil per day3 starting in 1985for royalty owners reducing the tax on newly discovered oil from 30 to 15 percent over 5 years and exempting stripper oil by independent producers altogether from the windfall profit tax these three provisions will cost the treasury 1 962 billion in 1983 2 333 billion in 1984 and 2 995 billion in 1985 for a 3 year total of 7 29 billion the bill i am introducing today would also repeal these provisions these massive unjustified exemptions for royalty owners and producers were motivated by nothing more than pure political gamemanship certainly not by economics or sound energy policy in addition to the repeal of the erta provisions i am also proposing significant changes in two other provisions of the codethe percentage depletion allowance and the expensing of intangible drilling costs under percentage depletion independent producers and royalty owners are given an option accorded to no other taxpayers in our country they may choose cost depletion which is essentially like straight line depreciation available to all taxpayers holding capital assets or percentage depletion which allows a deduction of 18 percent of gross oil related iricome with certain restrictions since percentage depletion can be used for whatever number of years the oil well continues to produce we are left with the outrageous result that total deductions can far exceed the taxpayers investment if it could be demonstrated that percentage depletion led to greatly increased production of oil perhaps it could be justified however economists question whether percentage depletion has any stimulative effect at all on the production of oil even worse the drain on the treasury is tremendous 1 5 billion each year in 1983 and 1984 and 2 2 billion in 1985 for a 3year total of 4 2 billion another preference accorded the oil industry is the allowance of expensing for intangible drilling costs idcs include drilling shooting and cleaning the well draining road making stirveying and geological work in preparation for drilling construction of derricks tank pipelines necessary for drilling and preparatiop of the well for production in any other context costs like these would be treated as capital expenditures and depreciated over the useful life of the asset or perhaps some other reasonable fixed period of time which bears some relation to its useful life however idcs can be expensed in the first year which results in a tremendous tax deferral opportunity for the oil industry although the 1976 tax reform act restricted the use of idc expensing the tax preference is still very much in existence analysis by the joint economic committee has concluded that the major oil companies who comprise 70 to 75 percent of those using this device can absorb the increased tax without a shortage of capital if the expensing option were eliminated the cost to the treasury due to idc expensing is staggering 3 5 billion in 1983 7 7 billion in 1984 and 8 4 billion in 1985 for a 3year cost of 19 6 billion the total in foregone revenue represented by these provisions equals 6 962 billion in 1983 11 533 billion in 1984 and 13 595 billion in 1985 for a 3year grand total 32 09 billion all the figures i have cited were generated by the joint committee on taxation we have a very simple choice we can continue to waste over 32 billion over the next 3 years on tax breaks for the oil industry provisions which do little to stimulate oil production or energy independence or we can take that sum of money and invest it in our nations elderly and disabled helping them to live a more healthy life the house has spoken once already in adopting the oakar amendment declaring that the health care needs of our older citizens are important than reconstructing brokendown obsolete battleships i ask my colleagues to speak once again and pass this legislation demonstrating that our commitment to the elderly and disabled takes a

following the decline in the prime rate to 19 percent i believe it ought to be apparent to everyone here that economic events will run their course if we simply allow them to that does not mean tampering with shortterm stopgap measures or raising taxes or revising the next tax law or artificially propping up sagging industries it means balancing the budget by trimming deficits so that interest rates can fall thereby promoting further and more longlasting economic surges this member has on previous days over the course of the past 2 weeks taken some time at the close of our session and read from a study prepared for the republican research committees economic task force budget study subcommittee this subcommittee produced a work product in the latter part of july wherein we identified 272 itqms where savings could be made in fiscal year 1982 these totaled some 52 billion we are not necessarily su~ggesting that these items should all be implemented we are saying that if the congress would assert the courage in this institution to make the cuts necessary to balance the budget these items among others certainly should be considered on previous days i have read very briefly through items relating to legislative 21 cuts judiciary 8 cuts executive office 4 cuts funds for the president 15 cuts agriculture 27 cuts commerce 8 cuts defense military 15 cuts defense civil 4 cuts education 9 cuts energy 13 cuts and health and human services 16 cuts today i would propose to read through a list of cuts for housing and urban development totaling 15 for some 3 304 249 600 and in the department of the interior 6 cuts totaling 297 557 300 the first item from hud is housing programs subsidized housing in this category we would allow 20 percent above fiscal year 1980 the proposal as it is in the present law would provide for a 51 4percent increase over the preceding year moreover the gao finds considerable overcommitment of funds due to inaccuracies in contracts we believe this is excessive and should not be tolerated if adopted this would save 1 421 941 800 in housing programs payments for operation of lowincome housing projects we would cut 10 percent from 1981 these projects have been illadvised illconceived and illmanaged we propose eliminating operation of september 24 1 981 rrentarks e 4437 the most wasteful portions of those projects and achieve savings of 215 080 000 housing programs congregate services would be eliminated funding authority for this program has already been deleted and remaining outlays should follow suit this would save if adopted 5 300 000 housing programs troubled project operation subsidy we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the additional funding of housing projects is redundant if the worst offenders would be deleted we could remove that redundancy this would save if adopted 57 399 200 housing programs lowrent housing loans and expenditures we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the current proposal is for an increase of 173 5percent increase from 1980 which is altogether in our judgment unnecessary and unreasonable if implemented this would save 51 473 400 government national mortgage association special assistance functions we would improve this by following the recommendations of the general accounting office for improving accounting procedures which if adopted for this program would save 22 700 000 onma emergency mortgage purchase assistance we would improve the servicing of multifamily mortgages and provide incentives for prompt payments this again is a recommendation of the general accounting office if adopted it is estimated to save 500 million community planning and development community development support assistance wve would cut 10 percent from proposed funding for block grants not including udag these grants have helped corporations and developers not the needy this would save 411 300 000 community planning and development community development support assistance we would eliminate udag funding to decaying inner cities which should be redeveloped under the concept of enterprise zones not out of subsidies from the public treasury if implemented and adopted this would save 500 million new community development corporation we would eliminate funding for this program because we feel it can be better financed in creation of enterprise zones if adopted this would save 37 117 000 neighborhoods voluntary associations and consumer protection interstate land sales we would eliminate this on the grounds that the federal government should never have gotten in to this area to begin with and n addition this regulatory body has expanded into the intrastate field as well which certainly is not justified if implemented this would save 300 000 fair housing and equal opportunity we would eliminate this on the grounds that it is unnecessary it should not be functioning as a separate program but rather as policy if adopted this would save 6 100 000 management and administration public assistance and income supplement we would allow a growth of 20 percent above 1980 currently proposed spending represents a 5 1 8percent increase from 1980 which we believe to be excessive if implemented this would save 19 572 800 management and administration law enforcement activities we would allow a 20percent growth above 1980 the proposed increase is unnecessary because of cutbacks in enforcement activities if implemented this would reduce spending by 1 570 400 finally for this category we would follow the recommendation of the general accounting office by correcting auditing procedures which if implemented would save 54 395 000 in the department of the interior the first item here of the six that are proposed departmentwide we would correct auditing procedures recommended by the general accounting office which if implemented would reduce spending for this category by 59 510 000 land and water resources elm range improvement we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by limiting further land acquisition if implemented this would save 1 350 000 land and water resources blm resource management we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by restricting regulation and management if implemented this would reduce spending by 24 482 500 land and water resources elm miscellaneous permanent appropriation general purpose fiscal assistance we would allow 20percent growth above what was spent in 1980 the current proposal allows a 74 4percent increase from 1980 which we perceive as unwarranted this if adopted would save 201 515 600 land and water resources water and power resource service general administration we would allow 20percent above 1980 the proposed 50 1percent increase from 1980 is in our judgment excessive and should not be tolerated this if implemented would reduce spending in fiscal year 1982 by 8 899 200 land and water resources office of water policy salaries and expenses we would eliminate this new agency on the grounds that it is not needed there is little justification for its existence in our opinion this if implemented would reduce spending by 1 800 000 to sum up this category of the department of interior these six items would result in spending 297 557 300 less in fiscal year 1982 for the department of housing and urban development the 15 items total 3 304 249 600 some members in this chamber may from time to time ask the question if it is so simple why do we not do it that is why do we not balance the budget why do we not assert the necessary independence to bring the discipline to bear to match the outgowith the income and remove one of the great obstacles to economic recovery of this country the answer to that question is puzzling but it is probably more political than anything else there is a drum beat that runs through these chambers which says that if the members exhibit the courage to cut the spending this will1 aggravate those people and organizations adversely affected and these same special interests who are cut down or cut off will retaliate against the offending members in the voting booth that philosophy has been driving this institution for almost a generation it still is the controlling philosophy in this chamber then you may ask what hope is there for the people of this country if we who have the stewardship of raising taxes and voting spending do not have the courage to match the outgo with the income i think one constructive way is to demonstrate that we can balance the budget of this nation in fiscal year 1982 while at the same time providing for the recognized needs of the downtrodden the poor the handicapped and the deprived in our society because when you analyze these items that i have been reading i challenge members to stand up and honestly say that we cannot do that because if we adopted this or that item we would be working against the genuine interests of the poor the downtrodden the handicapped and the deprived those who do not have the ability to fend for themselves i say to the members here look at these items carefully we have prepared them in all sincerity we as an institution cannot go on year after year spending more money then we take in in this fiscal year which will close in less than a week we will have probably gone into debt roughly 90 billion in the last 5 years we have added to our national debt over 300 billion notwithstanding the election of november 1980 the spending of the congress of the united states is today out of control the members of this institution do not have the discipline at least as they have exhibited it up to now to match the outgo with the income i think the constructive thing for us to do is to demonstrate with a work product of this type that we can cut spending we can cut our bureaucracy we can cut out waste fraud and abuse i think it is reasonable to undertake this effort in a bipartisan way and try to bring some fiscal sanity into the affairs of this nation"],

nation under president jimmy carter and again under president ronald reagan i introduced legislation to establish a national space policy in the hopes of promoting the development of a coherent longrange national space policy but the newly announced national space policy released on july 4 1982 by the president at the landing of the final test flight of the shuttle can be said at best to be a treading water policy and at worst and more accurately stated a strictly militarily inspired space policy which neglects the civilian economic and technological needs of the nation the heavyhanded priority placed on the military uses of space comes as no surprise but the blatant and unabashed use of the civilian space agency the national aeronautics and space administrationnasa for department of defense purposes is unprecedented and a shocking departure from the past with the growing use of the space shuttle for national security missions nasa as has been said before will operate much like a trucking agency for the pentagon sadly this new space policy merely articulates what has been feared to be this administrations policy in regard to space programs funding for dod space programs for the first time this year is equal to nasas entire budget in future years defense spending in space is scheduled to exceed nasa spending while nasa will spend a significant portion of its budget on military applications what is left of the space program when the military emphasis is accounted for is a shrunken and if we are lucky a static space program the benefits provided this country economically through space technology spinoffs through jobs and through improvements throughout sectors of our societyspanning agriculture communications medicine energyare unparallelled in any other federal programs to turn our back on the fundamental economic strength represented by our countrys scientific leadership in the name of national security is in my view a form of hypocrisy it is also bad economic policy some of my colleagues may call me harsh overreactive or just plain wrong a casual reader of the space policy will note correctly that there are provisions in the policy for a civil space progi m along with the space transportaticn program and the national security space program but surely program funding is a better way than policy statements to determine where the administrations priorities lie and if this years budget debate is any indication the administrations priority is in military uses of space indicative of the new emphasis on the military uses of space is the choice of the chairman for the senior interagency group on space sig announced in the space policy on july 4 the sig is established to provide a forum to all federal agencies for their policy views to review and advise on proposed changes to national space policy and to provide for orderly and rapid referral of space policy issues to the president space policy issues will be referred to the president by its chairman the assistant to the president for national security affairs the administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration is listed as a member of sig there is no doubt of the military bias for the uses of outer space i was as proud as any american on our lastest launch and landing of the space shuttle but if the defense establishment takcs over the shuttle as it is likely to can risking the rest of the space program be justified in the name of national security the threat of closing a superb laboratory such as the jet propulsion laboratory in calltornia or the lewis laboratory has been floated as a possible way of offsetting the budget cuts to protect the shuttle the venus orbiting imaging radar project was canceled and the galileo jupiter mission is not assured cuts in research and analysis have hit the planetary sciences hardest although the feared and rumored cancellation by the administration of the planetary programs did not occur perhaps the cuts in the planetary program indicate best where the administrations priorities are and where it has gone wrong despite its past successes and the inspiration and national pride this program fosters the planetary program is in serious trouble and is getting no better there were 38 lunar and planetary launches in the 1960s 14 in the 1970s and with the cancellation of the venus orbiting imaging radar 1 approved mission for the 1980s in 5 years there has been no new program successfully initiated adjusting for inflation the fiscal year 1983 budget for planetary programs is twothirds the expenditures of 5 years ago but cutbacks in programs do not reflect the whole story with regard to the presidents space policy clearly lacking in the policy is an aggressive highchallenge space engineering initiative such as a permanent space station operating in low earth orbit the ii 10 15 omission is a perplexing one as such a space station has been considered a logical next step in our space efforts however this type of activity will not just happen by itself it will take the kind of commitment and vision that a space policy should prcvide and which was not provided in this new policy the administrator of nasa james beggs was surely disappointed in the lack of any mention of a space station only 10 days before the president announced his policy mr beggs in a speech in michigan said i believe that our next logical step is to establish a permanent manned presence in lowearth orbit this can be done by developing a manned space station we think that such a station could be built and placed in orbit by 1990 now that we have the space shuttle we owe it to the nation to make optimum use of this new capability in fact the shuttle program was originally conceived to include a space station it is difficult to imagine an initiative such as this one being carried out under the lowkeyed space policy similarly lacking was any initiative regarding the exploitation of our satellite capabilities on the contrary the administration has in the past stated its intention of transferring the landsat program to the private sector while failing to provide any plan for accomplishing this objective i am not convinced that the administrations goal to transfer landsat is a reasonable one i feel strongly that there is an important role for the government to play in the area of remote sensing i offer the conclusions and recommendations of the house subcommittee on space science and applications calling for a global resource information system as an example solutions to many global concerns such as threats to the ozone layer the carbon dioxide problem and global air and water pollution as well as global mineral and energy exploration would benefit from the existence of such a system some of these objectives might be met by involvement of the private sector as emphasized in the presidents space policy but others such as observation of the ozone layer or the carbon dioxide problem would most appropriately be the responsibility of the federal government much as i regret having to state it in such terms this administrations space policy can be likened to early european imperialism where economic exploitation is achieved by the use of superior technology and guaranteed by the use of force rather than cooperation such a policy cannot work in a world where new generations of technology develop every 10 years the united states cannot be sure of its technological superiority although we generally see a correlation between where we spend our money and where we get results we are spending our money on weapons systems and other national security projects while cutting our support for civilian uses of space two results are likely first increased tensions and an accelerated arms race and second a decline in our economic posture with a loss of markets to our economic competitors it does not have to be this way we can keep and strengthen the measures to keep the arms race out of space we can negotiate an antisatellite warfare treaty rather than unilaterally try to dominate space militarily we can continue to lead the world technologically in the peaceful uses of space and finally we could show a touch of greatness as befits a great power in sharng this wealth of knowledge with others in the pursuit of human progress"],

voter participation is the product of several factors the elections were held largely in cities under the control of mayors appointed by the junta people who have a personal stake with an interest in generating the greatest voter turnout possible failure of the mayors to do so might have been seen as an indication of insufficient commitment to the junta and the military with predictable

their rejection of violence the election however does not mean that el salvador has a democracy the united states cannot regard elections during a civil war by a repressive government as the means by

under which this election was held or to believe that the election has ended them the cornerstone of the reagan administration policy on el salvador has been that the march 28 elections would produce an election victory for the christian democratic party and for president jose napolean duarte the administration sought support in congress and among the american people for continued and increasing military and economic aid to the government of el salvador on the grounds that the aid was necessary to strengthen the moderate civilian elements within the ruling junta the commitment of the christian democratic party to social and economic reform was used to justify a policy of unitedstates intervention and support for a rightwing oppressive military guilty of gross violations of human rights that unitedstates policy suffered from a fatal defect in that president duarte and the christian democratic party did not have control over the military the defense minister gereral garcia controls the military but duarte did not and does not control garcia after my visit to el salvador in february i had serious reservations about holding an election in a country locked in a civil war i believed that it was essential to end the killing and the violence first then through negotiations bring all political parties into the elections process and then to hold elections in an atmosphere of peace time and time again our congressional delegation heard how elections had been used in the past to legitimatize a repressive right wing government in 1972 the military deprived president duarte of his rightful victory in the presidential election i became concerned that even if president duarte won this election the outcome would not alter the fundamental defect in the duarte governmentthe inability of civilian moderate forces to exercise control over the military my fear was that the election would legitimatize the de facto control that gen jose guillermo garcia exercises over the government and the people the election however did not produce the result around which the state department had structured unitedstates policy while the christian democratic party won over 40 percent of the vote the majority of the 60 seats in the legislative assembly will be held by right wing parties the extreme right wing nationalist republican alliance arena founded only last year by roberto daubuisson will be the second largest party with approximately 29 percent of the seats the right wing parties will now attempt to form a coalition government to exclude president duarte and the christian democrats the reagan administration will attempt to insure that some christian democrats are included in any new government the administration may also succeed in persuading the right wing coalition not to make daubuisson leader of a coalition government the administration correctly recognizes that it would be impossible for it to obtain support in congress for a government in which daubuisson is either the leader or highly visible the coalition government will not be any more deserving of military assistance from the united states if daubuisson is not a member of the government we should not delude ourselves into believing that all will go well daubilission is excluded from the government we should not think that our policy in el salvador suddenly went wrong only on sunday because duarte did not receive a majority of the votes our policy was wrong before then and is wrong now because it has emphasized support for the military in el salvador over civilian reformist elements within the government and among the people because the united states has failed to insist that the government of el salvador meet the conditions on aid imposed by congress in the foreign assistance act of 1981 as a result of my visit to el salvador i was convinced of the wisdom of the conditions that we in the congress imposed upon that aid we required among other conditions that the government of el salvador make a goodfaith effort to enter into negotiations with all political factions within el salvador that the government make progress toward ending the abuse of human rights by the military the conditions set in law by congress would constitute a sound basis for unitedstates policy in el salvador the united states cannot lose sight of the longrange implications of our policy in that country we cannot give elections in el salvador the same value that we would give to elections in the united states we cannot pretend that an election in el salvador forms the same basis for legitimate government that an election in the united states does our country enjoys longestablished democratic institutions americans were holding democratic elections in the united states before there was actually a united states such elections have almost never been held in el salvadorperhaps twice in its entire history i urge the house the congress the american people to reaffirm their commitment to human rights as a basis for unitedstates policy in el salvador i would very much like to see the united states persuade whatever government is formed in el salvador to undertake negotiations necessary to end the civil war through a political solution my concern is for the people of el salvador who have been the victims of violence from both the right and the left i am deeply concerned however that a coalition of rightwing parties will attempt to win a military victory that will escalate tremendously the violence within el salvador the real victims of such escalation will not be the forces of the leftwing or the rightwing they will be the inno cent the young the old women and children i do not believe that the united states should be providing arms that will be used to kill those innocent victims that concern should be fundamental to our policy whether the president of el salvador is jose napolean duarte or roberto daubuisson or some other person i ask unanimous

in our nations wilderness system although the bill lacks certain provisions which i would have preferred to see included such as clarification of the status of certain lands outside the wilderness system i nevertheless supported this legislation in committee and i vote for it today because of a strong personal belief that congressionally designated wilderness areas should be offlimits to oil and gas leasing and development at this time this has been my position for more than a year dating back to the disclosure that hundreds of lease applications had been filed on wilderness lands including wyomings washakie wildernessa 686 584acre region in northwestern wyoming adjacent to yellowstone national park which was set aside by congress several years ago as a component of the national wilderness preservation system our national parks and wilderness areas are special places which deserve preservation and protection from development i believe and i think most people agree that oil and gas development could be potentially destructive to the physical characteristics of these areas and that it would be incompatible with the esthetic and scenic attributes which motivated the congress in the first place to single out these areas for special status therefore i strongly support that portion of h r 6542 which prohibits leasing in designated wilderness areas this action will place the congress clearly on record ending the speculation and uncertainty that currently previals as to the legal responsibilities of the government under the 1964 wilderness act with respect to leasing in wilderness areas at the same time i wish to make clear my disappointment that the committee refused when considering this legislation to provide the same kind of clear guidance and management certainty with regard to lands which have been studied for wilderness potential but not included in the wilderness system for too long too much land has remained in uncertain management status in the wake of the forest services rare i and rare ii wilderness inventories this legislation should have addressed this problem attempts to raise this legitimate area of concern during committee consideration of the bill were ruled nongermane thus precluding a full and open discussion and a vote on the record the point is that the purpose of this legislation is to prevent leasing and development in areas set aside by congress as wilderness however the bill withdraws from leasing not only designated areas but also propsed areas and lands under study which may eventually be proposed as wilderness pending congressional action on their status yet there is nothing in the bill that would impel the congress to determine the wilderness status of these lands in a timely fashionsuch as a date in the future on which these lands would again become available for leasing in the event of congressional inaction in other words certain lands are withdrawn without benefit of congressional decision as to whether or not they should be added to the wilderness system and certain other lands could automatically be withdrawn from leasing merely by virtue of their being recommended for designation as wilderness at the end of a study process congress needs to fulfill its responsibility to make a decision one way or the other on the wilderness status of these lands so that they can be considered in the forest planning process and managed according to their particular attributes instead these lands are in management limbo in an effort to address this problem of management uncertainty in my own state i have joined with wyomings two senators to introduce the wyoming wilderness act of 1982 our wyoming bill has three major objectives first like the bill we are considering today it would withdraw all congressionally designated wilderness areas in wyoming from leasing in this regard our bill goes a step further than the lujanseiberling bill by also withdrawing wyoming wilderness areas from operation of the mining laws subject to valid existing rights effective upon enactment second our bill would add several hundred thousand additional acres of national forest lands in wyoming to the wilderness system and third it would release remaining forest lands from their current uncertain status and include them in the forest planning process it is the hope of the wyoming congressional delegation that our bill can be enacted yet this year i would like to make one other point about wyomings contributions both to the nations wilderness system and to the effort to achieve energy sufficiency currently about 25 percent of wyomings national forest system has been designated as wilderness more than 2 million acres of some of the nations most spectacular wilderness country is in wyoming and if the wyoming congressional delegations bill is enacted our contribution to the wilderness system will increase by several hundred thousand acres we in wyoming are proud of our national parks and wilderness areas and we mean to preserve and protect them we are also proud of our contribution to the nations energy supply for many years the oil and gas resources of wyoming have helped fuel the american economy and they continue to do so there are enormous coal resources in wyoming which we have only begun to tap there are extensive uranium deposits and a variety of other important minerals since half of wyoming is owned by the federal government most of these resources lie beneath federally owned landsnational forest and bureau of land management lands it is the view of most wyoming people that we should continue to encourage the development of these resources which contribute to the nations enermy security and benefit the economy of the state it is also the view of most people that wyomings national parks and wilderness areas which comprise less than 10 percent of the states land should be protected from development these lands should be offlimits to leasing and that is why i support the legislation before us today the remaining federally owned lands in wyoming should be managed according to the several laws already on the books and according to their particular attributes for many areas that should mean allowing leasing and others kinds of public uses but the land planning and management re sponsibilities of the various landmanaging agencies cannot be met until congress fulfills its responsibility to make a decision on the status of federally owned lands the bill before us today represents one important decision that wilderness areas will be offlimits to mineral leasing now it is time for congress to get on with the job of determining the status of millions of acres still in limbo"],

been leveled flat eliminating distinctions between managers and those they manage that is no way to run a government or hold superior talent with executive pay now capped at 50 112 a year senior managers are fleeing federal service programs in health education and space exploration seem typically hard hit whereas 15 5 percent of eligible executives retired in 1978 the current rate is above 90 percent replac ing them is no easier than holding them the problem is rooted in politics to cam ouflage its own pay raises congress over the years contrived to link its salary scales to those of the top people in the juicial and executive branches but it also prohibited almost all of these officials from earning more than a member of congress now the cost of that folly is coming home the legislators are embarrassed to raise their own pay while they cut most federal budgets and so some of the best talent in government is deprived and driven away the house debate of the issue is not promising it turns on a bill that would merely extend the cap for another year the case for a fundamental change has never been stronger but if that is rejected congress should at least provide some

we are debating is something far more profound and far reaching the decisions we make today combined with those to be made in the other body will have a deep and his tonec effect on our future as a power for peace in the mideast the heart of this issue is not awacs technology but foreign policy not the security of one type of aircraft but thb security of our nation the western alliance and our friends in the mideast let us look at some of the questions before us some say we should not give the saudi the awacs unless there are americans to man them others question the alleged insecurity of the awacs technology in saudi hands i recall a story i heard the other day a highranking administration of ficial was being questioned by a distinguished member of the other body about the awacs deal the administration official said to the senator if the saudi dont buy awacs from us theyll simply turn around and buy a similar plane from the british and the senator replied let them buy it from the british if thats what they want and so the administration official said if you have no objection to the saudi pos jessing the technology as such why not let the united states make the sale instead of great britain and the senators reply to that was my time is up and i have no further questions ~ a vote against this sale is not going to deprive the saudi arabians of sophisticated flying radar technology is there anyone who doubts the capacity of the british nimrod to eventually perform awacs tasks does anyone doubt the saudis will buy the nimrod it is only a matter of money and the saudis have plenty of that if the saudis buy nimrods there will be no joint control of the plane so what are we gaining by forcing the saudis into a situation which deprives usof any chance of influencing the use of this technology is awacs a threat to israeli security of course not the israelis know perfectly well the saudis and other arab nations cannot mesh technologles in such a way that the saudi awacs could direct arab aircraft in a war against israel may i add one more point concerning the security question for over 30 years the united states of america has been sending our most sophisticated weapjons systems to the state of israel but since the creation of the state of israel there has not been a single day when anyone could guarantee the survival or security of israel they have always lived on the brink of destruction for over 30 years we have been told we must give israel every new weapon system it wants because it is in constant danger of disaster but suppose we had replied we cannot give israel high technology equipment because israels security is threatened we risk capture of our stateoftheart weapons technology israels security from invasion is too unstable to trust them with sophisticated weaponry which might fall into the wrong hands would not such an argument be missing the point in giving threatened israel sophisticated weaponry for over 30 years we have not taken counsel of our fears we have instead followed our commonsense that israels possession of high technology equipment is in our interests despite the risks it could possibly fall into enemy hands the same argument should hold true when it comes to saudi arabia the united states should not base its policy on fear but on selfinterest we are told that the fate of the shah of iran is a warning to us all do not sell sophisticated equipment to an autocratic ruler in the mideast because it will fall into the hands of our enemies the only thing wrong with such an argument is that it is based on a totally false analogy the iranians and the arabs are different people with different histories different customs different forms of government and different geopolitical roles the shah tried to force feed irans military modernization process thereby alienating many iranians the sadidis have used 72 to 90en of its military agreements with the united states to buy construction services infrastructures training and other elements the shah was opposed by irans religious leaders the saudi family faces no such opposition and is in fact closely tied to the religious leaders the shah changed leadership in his armed forces so often there was complete chaos the saudis have had great stability and continuity in its command structure and ministerial leadership since the 1060s so the analogies with iran are simply false we have an entirely different situation in saudi arabia what about the alleged threat to internal security from the millions of foreign workers who are in saudi arabia that threat cannot be dismissed lightly but it also cannot logically stand in the way of the sale if an internal threat to the saudi kingdom is so great that our awacs will be threatened the disaster will go beyond the mere capture or destruction of awacs it will engulf all of saudi arabia itself the loss of awacs will be the least of our worries besides if such a massive and imminent threat exists it wtll occur before we sell the awacs and if the danger is not immediate how can we predict what is going to happen in 1985 or 1090 the united states is irrevocably tied to saudi arabia for the foreseeable future economically and geopolitically our two nations hay mutual interests we may not like it some of our constituents may not like it mr begin certainly does not like it but like it or lump it the saudis need us and we need them i am not one of those who say we should be nice to the saudis because they allegedly hold down the price of oil we all know they charge exactly what is in their longrange interests no we should act only in our selfinterest and yes i am as irritated as anyone over the saudi reluctance to cooperate with american strategic initiatives in the mideast they have been uncooperative when it comes to the question of american forward bases and our role in regional security but it stands to reason that not selling them awacs will not make them any more cooperative it will only make matters worse what about the concerns of many americans over the effect this sale will have on the state of israel as one who believes that israel is vital to the national security interests of the united states i am convinced i 7ils figure comes from saudi arabia awacs and americas search for strategic stability in the near east a publication of the international security studio program of the wilson center smithsonian institute building washington d c by all the available evidence this sale will not endanger the security of israel nobody is asking israel and saudi arabia to like each other we are not running a computer dating service for mideast lonely hearts all wve are saying is that despite mutual dislike those nations have common enemies that can destroy either or both helping the saudis will not harm israelunless israel decides to perceive such help as harmful and we should not make policy based on the perceptions of other countries saudi arabia will not go away the geopolitical problems of the mideast will not vanish the hard strategic decisions will not suddenly be solved by denying awacs to the saudis our two nations are bound together like contestants in a thrceeegged race at a picnic we may be uncomfortable together we may stumble and find fault with each other but we have to learn to move together or else we both will lose summing up we find that every argument presented against this sale has no foundation in fact the awacs will not be a threat to israel but the nimrod might be a threat according to findings of the senate foreign relations committee joint control of the awacs does not guit the saudis but if they buy nimrod there wvill be no joint control and americans will have absolutely no voice in how the information is used we are told that awacs cannot help the saudis against soviet attack that is absolutely correct but it can help the saudis against air attacks from soviet client states you cannot logically argue that awacs is good enough to threaten israel and then argue it is not good enough to help defend the saudis from attack but that is exactly what opponents of this sale have argued voting against awacs will not stop the saudis from gaining awacstype technology all it will do is insure that we do not have a part in selling the technology training the crews and

convinced that the proposed sale of our airborne warning and control system aircraft e3as would be contrary to the interests of the united states let us set aside for the moment the question of how this sale would impact the security of the only stable democracy in the region our staunch ally israel i submit that it is not in our nations best interests to supply these command aircraftthe most sophisticated surveillance planes in the unitedstates arsenalto a potentially unstable country in a region as volatile as the middle east just last week we were witness to tragic proof of the violence and terror that hangs so heavily over that region for those who scoff at the concern over the stability of the saudi regime let me respectfully point out that we engaged in a similar debate in 1977 on the question of whether to sell awacs planes to another kingdom in that region at that time the monarch requesting the aircraft was the shah of iran while we were assured by the previous administration that iran wvas a pillar of stability future events showed just how unpredictable that tumultuous area is fortunately that transaction was not consumated if it had been the highly sensitive awacs technology would have been in all probability compromised along with the other unitedstates equipment that was left behind including our f14 fighter planes while i certainly do not predict any revolution in saudi arabia similar to that of its neighbor we must not be blind to the possibility of any upheaval fully onethird of the population in the saudi kingdom is foreign including large concentrations of palestinians and yemnenis which provides for a potentially foreigninspired internal conflict last weeks despicable assassination in egypt but another incident in the long history of violence and revolution in the middle east in recent years many uprisings have been directed against monarchiesa source of no consolation for the saudis indeed even popular leaders were not immune to attack the contemptible killers who murdered president anwar sadat are thought to be members of a moslem fundamentalist group last thursday the egyptian government had to quell a violent uprising of moslem insurrectionists in asyut 250 miles south of cairo the militant islamic movement has been growing in strength during recent years and is a source of concern for the majority of countries in the region irrespective of their eastwest alinement and if it is believed that the religious saudi regime is immune to these fanatics i respectfully remind my colleagues of the armed takeover of the grand m~osque in mecca holiest of all sites to moslems 2 years ago adm stansfield turner former director of the cia wrote in the washington post on april 23 1981 thatit would be irresponsible for us to help them prepare to defeat a sophisticated air threat for which the awacs was designed and which has a low probability of occurring when they are incapable of handling the elementary threats of insurrection and guerrilla warfare that are highly probable it is clear that there exists a very real thrept to government stability in the region and it is therefore unwise to allow another country to possess awacs aircraft without the guarding presence of americans the possibility of the compromise of awacs technology is an unacceptable risk there are some who downplay this fear stating that the awacs technology is by now quite old yet according to our cia the soviets could move ahead 5 to 7 years in certain capabilitites if they were to capture an awacs plane according to gen george keegan former chief of air force intelligence even if you downgrade the equipm~ent and leave only the 1960 radar technology which the state department is now characterizing as an ancient radar technology the fact nevertheless remains that the radar aboard that aircraft the basic radar and the basic original computer system du es constitute the most powerful radar system ever put into an aircraft our technological edge is one of our few military advantages over the soviet union why then should we risk narrowing that gap at this time an important consideration in this debate is the threat that the sale would pose to the security of israel we have all heard the argument that the awacs would not be any g anger to israel because they could be easily jammed or shot down that unfortunately is not the case gen david jones chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has said all the experts will agree that the awacs radar is the hardest to jam that has ever been built furthermore the awacs are designed to be effective flying 150 miles or more behind the battle lines with its advanced warning radar they would be difficult to attack in any surprise raid and if protected by our f15 fightersand we must bear in mind that the administration is also proposing to sell advanced sidewinder airtoair missiles for the saudis formidable f15s the best fighter aircraft in the worldthe awacs would not be any sitting ducks the capabilities of the awacs are undeniably a significant threat to israels security interests as long as saudi arabia continues to view israel as her primary enemy we have no choice but to assume that all of the saudis military strengths are potential threats to israel the addition of awacs planes along with refueling capability and sidewinder missiles for the f15s would dramatically alter the current m~ilitary balance given israels relatively small size its location and population it has historically relied upon the element of surprise and preemptive strikes to compensate for the overwhelming advantage of its arab adversaries the awacs presents a clear threat to this strategy and to israels air superiority one caninot ignore the possibility that the important command control capability of the awacs could be used to coordinate arab air attacks my opposition to this sale does not imply that i disregard saudi security concerns saudi arabia is a nation of critical importance to the united states the saudis desire to protect their oilfifelds is wellfoundedwitness the damage to oil installations in the ongoing war tetweeen iran and iraq yet saudi purchase of awacs aircraft would not increase the security of the fields beyond that now provided by the current arrangement in which awacs jointly staffed by saudi and united states personnel patrol the persian gulf area no other nationnot even any of our closest nato alliesis permitted to operate awacs without american presence nor have we ever sold this advanced aircraft to any other nation the saudis though have decided that the present arrangement is an insult to their sovereignty they further state that this sale is a litmus test of our friendship that is not any valid reason to approve the transfer of our most sophisticated surveillance craft we must not allow such proclamations to pave the way for other countries to act similarly there have been controversial arms sale proposals scrutinized by congress in the past and there will be more in the future it is the responsibility of the congress to fulfill our duties of investigation and oversight we must not be deterred in our determination of the best interests of the united states by intimidating statements from proposed recipients as for the view that we should give the saudis a special favor to increase their strength as a moderating influence in the arab world i ask how effective are they in lessening the extremism of libya iraq algeria or syria and what of the saudis own policies the wall street journal reported on september 16 19081 that in politics the saudis are arab moderates because unlike libya or iraq they dont invade their islamic neighbors and of course because they talk an antisoviet line but like the soviets they supply money and rhetorical support to the terrorist palestine liberation organization at the time of camp david they cast their lot against egypts president sadat in doing this they also undermined unitedstates policy for that matter in 1973 they singled out the united states as the object of an oil embargo better surely to have a saudi arabia led by the house of saud than by a fundamentalist mullah or a marxist colonel but this is not a special friend to whom the united states owes great favors finally i feel that it is unwise to proceed with the sale at th is part icular time in light of last tuesdays october 6 tragic events in egypt the heinous murder of president sadat will have profound consequences for the delicate balance of forces in the middle east we must not be brash in our action at this crucial periodthe only prudent course is for the united states to wait and see how this catastrophic situation develops it would be an act of undue haste to proceed with the proposed sale of weapons to saudi arabia before the full impact of the horrible event is known in summarizing my remarks i stress again that it is in the interests of tile united states to insure the stability of saudi arabia but do not feel that this proposed sale willl accomplish that objective further the risk of compromising awacs technology is unacceptable especially when one considers that the augmented risk would not be accompanied by any gain in the protection of the saudi oilfields and we must recognize that this proposed sale would seriously impact the security of isreal our only constant ally in the region it is for these reastris that i oppose the sale and urge my colleaguez to vote for this resolution of disajroval this proposed sale to saudi arabia was a mistaken carter initiative let us not compound that erroneous policy"], [0.00013360381126403809, 0.49986639618873596, 1, "today i rise to introduce a bill that will enhance americas energy future and national security the bill i am introducing today the department of defense renewable energy utilization act addresses these important national concerns by giving the dod a greater role in reshaping its own energy needs and consumption patterns there is no more serious threat to the longterm economic and military security of the united states than that which stems from the growing deficiency of secure and assured energy resources the 1973 arab oil embargo alerted all americans but particularly the military to the vulnerability of their dependence on petroleum products americas lifeline and its achilles heel is oil unfortunately this dangerous dependency carries on into the military sector the dod cannot afford to be immobilized by interruptible supply lines dependent on foreign nationis whims or crippling energy costs that work to divert valuable defense dollars to fuel costs and not to improving our military preparedness i refer to the dod annual report for fiscal year 1982 january 1981 which acknowledges that inflation can steal defense purchasing power and thereby damaging the national security thus it is counterproductive not to have the dod participate more directly in meeting its energy needs meeting these energy needs is just as important as deciding whether to build the bi bomber or how many tanks should be purchased in fiscal year 1983 dod cannot move its tanks or jet thrcraft nor power its buildings or equipment without energy unfortunately these energy needs are being primarily met by petroleum products mainly because of the demand by aircraft and ships some 81 percent of dods total energy needs must be met by petroleum products obviously there is little room for using innovative alternative energy sources to meet the energy requirements of dods transportation sector renewables where applicable would provide the proper mechanism for giving dod an inexhaustible and reliable energy source for its electrical power generation needs the dod renewable energy utilization act establishes the appropriate mechanism for dod to acconiplish this important task by accelerating the commercialization of solar and other renewable technologies program goals of industry growth innovation promoting small business development and the facilitation of early transition to sustaining markets are just and a few of the benefits to be derived from the renewable energy act through these efforts of multiyear purchases we will be able to assure private industry that the proper market assurances of large numbers of energy equipment will be provided so that they will be willing to invest in the appropriate production equipment and research and developmeat required for innovation these large nearterm markets will provide it with a proper market stimulus for costreducing innovations through mass production so that newer energy technologies can compete with conventional energy equipment in this manner the renewable energy act can do for photovoltaics and other renewable technologies what the space program did for the semiconductor industry president reagan has made it quite clear that he will hold true to his campaign promise to dismantle doe thus effectively removing from the energy scene a previously important participant in this area therefore without dod help the achievement of technological developments that need to take place before photovoltaics and other renewvable energy alternatives can become cost competitive with electricity from other sources will be slowved down dramatically postponing these major scientific breakthroughs does not make sense at a time when the solar industry desperately needs assistance from the federal government and particularly needs to cure the federal government of its schizophrenic treatment of renewables i think it behooves the administration and the dod to support congress efforts to demonstrate to the amnerican people not only the seriousness of ou energy problems but also what alternatives are available and can be stimulated by proper government action and policy furthermore it is shortsighted to suggest that the costs of demonstrating these technologies through the dodas some critics of renewable energy sources believeoutweighs the importance of getting them into the energy stream as quickly as possible it is not an embarrassing situation for the dod to get involved in energyrelated activities to me it makes good sense to tap dod resources and its disciplined approach to solving problems for energyrelated advances that they stand to directly benef it from defenserelated programs are the dominant consumers of fuel in the federal sector excluding purchases for the strategic petroleum reserve the pentagon purchases were approximately 97 percent of federal fuel purchases in the first half of fiscal year 1980 and 94 percent in fiscal year 1979 the defense departments fuel purchases amounted to 4 billion in fiscal year 1979 while this figure jumped dramatically to an average of 7 5 billion to 9 billion in fiscal year 1980 it is obvious that in order to effectively reduce the dods fuel bill congress and the pentagon must join together in a strong united front to move the pentagon much more quickly away from its overall dependence on petroleum products and into energy systems that promote energy conservation and the use of alternate energy sources these efforts must be accelerated during the next few years by the defense department taking the lead in utilizing promising alternate energy sources for military application the pentagons efforts will result not only in reducing its consumption of petroleum products but its experience and the accompanying technolo3gical spinoffs will be adaptable to the needs of the civilian world as well this will assure a growing market for energy systems powered by solar and other renewable forms of energy and will hasten the general commercial residential industrial agricultural and governmental use of such systems in the united states and abroad surely the dod has the motive and perhaps more importantly it has the ability to provide a market of sufficient size and if need be it can uinderwrite prices there is every reason to support the pentagon as the lead agency in energyuse production in this country this course of action will not take it away from its defenserelated activities this realistic approach was even recognized by former defense secretary clark clifford who said that americans have a right to demand that the pentagon should use its economic power to help solve those domestic problems which are important to our total national security along this vein one renewable energy source that has a promising career with the dod is photovoltaics simple devices with a projected lifetime of over 20 years photovoltaicssolar cells which covert sunlight directly into electricitywere first used on space satellites of the 1960s at a cost of 250 000 per wvatt but as in other semiconductor technologies such as pocket calculators continued advances in materials research and manufacturing processes have dramatically reduced thle cost of photovoltaic systems it is encouraging to note that today this cost has fallen to only 10 to 12 per peak watt thus making them cost competitive with dieselfired electric generators in remote site applications hopefully the mideighties will herald the appearance of the 1 60 to 2 20perpeakwatt photovoltaic module with dod creating a large neartermi market stimulus for costreducing innovations through mass production these lowered costs will be a big boost to tilphotovoltaic industry a task force on solar energy comimercialization released by the dod in 1977 entitled dod photovoltaic energy conversion systems market inventory and analysis stated that phiotolvoltacs offer a number of advantages to the dod in addition to potential cost and fuel savings photovoltaic energy systems would provide the dod a highly reliable silent power source allowing virtually unattended operation in most areas of the world near term benefits to the dod inelude cost and logistics savings at remote sites in portable equipment and offshore applications the unitedstates would also receive national benefits from accelerated commercialization of photovoltaics over tile longer term photovoltaic energy systems will offer thle nation a cost competitive source of commercial electric power of provide a userowned dispersed source of power thus reducing dependence on foreign energy sources other national benefits include the development of exports to underdeveloped countries where photovgltaic systems would be utilized for rural electrificeatilon and irrigation pumping thus the potential market for p v and p vthermal systems consists of installations and specialized energy requirements at remote sites for offshore uses and for portable equipment in terms of total energy consumption installations are the prime market p v systems are likely to prove cost effective for use in these specialized applications several years before they become coinpetitive with commercial electrical power onl a unit cost basis the potential high reliability low maintenance requirements quiet operation long lifetime and modular character of p v energy systems make them a desirable alternative for these applications dod energy consumption only amounts to 2 2 percent of the national energy requirements thus some of the dod markets for p v energy systems may represent only a small fraction of the total unitedstates market for comparable applications a number of examples are also listed in thle exhibit of cases where p v energy systems for dod applications may be directly transferred to thle private sector examples include cathodic protection microwave repeater stations airway navigation warning lights and large scale applications at remote sites more generally a large p v substitution market exists in both the dod and private sector for systems currently powered by small generators novemhber 17 1981 in addition there is the real potential of moving the united states further into the international photovoltaic market there exists very little disagreement with the fact that developing third world countries need reliable energy sources the unitedstates photovoltaics industry has recognized the significance of the foreign markets to achieve futuire growth and to serve as a bridge between the applications in developing countries and gridconnected residential and commercial applications for photovoltaic systems domestically in the future countries such as the united states which are developing photovoltaic technologies have a strong commitment to promoting exports to the developing countries particularly of the global sun belt region reasons for this emphasis include the lack of a conventional energy distribution inf rastructureof ten resulting in very high energy coststhe availability of solar energy in such areas and policies of national governments to promote the use of renewvable resources as a means of reducing oil imports and the development of local industries through dod advances in photovoltalc military applications that have private sector applications these forwardlooking steps can be easily transferred abroad thus not only linking these developing nations energy advances to the united states but also allowing for the direct transfer of advanced energy technology surely our national security can only be enihianced through these efforts in international cooperation for energy resources advances legislative initiatives have attempted to stimulate d interest in the very real benefitb of alternate energy sources such as photovoltaics dod has been involved in a number of projects to promote energy conservation and alternate energy sources though the department has been doing an admirable job in promoting a steady incremental progress toward longrange national energy conservation goals wherever possible more needs to be done particularly in stressing the attributes of renewables the dod has taken just about all the steps that it can with respect to energy conservation and more emphasis must now be placed on exploiting the benefits of alternate energy sources especially as a displacement fuel for conventional fuels and overall operating costs with respect to providing a viable energy source for military construction and power systems purposes photovoltaics and other renewables offer a solution to substituting conventional fuels for other energy resources in addition during the time of war when the dod and its supporting industries energy needs would at least triple the use of photovoltaics as an alternate fuel source becomes even more valuable hence it makes good sense for the dod to become more directly involved in the development of photovoltaic energy as a replacement for conventional petroleum fuels in the field of electrical power generation the time has come for congress to create a permanent department of defense program that will establish for the dod a badly needed continuity in its longrange plans for promoting solar technologies this will assist the industry in determining exactly what it must do on its own to make this energy alternative a viable energy source for the dod by temporarily creating through government procurement a large enough market for solar cells mass production techniques will be instituted so as to drive down the cost of the cells thus stimulating a larger private demand for them up to a few weeks ago two federal programs were involved in defenserelated photovoltaics activities the federal photovoltaic utilization program fpup public law 95619 title v part 4 of the national energy conservation policy act and recent military construction authorization and appropriations bills the fpup program was established to use federal facilities as proving grounds for photovoltaic applications which would have the potential for substantial energy impacts on the public sector in the future the military construction budget on the other hand calls for the department of defense to install photovoltaic systems wherever it is cost effective unfortunately for a number of years there have been two conflicting costeffective formulas dictating what the dod does with this renewable energy source these inconsistent formulas which come from the authorizing and appropriating language to the dod military construction budget have effectively prevented the dod from effectively applying photovoltaics in a more aggressive manner unfortunately neither program has provided the proper impetus for promoting both photovoltaic commercialization and market development worse yet president reagan who has shown great sympathy for the nuclear energy industry has exhibited a strong dislike for alternate energy sources in america no funding has been placed in the fiscal year 1982 doe budget for photovoltaic commercialization or market development only for research and development as a matter of fact the presidents budget is replete with such devastating budget cuts in the area of alternate energy sources this is surely a sad state of affairs for americas energy future photovoltaic projects originally set to receive 160 2 million in fiscal year 1981 received only 144 6 million after the presidents rescission and deferral scheme for fiscal year 1981 for fiscal year 1982 this funding level stands at only 97 6 million ijn addition in the general area of solar energy with a 585 million original funding level for fiscal year 1981 this figure dropped to about 303 million after reconciliation for fiscal year 1982 thc ghi this figure of 303 million is a disappointment to those who want to see energy independence achieved within the foreseeable future it certainly is more generous than president reagans 193 3 million figure for fiscal year americas energy misfortunes are compounded by the administrations blanket decision to slowly take apart doe and provide no viable substitute for doe the federal energy agency this sad situation signals to me loud and clear that dod must step in and take over in those critical energy areas that affect its energy needs in the case of photovoltaics its technology reliability and cost effectiveness has been proven time and time again and these factors have placed photovoltaics at a level ready for commercialization now more than ever the dod must step in to replace the doe in advancing the commercialization and market development of photovoltaics and other renewable energy sources that have drect military and civilian applications we can no longer depend on the doe to carry the ball for photovoltaics and other renewables and we cannot rely on does past track record in this area to fall back on for support and guidance after all federal agencies primarily are the mouthpiece of the governing administration and past administrations have not followed the congressional intent for federal energy programs in the past the carter administration was very lax in pursuing congressionally created photovoltaic programs president carters cry for meeting 20 perc~ent of our nations energy needs through solar energy could never have been achieved had we relied on his budget recommendations as illustrative of that administrations shortcomings in this area it even failed in the fiscal year 1980 budget to have the doe or even omb request any funds for the fpup program with good reason the house science and technology subcommittee on energy development and applications was greatly concerned that the congressional mandate to begin fpup in 1980 was being ignored ultimately only about 38 million of the original 98 million was ever funded for fpup purposes and 7 million of this still remains uncommitted never really having gotten off the ground properly the fpup program expired at the end of fiscal year 1981 leaving an unimpressive story to tell this is hardly a step in the right direction for pronmoting energy selfsufficiency the question that comes to my mind at this point is who or what will fill the gap for promoting photovoltaic and other solar energy uses in hi 8422 america particularly through the tapping of our military resources the federal track record in photovoltaics has never experienced a winning moment criticism leveled against the does past treatment of photovoltaic programs that was observed on september 19 1978 before the senate subcommittee on energy research and development of the senate committee on energy and natural resources is aptly appropriate today to capsulize does experience with photovoltales to date senator gary harts opening statement for the subcommittee record stated present and past administrations have fallen into a disturbing habit of submitting unrealistically low budget requests for this program in the interest of demonstrating fiscal restraint leaving congress to authorize and appropriate the program at levels consistent with the developmental needs of this technology the unfortunate result has been the evolution of a federal photovoltiles program which lacks coherence a s nse of mission and priorities and the commnitment of the department of energy it seems reasonable to deduce that based on the does past track record it has been painfully slow in addressing the mandate of congress to start a purchasing program for photovoltaics and certainly fiscal year 1982 does not promise to be a great year for doe photovoltaics efforts which now will be advancing at a snails pace perhaps though we should be looking on the bright side for regardless of does failings in the photovoltaic area dods experiences have been more impressive but still rather limited when compared to congress original intentions for what role pholovoltales will play in americas energy futiure dod has been rather outspoken in the past with respect to the very real benefits it stands to receive by utilizing photovoltaics though realizing that there are appropriate military applications for this energy source the dod has unfortunately been dealing with photovoltaics on a limited scale for a number of years in program plan for department of defense participation in the doe dod initiative for solar photovoltaics utilization of april 1978 it summarizes the conclusion that appeared in a report released by the federal energy administration entitled dod photovoltaic market inventory and analysis this report sought to lay out the groundwork for promoting these conclusions as part of the fpup program the conclusions were dod is the largest single federal user of petroleum fuel and therefore has the maximum energy savings payoff potential dod has a greater variety of electric powered equipment and facilities and can cover more application types which would result in greater spinoff to pl ivate sector markets a coherent inhouse product design development production and deployment structure exists from r d labs to procurement offices depots and maintenance facilities extensive test and evaluation facilities exist throughout the world this is especially significant in that the test facilities themselves are a major early market for photovoltaics by conducting official dod testing on early applicvtions at the test sites the lead time for introduction of these new systems in dod can be shortened physical security at military bases can insure against vandalism which could be a serious problem for other agencies this would not necessarily hinder visibility an aggressive public affairs program can accomplish visibility and technology transfer existing facilities provide the capabilities to implement monitor and evaluate the cross impacts of various options in a controlled environment with the dods public position evidencing a strong support of and commitment to photovoltaics it appears obvious that dods efforts to utilize photovoltaics to a greater degree could only be assisted by substituting the two conflicting formulas presently applicable to dod photovoltiac activities for a formula that offers a realistic and straightforward approach to determining the cost effectiveness of photovoltaics for military construction and power systems purchases ever sinde doe and dod initially got involved in photovoltaics and other solar renewables there hals been a problem in devising a formula that realistically appraises the cost effectiveness of these valuable energy resources within a world of rising energy costs volatile political situations in oilproducing countries and the need to develop alternate energy sources gone are the days when solar renewables were considered merely novel or an energy source for the future the future has arrived today photovoltaics and other solar renewables have proven their reliability and usefulness time and time again congress and dod must join efforts in developing these promising energy alternatives america has everything to gain and nothing to lose by this effort the department of defense renewable energy utilization act offers the dod the opportunity to do its part to guide this nation to a higher level of energy independence and energy security which in turn leads to our national security forced to live beneath an energy ceiling america needs the dods expertise resources and commitment to national security to move it closer to an energy independence that is secure reliable and permanent e"]]}
