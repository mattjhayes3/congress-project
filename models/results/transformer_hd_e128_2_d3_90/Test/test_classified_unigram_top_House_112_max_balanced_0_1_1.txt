kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps volunteers are not representatives of the american government they are representatives of the american people that was always emphasized very very strongly to all of us as part of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these

were invited to a restaurant in mogadishu crowds of hundreds of people gathered and it was the sensation of the town for a couple weeks of course they couldnt be paid for doing this sort of thing but

white house issues the statement of administration policy and when they have concerns about provisions in a piece of legislation they have never been shy or reticent to share that with us as i read the statement of administration policy the president doesnt seem to have a problem with where that line has been drawn i would also point out that the companion legislation on the senate side s 1933

to improve upon this bill that would have provided for revenue sharing with coastal states and a study and report back to congress to ensure that the department of interior has proper funding for staffing and training and technical engineers and such other personnel as is necessary to responsibly increase offshore drilling as a representative from an oil and gas producing district and state i am aware that offshore drilling is an important component of the nations energy supply and provides many gulf communities with significant jobs and income my state supplies 20 percent of the nations oil production onethird of the nations natural gas production a quarter of the nations refining capacity and nearly 60 percent of the nations chemical manufacturing the texas energy and petrochemical clusters employ 600 000 people which represent 70 percent and 15 percent respectively of the total unitedstates workforce in those industries houston is home to some of the worlds largest oil gas and petrochemical facilities as the fourth most populous city in the united states and the greater houston area remains a diversified regional economy with the energy industry contributing 50 percent of our economic base for employment even so there is no denying the importance of the energy industry for creating jobs in houston and across our nation we have consistently led the nation in petroleum production since the early 10th century and we have onefourth of total unitedstates oil reserves as a coastal state we provide the resources and the mechanisms to support the offshore drilling industry and we also bare the highest risk to our natural resources its stands to reason that we should also have access to revenue generated from offshore leases federal revenues from offshore leases were estimated at 18 0 billion in fy 2008 by the department of the interior during the previous 10 years 19982007 revenues from federal ocs leases reached as high as 7 6 billion in fy 2006 higher prices for oil and gas are the most significant factors in the revenue swings of the 18 0 billion offshore revenue in fy 2008 8 3 billion was from royalties and 9 5 billion came from bonus bids coastal states can use that money to further support the industry that utilizes our highways and waterways a significant portion of oil and gas produced from gulf outer continental shelf leases is transported to those refineries for processing via offshore pipeline through state waters providing coastal states with additional access to revenue will enable these states to protect their natural resources and advance the transport of oil gas and petrochemicals across the united states coastal states like texas with energy development off their shores in federal waters have been seeking additional federal revenues generated off our shores we particularly want more assistance for coastal areas that may be most affected by onshore and nearshore activities that support offshore energy development currently the affected states receive revenue indirectly from offshore oil and gas leases in federal waters this is in contrast to the direct revenues to states that have onshore federal leases within their boundaries coastal states bear the greatest risks if there is a disaster because of the current and wind patterns in the gulf of mexico texas coastal natural resources are most at risk for environmental damage in the event of an oil spill from an offshore production platform or pipeline in addition a substantial portion of federal outer continental shelf production is refined in texas and then transported via state highways or pipeline located in the state a significant amount of the infrastructure that will be used to explore and develop the resources in these new lease sales will be constructed in texas and transported through state waters the same might be said for other coastal states whose shores and resources are dedicated to offshore drilling annual rental rates are 5 9 50 per acre with lease sizes generally ranging from 2 5005 760 acres however annual rental rates for the march 2009 sale in the central gulf of mexico begins at 11 00 per acre for lease in water depths over 200 meters initial lease terms of 510 years are standard and leases continue as long as commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are being produced demand for petroleum products in the unitedstates remains strong in 2005 each of the estimated 296 million people in the unitedstates used an average of almost three gallons of petroleum every day in 1978 the average american used 3 5 gallons per day in 2006 crude oil imports totaled 10 1 million barrels per day mbd twothirds of the total unitedstates supply of 15 2 mbd according to the energy information administration eia of the unitedstates department of energy doe after several additions of other petroleum products by refiners and fuel blenders total petroleum consumption came to 20 6 mbd for 2006 the oil and gas industry supports job growth in my state of texas and across our nation in texas the oil and gas industry supports 1 7 million jobs and approximately 25 percent of the states economy whereas nationwide the industry supports 9 2 million jobs and 7 5 percent of our nations economy we should focus our attention on providing the department of interior with funding and resources it needs to provide for training and staffing of technical engineers and other such necessary personnel to review drilling permit applications and determine future offshore lease sale areas the department of interior must be properly funded and staffed with technical engineers to review permits examine lease sales and ensure that each application is afforded proper consideration for these reasons i urge
