unto you the pope also said the golden rule compels us to protect and defend human life at every stage of developmentand of course that includes the unborn it is wrong to remain silent he said or to look the other way when individuals are put at risk at the white house welcoming ceremony earlier in the day president obama spoke of protecting the least of these taken from matthews gospel the 25th chapter when president obama says protect the least of these he excludes millions of unborn children every day planned parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons to death approximately 900 unborn babies the least of these and hurts many women in the process subsidized by half a billion dollars annually planned parenthood kills a baby every 2 minutes and has terminated the lives of over 7 million infants since 1973 a staggering loss of childrens lives that equates to twice the number of every man woman and child living in the state of connecticut so i rise in strong support of h r 3495 the womens health and public safety act authored by our distinguished colleague sean duffy to give states the authority to defund planned parenthood states indeed should have the freedom to choose who they subsidize and why but the president has denied that option to at least six states so far including texas arizona indiana louisiana alabama and arkansas the latter three states had moved to defund in the wake of the recent undercover videos by the center for medical progress now because of the cmp videos we know planned parenthood is also trafficking in baby body parts i would note parenthetically i wrote the trafficking victims protection act to try to end the cruelty of modernday slavery sex trafficking and labor trafficking planned parenthoods activities are a manifestation of human trafficking exploiting defenseless unborn children and taking body parts that they have no right to take it turns out planned parenthood has turned these babies into human guinea pigs and it makes the abortion industry even richer although much of the media continues to ignore this scandal planned parenthoods meticulously crafted facade of care and compassion has been shattered caught on tape planned parenthoods top leadership not interns or lower level employees show callous disregard for precious childrens lives while gleefully calculating the financial gain which begs the question do americans understand the violence to children done every day in planned parenthood clinics have my congressional colleagues has the president actually watched the videos to care for the least of these have they watched them in one clip dr deborah nucatola senior director of planned parenthood federation of americas medical services says we have been very good at getting heart lung liver because we know that i am not going to crush that part so they crush all around that part that is desired dismember that baby piece by piece but they leave intact certain parts including livers that will then be sold planned parenthood medical directors council president dr mary gatter appears on the video nonchalantly talking about utilizing a less crunchy her wordsabortion method again to preserve body parts regarding the price tag for baby body parts she says let me just figure out what others are getting and if this in the ballpark then it is fine if it is still low then we can bump it up she says another planned parenthood director deborah vanderhei says we are just trying to figure out as an industry and it is the abortion industry we are just trying to figure out how we are going to manage remuneration because the headlines would be a disaster concern for making money finding another revenue stream but no concern whatsoever for that child victim who suffers when they are dismembered arms legs torso decapitated head it is gruesome dismemberment abortions that is what planned parenthood does one woman holly odonnell from stemexpress says she gave me the scissors and told me that i had to cut down the middle of the face i cant even describe what that feels like she says i suspect that if the president watches at least one of the videos and my colleagues on the

south dakota yesterday marked the deadline for all americans to file their 2015 taxes and americans from all walks of life disclosed some of their most private information and handed over their hardearned dollars to the government with this in mind last week i was proud to introduce legislation prohibiting the use of funds by the irs to target citizens for exercising their first amendment rights americans have seen federal agencies abuse their power and the irs is one of the worst offenders the irs has specifically targeted conservative groups simply for being conservative this is a direct violation of the first amendment my bill preserves the integrity of the first amendment by ensuring its protections are never compromised by unelected federal bureaucrats specifically h r 4903 protects americans by prohibiting use of funds by the irs and its rogue bureaucrats to carry out government abuse on citizens for exercising their constitutional rights i can think of nothing more despicable than persecution for beliefs tax day is stressful enough with the tax code we have in place the irs has no business in striking fear into the hearts of americans for expressing their strongly held beliefs and convictions the constitution is the law of the land whether the irs likes it or not we must hold the irs and its unelected bureaucrats accountable especially because they have overstepped their constitutional bounds before as my colleague pointed out my colleague on the other side may dispute our legislation but they cant dispute the facts my colleagues serving on the oversight and government reform committee and the ways and means committee have been investigating the irs unlawful targeting of conservative groups since 2012 they were dogged in their pursuit of justice for every americans fundamental right the freedom of speech the investigation revealed that as a result of the supreme courts decision in citizens united v federal election commission democratic leadership pressured irs bureaucrats to fix the problem by taking an aggressive stance against political speech by taxexempt entities my colleagues also found clear evidence and testimony that the tea party and other conservative organizations were targeted for enhanced scrutiny because their organizations names reflected their conservative beliefs for 27 months from february 2010 until may 2012 the irs systematically targeted conservative taxexempt applicants for additional scrutiny and delay this is an egregious violation of the first amendment rights of all americans the leader of this scheme was lois lerner an irs official at the time as was mentioned in april 2010 a sensitive case report on the targeted tea party groups is shared with lerner when she first learned of a spike in tea party applications in june and july of 2011 lerner is briefed that employees are using such terms as tea party patriots 9 12 project government spending government debt taxes and make america a better place to live to flag applications lerner after learning about such terms tells the cincinnati office to revise its guidelines for flagging applications the guidance is expanded to include organizations involved with political lobbying or advocacy for exemption under 501 c 3 or 501 c 4 also lois lerners hard drive supposedly crashed that june erasing 2 years worth of emails how convenient was that in march 2012 darrell issa thenchairman of the committee on house oversight and government reform expressed concern to the irs inspector general that tea party groups were being targeted by the irs doug shulman irs commissioner at the time vehemently denied on the record to congress that the agency was targeting conservative groups in may 2013 lois lerner testified before the house committee on oversight and government reform she proclaimed her innocence before invoking her fifth amendment right and refusing to answer questions from lawmakers for 2 more years the irs circumvented congress investigations lois lerner time and time again refused to cooperate with congress in its investigation of targeting conservative groups and instead hid behind the fifth amendment before i was elected to congress my colleagues in the house of representatives rightly voted to hold lois lerner in contempt of congress for her refusal to cooperate with ongoing

been very controversialnorth carolina has gotten a bad rapand this article from abc news north carolinas controversial antilgbt bill explained the article says several civil rights groups and lgbtq advocates are organizing a rally tonight in raleigh this is from march 24 of this year north carolina to protest the states controversial passage of its house bill 2 which critics have called the most antilgbt bill in the country the article says heres everything you need to know about the bill also known as the public facilities privacy and security act which was signed into law by governor pat mccrory on wednesday what does it do house bill 2 declares that state law overrides all local ordinances concerning wages employment and public accommodations thus the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own rules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual orientation and gender identity though north carolina does have a statewide nondiscrimination law it does not include specific protections for lgbtq people we keep adding letters you know we kept adding letters until we got to lgbt and now we have added q the law also directs all public schools government agencies and public college campuses to require that multipleoccupancy bathrooms and changing facilities such as locker rooms be designated for use only by people based on their biological sex stated on their birth certificate transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get the biological sex on their birth certificate changed under the law public institutions can still offer single occupancy facilities and nobody has a problem with that if you have got a single bathroom facility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom that is fine it can be for whoever needs to use it but they are saying as has been consistent with the history of the world for most of the worlds existence that if you according to documentation are a female you use the female restroom when it is for multiple peoples use at the same time and if by documentation you are a male you use the male facilities it has really been shocking to see how many people including singers and entertainers and different groupsi understand target now wants to make sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please but it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we have to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there if a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom according to the big popular movement now for heavens sake lets let the man go in the little girls bathroom north carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the world since the world began if you are going to have a multipleuse restroom normally you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom a male go to a male multiuse restroom this article goes on it says republican lawmakers who make up the majority of north carolinas general assembly publicly unveiled the language of the bill wednesday morning it goes on and talks about its passage in less than 12 hours i am talking about after its passage the bill was approved by the house and senate or after it was brought forward the bill was passed signed by the governor lawmakers in the house voted 8325 to pass the bill the senate approved the bill 32 0 after democrats who make up the minority walked out of the chamber in protest obviously they want men to go to little girls restrooms too republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from radical action by charlotte critics of charlottes ordinance said it could have allowed men who may be sexual offenders to enter a womans restroom or locker room by claiming a transgender identity well critics of the charlotte ordinance is what the article says but actually that is not just a claim that is a fact under what north carolina was objecting to if someone who is a sexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little girls restroom where he has no business people like the entertainer that doesnt want to go to north carolina they are saying by golly you have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom what has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part of this country i mean there was a very intelligent man on fox news bill oreilly who actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show so they passed this law they dont want men going into the womens restroom basically was the crux of it or boys going in where little girls go he asked the question actually who are they trying to protect i couldnt believe that we have come to the point where an intelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question whether you agree or disagree with what north carolina did whom they were trying to protect it is almost rhetorical clearly whether you agree or disagree they were trying to protect the little girls 1245 it is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question gee whom are they trying to protect by saying men cant go into girls restrooms incredible the outrage aimed at north carolina has just been incredible i see an article today by ryan lovelace from the washington examiner trump slams north carolina bathroom law says state should leave it the way it is the way apparently charlotte was going to have it was that men could go in little girls restrooms of course sexual predators who are male all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get to go in the little girls restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them a sexual predator whom are they trying to protect in north carolina they are trying to protect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves they count on adults to keep them from harm it is incredible that people are outraged at north carolina anyone who has children who are female do you really want men to say i am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going to the bathroom where you cant go because you are not transgender you are the girls father this article says what do proponents of the bill argue it says republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from radical action by charlotte john rustin president of the north carolina family policy council testified before the senate saying that the charlotte ordinance means men could enter women restrooms and locker roomsplacing the privacy safety and dignity of women and the elderly at great risk parenthetically i noticed an article in recent days last week that indicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender restrooms has had a problemand it has come up a couple of timeswhere men would come in where women were showering go into the restroom and use their cell phone hold it up over the stall so they can film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some privacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom what is wrong with saying do you know what when it comes to going to the restroom females will go to female males will go to male and look if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to use or families to use to change diapers or whatever those are really handy those are very helpful my wife and i have used them ourselves raising girls it is a handy thing to have but why condemn north carolina when they are just trying to protect the privacy of girls it has already been shown that if you give guys a chance to say i am transgender and i can get to go in and film a girl in a shower there will be people that do that why not let the transgender lgbtqrstwhatever the initials arelet them have their activities where they dont impose upon the privacy of someone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from the opposite sex being there with them governor mccrory wrote this statement the basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings a restroom or locker room for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of charlotte as a result i have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect april i i mentioned that i understand target may now be changing their restrooms i will have to doublecheck because if they are going to be having women come to mens restrooms i wont be going to target to shop unless and until that changes usually target is great they have the restroom right there where you go in the door to the store normally you dont have to go clear to the back of the store it is a handy thing if you have to go shopping it is handy but not anymore anybody that wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex may need to shop elsewhere we will have to look at what they have actually done anyway this article seems to make the point that it is not such a crazy thing that north carolina has done and that is why for 99 999 percent of human history since civilization exists since we got past the caveman era when there have been public restrooms you recognize there is a difference between males and females some day it will be written in the rise and fall of the united states that the greatest freest and most powerful country in the history of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the pinnacle of its greatness and successand this will be one of the symptoms that was written aboutthat they thought they were so much smarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a difference was recognized between men and women for purposes of facilities it is a sad day for the country now i see this article from yesterday that curt schilling an espn analyst was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media post here is what schilling said the post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and womens clothing with parts of the tshirt cut out to expose his chest it says let him into the restroom with your daughter or else you are a narrowminded judgmental unloving racist bigot who needs to die apparently this kind of thing offends espn although at one time their job was covering sports now their job is being social managers apparently in making sure that if men want to go to little girls restrooms then we let the men go to little girls restrooms this article from yesterday talking about target stores says target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify how about that et tu target so here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name of political correctness rules the day common sense is no longer common and to the point that the current leader in the republican campaign for president even says that north carolina should not have taken action that in essence says menwhich would include sexual predatorsshould not be allowed to go in womens restrooms he wanted it left like it was so if charlotte wants to say that if you are a man and you are a sexual predator and you say you are transgender and want to go into the restroom where little girls are go ahead that is the position of the leading republican candidate i dont know hopefully that will be another one of the positions he will change but in the meantime we need to get common sense back in charge in america while we are still the great country we have been i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume h r 758 the lawsuit abuse reduction act would restore mandatory sanctions for frivolous lawsuits filed in federal court many americans may not realize it but today under what is called rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure there is no requirement that those who file frivolous lawsuits pay for the unjustified legal costs they impose on their victims even when those victims prove to a judge the lawsuit was without any basis in law or fact as a result the current rule 11 goes largely unenforced because the victims of frivolous lawsuits have little incentive to pursue additional litigation to have the case declared frivolous when there is no guarantee of compensation at the end of the day h r 758 would finally provide light at the end of the tunnel for the victims of frivolous lawsuits by requiring sanctions against the filers of frivolous lawsuits sanctions which include paying back victims for the full costs of their reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result of the rule 11 violation including attorneys fees the bill also strikes the current provisions in rule 11 that allow lawyers to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims and demands by simply withdrawing them within 21 days this change eliminates the free pass lawyers now have to file frivolous lawsuits in federal court the current lack of mandatory sanctions leads to the regular filing of lawsuits that are clearly baseless so many frivolous pleadings currently go under the radar because the lack of mandatory sanctions for frivolous filings forces victims of frivolous lawsuits to roll over and settle the case because doing that is less expensive than litigating the case to a victory in court correspondence written by someone filing a frivolous lawsuit which became public concisely illustrates how the current lack of mandatory sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits leads to legal extortion that correspondence to the victim of a frivolous lawsuit states i really dont care what the law allows you to do its a more practical issue do you want to send your attorney a check every month indefinitely as i continue to pursue this under the lawsuit abuse reduction act those who file frivolous lawsuits would no longer be able to get off scotfree and therefore they could not get away with those sorts of extortionary threats any longer the victims of lawsuit abuse are not just those who are actually sued rather we all suffer under a system in which innocent americans everywhere live under the constant fear of a potentially bankrupting frivolous lawsuit as the former chairman of the home depot company has written an unpredictable legal system casts a shadow over every plan and investment it is devastating for startups the cost of even one illtimed abusive lawsuit can bankrupt a growing company and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs the prevalence of frivolous lawsuits in america is reflected in the absurd warning labels companies must place on their products to limit their exposure to frivolous claims a 5inch brass fishing lure with three hooks is labeled harmful if swallowed a vanishing fabric marker warns it should not be used for signing checks or any legal documents as signatures will disappear completely a household iron contains the warning never

dashboard warns do not drive with sun shield in place not to be outdone a giant yellow pages directory warns do not use this directory while operating a motor vehicle here are just a couple of examples of frivolous lawsuits brought in federal court in which judges failed to award compensation to the victims a man sued a television network for 2 5 million because he said a show it aired raised his blood pressure when the network publicized his frivolous lawsuit he demanded the court make them stop although the court found the case frivolous not only did it not compensate the victim it granted the man who filed the frivolous lawsuit an exemption from even paying the ordinary court filing fees in another case lawyers filed a case against a parent claiming the parents discipline of his child violated the eighth amendment of the constitution which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment by the government not private citizens one of the lawyers even admitted to signing the complaint without reading it the court found the case frivolous but it awarded the victim only about a quarter of its legal costs because rule 11 currently doesnt require that a victims legal costs be paid in full the lawsuit abuse reduction act would change that in his 2011 state of the union address president obama said im willing to look at other ideas to rein in frivolous lawsuits mr president here it is a onepage bill that would significantly reduce the burden of frivolous litigation on innocent americans i thank the former chairman of the judiciary committee congressman lamar smith for

40year multivolume work was completed civilization is not inherited it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew if the transmission should be interrupted civilization would die and we should be savages again it is a warning we must heed for all of our advancement in selfgovernance the rule of law and the betterment of peoples lives the world stands in crisis our actions toward evil twisted brands of militant islamic jihadism in the coming months will determine how humanity navigates the coming century as will durant correctly predicts we must either prevent the death of civilized life or become savages again responding to the paris attacks french president francois hollande is correct in saying enough is enough the coalition of willing defenders of humanity is immense the world looks toward america for our leadership why why does it have to be us people ask it is for the same reason we ask a trusted colleague for counsel for the same reason a resident asks a neighbor to help him with a heavy lift for the same reason a parishioner asks his pastor for guidance in times of crisis for the same reason a citizen asks a policeman for assistance in times of trouble and for the same reason those attacked ask a soldier to defend them for the sake of civilization we must provide it american accommodation of isis savagery through lethargy must end should america remain dispassionate and disconnected she is at risk of losing her moral compass are we really an america today that no longer can be moved by any action by beheadings immolations crucifixions sexual enslavement and human suffering in the lands that these savages have forcibly taken are we so selfindulged that we somehow think that leaving isis alone is a legitimate option for the good of the world the president has suggested that isis actions are acts of genocide on that we absolutely agree 2045 yazidis have been targeted by isis in their genocidal fanaticism one city overrun saw isis lining up all males 12 and above in a gymnasium separated them into groups and systematically exterminated them young yazidi girls whose only crime was being born have been forced into sodomistic sexual slavery by a godless evil twisted brand of islamist jihadist ideology that also conveniently fits rape and child molestation into a twisted sinister form of ethics in mosul and palmyra christians have been singled out for destruction of life and property by marking their structures with an arabic n across iraq and syria chaldean and assyrian christians have been slaughtered while we in congress thump our chest about refugees as americans call on us to turn a blind eye toward these syrian refugees that the united nations has tried to place with willing churches and sponsors here at home have we forgotten that it is the statue of lady justice that is blindfolded as she holds up a balanced scale not the statue of liberty who holds the torch lady liberty is inscribed on our shores with these words keep ancient lands your storied pomp cries she with silent lips give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these the homeless tempesttossed to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door in the last 3 weeks more than 400 people have died in three separate attacks as a russian airliner has been blown from the sky lebanese worshippers were blown to bits and youthful french citizens and tourists were massacred as they ate at cafes and watched a concert as the world watched in horror it has also looked to the united states where america leads nations stand shoulder to shoulder where america is absent tyranny takes it chances and rears its ugly head but who would have thought america through constant inaction and listless response would allow barbarity to prosper since last year the president has been unable to articulate his strategy to aid our allies in iraq jordan turkey and israel as they react to the disintegration of syria on their borders more broadly the president has been unable and possibly unwilling to form the necessary multinational coalitions in the middle east and elsewhere that are essential to curb barbarism and provide stability within the sunni arab populations of iraq and syria where isis has filled the void as a combat veteran of iraq and other places this has been difficult for me personally to process in service past we sacrificed to turn the country around i watched my american and iraqi friends die handled the flesh and blood of infantry combat performed brutal personal combat to take human life and watched with agony as the good people of iraq suffer in absence of effective government it is personal because i have lived among the sunni arab i have celebrated their victories their weddings their birthdays and their accomplishments i have broken bread with them and eaten at their communal bowls i have mourned as close sunni arab friends have died to acts of terror mourned when sunni arab educated intelligent and free people have been expunged by isis they do not want this they have no place to go when i lived among them we told them with conviction and honesty that we would be there for them they believed us then the president ordered us out we soldiers and servicemembers who have sacrificed so much in iraq weep we defeated saddams army toppled the baathist government captured and brought a world tyrant to justice fought an insurgency and stood shoulder to shoulder with disenfranchised sunni arabs and sunni kurds to restore control to iraqs government we turned the country around together with a military pause instead of the united states nurturing a nascent iraqi infrastructure as we have done in the philippines germany japan and south korea to give them a future the president used that pause for abandonment both militarily and diplomatically worse he then used that for political expediency where we sacrificed he quit when america became absent radical evil islamic jihadists filled that gap with cruelty fear and barbarity before a nascent government and population had the strength to build trust and hold firm whatever the presidents political advantage whatever the supposed cost saving whatever the heartfelt conviction of why some believed abandonment was the optimum course of action it has instead created a political nightmare transcending nations and has bled more treasures and lives than any estimates our continued presence might have caused moreover it has sickened the hearts of world humanity to see civilization taking such punishment from savages when a quiver of options have been available to shoot at the heart of the problem america has the capacity the intelligence and the goodwill to rally nations but it cannot be a unitary effort it must be collective it cannot be a defensive effort it must be offensive to blunt further attack as president hollande of france was saying enough is enough president obama proceeded to tell america and the world what the attacks on paris were not and what our actions would not be this congress and the american people need rather to hear from our president what the attack was and what our actions will be to make them stop the president distracted by his ideological efforts though sincere on climate has failed to see that the world is on fire the people of our great republic have not failed to see it they are calling on us to stand with france and say enough is enough what should be our immediate action how about some of this cripple raqqa it is clear it is the symbolic center of isis power the presidents cabinet says we are worried about collateral damage and civilian casualties news flash the most humane thing we can do to end suffering of hundreds of thousands of people is to cripple what isis draws its strength from destroy their infrastructure hammer their electricity capacity drop their transmission lines eliminate their cell towers where they draw their communications capacity destroy the bridges on their roads of ingress and egress hammer their oil refining installations they possess and fund themselves with we have the ability to rebuild them later but isis would be diminished financially by their loss put a different way the most humane thing we can do to protect civilians is to disrupt isis immediate ability to advance and recruit if the unitedstates leads others will stand shoulder to shoulder we need our president to be that man to do these immediate actions on raqqa we also need to take the handcuffs off of our military that has already deployed weeks to get approval and missed targets allowing freedom of movement for isis is not a way to win anything it is not enough for the secretary of defense to merely endorse plans put before him by our military experts endorse that type of equivocation tells our military leaders we dont have your back we need the secretary of defense to lead dont endorse approve them the secretary must take the handcuffs off our pilots and special operations forces that are already deployed our warriors know what to hit they cant throw punches with handcuffs another action we can take world opinion and goodwill is on our side france has the support of all civilized countries they will likely have the support of a u n sanctioned effort they may ask for article v protections under nato and would likely get it so what will america do lead lets build that coalition nato special operations forces combined with kurds and sunni arabs can provide the immediate ground capacity safe zones where assad cannot reach them with airstrikes and barrel bombs will give them determinations and hope modern civilized allies can provide airpower logistics the wealth and the commitment russia has opened the door with statements from foreign minister lavarov that a stabilized syrian government cannot include assad we should walk through that door that solves having to build new governance syria has survived civil wars before she can again old structures can have new leaders with new coalitions that provide voice to all syrians once isis is expunged in iraq we must find a place for the sunni arab and sunni kurd to have selfdetermination without having to turn to isis the fighters exist but they wont fight to be enslaved by draconian shia arab governance in baghdad that gives them no future with raqqa squeezed in syria we must build the coalition to restore mosul and baiji then the disenfranchised sunni arab and sunni kurd must have a place at the table both in syria and iraq in postconflict rebuilding this will not be possible while savages run free and civilized nations do nothing america needs to build the coalition on an isisfirst policy then we can settle into the less barbaric and less threatening future we have a window do we have a president that will lead here are some immediate shortterm measures launch cyberattacks on isis recruiting web sites while interceptive communications is important and we want to track their movements and intentions we cannot confuse that with allowing isis propaganda to reach into our free communities to turn misguided youth into neighborhood attackers intercept what we must but attack what draws recruitment and copycat actions in the first place we cannot be just defensive in this area part of reducing homegrown terrorists is to cut off the juice from isis abroad they should not have a free hand in our free speech now lets talk about countermessaging here is what every american can do to help american news stations and newsprint can join the fight by not putting isisproduced videos and imagery on networks as broll on our newscasts and in articles in our newspapers why should we promote their propaganda replace it rather with crosshairs and explosions of their defeat or show rather the world their acts of barbarity and the human suffering they have created for their own people use that for broll america must stop aiding and abetting these evil savages that use our free press our laws and our protections to destroy ours americans write your local stations and ask them to please stop i want to shift my focus now to the refugee crisis while i have tried to focus my comments on actions that we should take to eliminate isis one action we should not take is to become like them america is a lamp that lights the horizon of civilized and free mankind the statue of liberty cannot have a stiff arm her arm must continue to keep the torch burning brightly if we use our passions anger and fear to snuff out her flame by xenophobic and kneejerk policy the enemy wins we have played into their hands period here are some syrian refugee facts you may not know despite a longestablished multilayered system to vet and bring refugees into the united statesi have worked with the international organization for migration on deployed battlefields and i have worked with the unhcr in their efforts to help place refugeesdespite a longestablished system despite biometric and biographic screening despite intelligence vetting with the national counterterrorism center the fbis terrorist screening center and the departments of state defense and homeland security added to the fact that syrian refugees receive additional screening to national security concernsand most of them are women and childrencoupled with the fact that only a total of 1 900 syrians have entered this country in the last 4 years most of them women and children americans across the country now are calling on lady liberty to drop her torch and give the stiff arm with perhaps even another gesture i want you to listen carefully to these statements by members of congress in response to a refugee billnot an illegal immigration bill or permanent residents but refugees a refugee bill listen to these comments by members of congress about people fleeing for their lives fighting immigration is the best votegetting argument the politician can beat his breast and proclaim his loyalty to america he can tell the unemployed man that he is out of work because some alien has a job here is another one congress must protect the youth of america from this foreign invasion and how about this one american children have first claim to americas charity there are many more but these quotes were from 1939 the refugee bill was not for muslim and christian syrians or iraqi muslims christians and yazidis it was for german jews while it was true that germany was indeed a threat the refugees were not they were 20 000 children not only did that bill of 1939 not pass but that congress with the same speech and rhetoric that i have been hearing in recent days in this august chamber passed hurdle after hurdle in 1939 to make it more difficult for refugees to enter they were unfortunately successful america protects her liberty and defends her shores not by punishing those who would be free she does it by guarding liberty with her life americans need to sacrifice and wake up we must not become them they win if we give up who we are and even more so without a fight we guard our way of life by vigilance we must be watchful we have to have each others back and be alert to dangers around us we must speak up when we see something unusual by maintaining who we are amidst the threat amidst the hatred amidst the trials we win patrick henry did not say give me safety or give me death but rather give me liberty implying that he was willing to lose his life to defend that liberty we have defended our way of life for 240 years now we as americans must defend it again we must defend it when the critic sitting on the couch in his underwear eating his bag of cheese puffs is pecking out hatred and vitriol on some social media we must defend it and have courage when voters are caught up with sincere passion demanding security that also might kill our liberty we must defend it with our warriors who have worked hard to keep the fight off our shores by being vigilant and aware at home and while looking after their families who dont have them to protect them we will always have threats but liberty when lost takes generations if ever to regain i am asking all americans tonight to pray for our president how much time really have we spent on our knees at home for our leaders how much counsel have we sought from the almighty it is god who has given us the spark shoulder to shoulder with france this of freedom it is he we must turn to congress our people our way of life he will take us and guide us in times of i yield back the balance crisis if we only ask him and humble of my time ourselves and seek his face as a nation we would not even have that nation without the aid of france lady liberty would not even stand on our shores without the generosity of france and now as civilization faces peril and trial we must stand
