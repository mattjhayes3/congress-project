quence which we have heard about long before he came to join us here in the congress as one member who is associated with the congimssional black caucus alternative i want to say i was very struck in observing the debate yesterday how much the caucus substitute affected members on the other side of aisle my colleague from new york and a leader of the administrations budget forces mr kemf in particular said a number of favorable things about the caucus budget yesterday andi i want to congratulate him on his remarks i recall that my colleague from new york did take issue with the overall tax revenue proposale in the caucur budget while at the same time congratulating the caucus in proposing the indexing of the tax code to inflatiotn and the 10percent nonrefundable social security tax credit it is good to know that at least one person on the other side of the aisle thinks the opposition is capable of having positive ideas on how to solve the economys problems yet my col3eague did say the following in opposition to our budget proposal i just wish my friends in the caucus had not seen fit to raise taxes so heavily on everyone else in the country and introduce so many zerosum tradeoffs by pitting one class of taxpayer against another what we need is more equity for all americans and less pitting classes of people against each other if this is the case then my colleague from new york should join in support of the congressional black caucus substitute after all as the dsg fact sheet on the budget says the caucus substitute offers the largest anld fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house i wish to ask my colleague from new york who is responsible for pitting classes of people against each other the cbc or the reagan administration who is calling for more tax equity and reform of a tax code that everyone knows presently is grossly inequitablethe cbc or the reagan administration who is demanding basic cuts or eliminations of domestic human resource programs the result of which will be even greater poverty than exists today and even greater unemploymentthe cbc or the reagan administration i would like my colleague from new york to answer these questions i would add a personal observation is there any one in this body who really thinks the reagan administration lattagramm budget is contributing to national unity and social consensus i would like to hear it frankly the greatest tragedy of the administrations budget plan is that it may become the single biggest factor of divisiveness and social unrest in the nation that has occurred

public interest tax to become i predict a major area of research group this proposal gives domestic conflict and economic weakbusinesses the kind of economic incen ness in the coming years i am not alone in warning of this economists as diverse as henry kaufmanwho is often called the sage of wall street and a republican i might adddr wassily leontieff the nobel prizewinning economist and authority on economic structures at new york university and dr lester thurow of mit in the last few months have all voiced the strongest doubts about the economic viability and desirability of the reagan administrations defense program i notice yesterday as reported in the washington post today the mormon church and its leaders ii a very rare comment on national policies came out in opposition to the mx missile system their statement of opposition it should be noticed by my colleagues went far beyond the mx missile the mormon church leadership squarely attacked the basic assumptions behind the unitedstates military establishment the soviet military establishment and the frightening global arms race that both superpowers equally are contributing toward referring to the terrifying arms race that~ has to be halted spencer w kimball president of the mormon church stated we deplore in particular the building of vast arsenals of nuclear weaponry history indicates that men have seldon created armaments that eventually were not put to use 0 with the most serious concern over the pressing moral question of possible nuclear conflict we plead with our national leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find viable alternatives the mormon church leadership is referring to the deadly world arms race that is draining nations of their resources and revenues that otherwise would be spent on economic and social develolimentspecifically which last year exceeded 500 billion dollars and which the reagan administration in its budget proposal is contributing mightily toward i believe there is a growing sense in this body that the defense budget will undo~whatever good might resultfrom administration economic policies and i say this as one who is highly skeptical about the administrations policies if the congresssional black caulcus and a handful of socalled house liberals alone had challenged the reagan defense budget it likely would have been dismissed summarily but the caucus is not alone in its criticism of the transfer of some 50 billion in additional budget authority to dod next year we are joined by leading churches in the land by highly respectable economists and financial leaders the simple truth is that the defense budget that the administration is proposing will intensify inflation because inflationary costs in the defense sector have been running at twice the rate as in the economy overall intensify inflation because of the widely acknowledged shortages of pro may 6 1981 duction in the defense sector and in the shortages of its labor force intensify inflation because of the widely reported monopolistic practice among defense contractors the lack of competitive contract bidding at dod and the widespread lack of pentagon control over its own budget intensify inflation because in the aggregate boosts in defense spending add income but not consumer goods and services and therefore add to the class inflation of too many dollars chasing too few goods and shift badly needed investment capital away from the civilian sectors of the economy that are mnost in need of revitalization i detect among my colleagues especially on the opposite side of the aisle a growing uneasiness about the administrations and the latta0ramms defense budget that uneasiness is understandable no one has come up with a convincing argument why an additional 50 billion in defense is needed other than the ageold shibboleths about national security and the russians are coming this morning i went over some comparative figures on the relative strengths of the unitedstates defense establishment and the soviets in termsa of defense spending during the last 10 years the nato allies have outspent the warsaw pact by 207 billion according to londons international institute for strategic studies in terms of strategic nuclear warheads the best measure of relative numerical strengths the united states has 9 200 warheads as compared to 7 000 on the soviet side of equal importance the united states has far greater command control flexibility and survivability in relation to its ability to fight a nuclear war than has the soviet union for example only 25 percent of our strategic warheads are land basedand relatively vulnerableas compared to 80 percent of the soviets warheads and because of our triad of strategic forceslandbased seabased and airbasedthe united states has a wide advantage over the soviets for example 48 percent of our strategic warheads are either at sea alert or in bombers on alert as compared to 3 percent of the soviets warheads there is a shocking orthodoxy in this chamber about the need for a stronger defense establishment despite the facts and figures despite the questionability of ever winning a nuclear war however limited or of needing any more nuclear arms than we presently have as the mormon church leaders observed my col leagues especially on the other side of the aisle still cling to the panacea of more defense spending as if it were a reflex action that arises when no other solutions to our economys problems and the worlds problems are in sight i think we ought to debate many more hours the role of defense spending in the administrations budget and in relation to economic recovery we ought to debate many more hours the assumptions behind the reagan lattagramm budget and the alternative that the congressional black caucus is proposing i would now like to touch briefly upon a matter which in terms of dollars may be considered relatively insignificant in relation to the overall federal budget however it is a very important matter because of its direct bearing upon the quality of justice in this country i speak of the legal services corporation when the congress enacted the legislation establishing the legal services corporation in 1974 it made findings about the need for such a program the congress specifically found that first there is a need in this country for equal access to our system of justice second there is a need to provide highquality legal assistance to those who are unable to afford it third providing legal assistance to those facing an economic barrier to obtaining legal help serves the ends of justice fourth the availability of legal assistance has reaffirmed for many people their faith in our government of laws pifth a legal services program should be kept free of the influence of political pressures and sixth attorneys who provide legal assistance under such a program must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients just as other members of the bar have full freedom to protect their clients interests those findings are as valid and accurate today as they were in 1974 and the need for a legal services corporation today is as great as it was in 1974 continued funding of the corporation is essential if we are to keep this countrys commitment to equal justice under the law the need for the continuation of the legal services corporation has been widely recognized in addition to numerous individual private attorneys district attorneys judges state attorneys general and state governors many national organizations have called for continued funding of the corporation including the american bar association the american association of retired persons national association of retired teachers the aflcio the american coalition of citizens with disabilities the childrens defense fund the friends committee on national legislation the league of united latin american citizens lulac the lead ership conference on civil rights the national bar association the national council of churches the national council of senior citizens the national committee against discrimination in housing the national mental health association the national farmers union the national council on aging the national urban league the national legal aid and defender association the united states conference of mayors the united states catholic conference and rural america one of the announced goals of this administration is a reduction in what it refers to as unnecessary and inefficient federal regulations continuation of the legal services corporation will not frustrate that goal the legal services corporation does not engage in any substantive regulation and it is not a part of the federal bureaucracy in addition the corporations programs are locally controlled the corporation has been soundly managed and its programs have been costeffectiveit expends only 1 8 percent of its funds on management and administration and another 1 8 percent for field monitoring and evaluation continuation of the legal services corporation has bipartisan support just last monday the judiciary committees subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice unanimously reported an authorization bill for the corporation that bill authorizes 200 million for the corporation for each of the next 2 fiscal years in addition the bill addresses some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the corporation such as in the area of class action suits and lobb ying i urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to continue the important work of the legal services corporation"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "today we consider house joint resolution 537authorizing the

york and buffalo have been an integral part of the commerce and industry of our state each year they are responsible for tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity what began as the small trading post of new amsterdam has grown into one of the worlds most modern and active ports while new yorkers and all americans can be proud of our nations ports we recognize that too often we have neglected themjust as we have neglected other natural resources in recent years the neglect of our ports has been highlighted by the delays associated with steam coal exports inadequate facilities not only limit our ability to export coal and other commodities but also increase the cost of exported goodsthereby decreasing the competitiveness of unitedstates products indeed the ports of our nation provide the vital link in our international trade program and as such they demand constant attention if we are to maintain our preeminent position in world trade national port

he lived lyndon b johnson would be 74 years of age this month august 27 i rise to honor his memory to recall his vision for america and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure and may someday this country be blessed with another leader as bold as caring as great and as determined as he was

got one bulhet through here a scar still shows on the bixck of osullivans neck and out my jaw aother one hit my tie and two more passed through my coat osullian still cannot hide his emotion as he remembers meeting his parents the next day who had known to find him at the house of sone cousins his mother knelt the entire night through from 1 30 until 7 when she got up from her knees and said joes been shot but hes not dead while recovering at the infirmary osullivan got a tip that the free staters were coming for him again so with seven pounds given him by his father and without a pass to explain his departure he left for england and worked a year as a carpenter with his brother neither of them paying income tax in protest of the british government before getting a passport to come to this country where an osullivan brother was already living in san francisco soon after arriving here the osullivan brothers joined the carpenla local 22 and found that their proffketncy in the trade

by negotiating with the homebuilders association who had until then refused any cooperation with the local osullivan enlisted serving as navy chief in the seabees for three years when the war ended he was asked to resume office with the local in 1947 he was elected president of the carpenters district councl and later president of the san francisco building and trades construction council an

were disabled as a result of their military service and for the widows and orphans of veterans who died of serviceconnected causes the bill is designed to assist these individuals and to make sure

would cost 893 5 million in fiscal year 1982 and would not exceed the targets currently contained in the first concurrent budget resolution the bill is not inflationary in that it simply provides a costofliving increase based on the anticipated rise in the consumer price index between october 1 1980 and september 30 1981 the legislation is necessary since the serviceconnected program for veterans and widows is not indexed by law serviceconnected compensation is payable to veterans who suffer from a disease or disability incurred during service the percentage of disability for a specific disability is assigned by the veterans administration that agency has established a schedule for rating disabilities which is the guideline for measuring the degree of disability compensation is paid for disabilities at ratings of 10 percent 20 percent and so forth up to 100 percent the rate of compensation payable for each percentage of disability is established by law additional compensation is payable for the loss of a limb blindness and other severe disabilities an additional dependency allowance is payable to veterans with a rating of 30 peroent or more for a spouse minor children or dependent parents historically the congress has increased compensation rates whenever there has been an appreciable increase in the costofliving index since the rates are not indexed to

opened the eyes of an older world to an entirely new one above all he personifies a view of the world that many see as quintessentially american notmerely optimistic but scornful of the very notion of despair nearly five centuries have parsed since the fateful day on which columbus changed the course of history but his adventurous spirit lives on among us challenging us to emulation andabiding with us as we too press forward on our voyage of discovery in tribute to the achievement of columbus and to the many sons and daughters of italy who have helped to shape our life and destiny as a people the congress of the united states of america has requested the president to proclaim the second monday in october of each year as columbus day now therefore 1 ronald reagan president of the united states of america do hereby designate monday october 12 1981 as columbus day and i invite the people of this nation to observe that day in schools churches and other suitable places with appropriate

and lest we forget there are other alternatives that have been proposed and yet we have heard very little mention of the congressional black caucus constructive alternative mr fauntroy the chairman of the congressional black caucus has already pointed out to you that we offer the only budget that is in surphits encourages increased jobs and productivity and relieves the american people of a growing tax burden above all the budget the cbc proposes shares theburden of austerity among the rich as well as the poor and it does so without necessarily cutting back vital social programs i note as an additional recomnmendation the analysis of the democratic study group which says that this budget takes the boldest step of any proposals being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit as to the cbc tax proposalwhich many have said provides no tax relief at allthe dsg report says that it offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any proposal before the house this is indreed a strong recommendation since this is accomplished while at the same time providing for increased defense spending and for those vital programs from energy conservation to community development to income security programs which the administration proposals would sacrifice but without which the communities we represent would not survive i want to draw your attention in particular to the functions of the cbc budget that deal with energy one of the most critical considerations of the nation as a whole and one that most seriously affects the poor of this nation it seems to me that this is one aspect of the social safety network which the administration purports to preserve and guarantee but which has been grievously overlooked the reagan administrations energy budget proposals are a complete reorientation of the federal gloverniments role in energy programs as described by the house budget committees summary and analysis the reagan budget would suggest a near total dependence on market forces for making societal transitions from an inexpensiveenergy past to a very expensiveenergy future this approach leaves unanswered two important questions to what extent must market forces be supplemented to bring about the development of new energy supplies and conservation techniques and to what extent should the federal government assist citizenisparticularly those with low incomeswith conservation and weatherization to adapt to higher energy costs th6 contradictions become clear the administration exalts virtues of unconstrained market forces and yet it was under the free play of market forces in the past that the nation became vulnerable to the oil threat of opec nationswith its derivative adverse effects it was the free play of market forces that made it possible for only those large and rich firms with easy access to capital to develop alternative energy technologies and suppliesclosing off the field to innovative and competitive small businesses and in fact the budgets endorsed by the administration clearly favor big business at the expense of smalleven though there are not necessarily economies of scale and it is small business that will generate the most employment above all under the free play of market forces families with low incomes had no recoursethrough conservation and weatherization assistance to adapt to higher energy costs which were thrust upon them these are flagrant contradictions to what the administration budget purports to do to its allegation that it is preserving the safety net that it is minding the best interests of the nation most flagrant of these contra dictions while the poor are sacrificed to untrammeled market forces special interest groups would preserve their agriculturalsubsidies addressing these concerns the congressional black caucus budget proposal focuses on alternate energy development and conservation it specifically restores funds to the energy areas which would encourage the development and research for alternate fuel sources thereby lessening our dependence on opec oil the crc budget goes forward with a program of energy conservation which is both practical and humane and allows for protection against the elements for those who can least afford to fend off the ravages of winter where the reagan budget would remove the lowincome weatherization program from the department of energy and drop it into a community development block grant somewhere in hud which is funded at a 466 million reduced budget authority the cbc restores full funding for this program and where the reagan budget would eliminate more than half of the funding of the economic regulatory administration the congressional black caucus budget restores funding to this agency to allow it to collect the 3 billion in petroleum overcharges which would go uncollected under the reagan budget by item the cbc budget restores 0 7 billion in budget authority and 0 4 billion in outlays in fiscal year 1982 for energy conservation cbc restores 0 1 billion in budget authority and 0 1 billion in outlays in cuts to the solar bank which would allow for loan supplements for solar residential use primarily cbc would restore 0 7 billion in budget authority and 0 8 billion in outlays to the nonfossil energy supply such as geothermal energy impact assistance environmental and hydro power programs it must be remembered that the cbc energy budget is reduced even greater than the reagan proposed budget some of the major reductions which cbc made to the reagan proposal were of 0 3 billion in budget authority by delaying the gaseous centrifuge uranium enrichment plant crcs budget calls for doe charging fair value prices for uranium enrichment thereby saving 0 2 billion in budget authority and 0 2 billion in outlays the cbc budget further identified 1 5 billion saved in budget authority and 1 5 billion in outlays by reducing the strategic petroleum reserve funding and allowing for private funding in an instance when it is far more valid finally cancellation of the clinch river breeder reactor is a budgetary salvation of 0 3 billion in outlays the congressional black caucus total energy budget equals 5 4 billion in budget authority and 6 0 billion in outlays the congressional black caucus energy budget comes in 3 5 billion less than reagans in budget authority and 3 5 billion less than reagans in budget outlays we have identified for you programs which would serve to rescue america from the brink of the ugly future with which this administration and its followers would harness us this adminis11h1839 tration has targeted for elimination or severe reductions those programs and thus those people who have no grand lobbyists to waive their flag who have no gargantuan sums of money to keep their concerns in front of you though these concerns may often be a real matter of life and death such as in the weatherization and low income fuel assistance programs which cbc would fund fully the cbc would speak for those people who have no voice like the small businessman who had relied on this governments promise to fund his small alcohol fuels plant but now faces losing his home and all he owns because this government has not come through with the promised funds to match those which he had mortgaged his home to get for initiali expenses the people created the government to serve the people the people created the government to look out for those too weak too young too old to look out for themselves the people created the government to protect all facets of the society not just the rich and the strong but also the mediocre and the disabled the people created the government not just for the large corporations but also for the small mom and pop businesses and the solo enterpriseo the government must now live up to the covenant of trust with which the people have entrusted it the congressional black caucus comes now not as a moses bt like moses to lead this government from this

popular measure 3 billion that was aimed at helping the most depressed industry in america that was a courageous vote and i would like to address my remarks very simply to the people who voted then to sustain the presidents veto i would like members to look at what they are doing if they voted to sustain the presidents veto when it had 3 billion to help the most depressed industry in america and if

borrowing 50 cents out of every dollar that is being borrowed in the american capital market today what members would be saying by overriding the veto here is that while they were willing to sustain a

last amendment i would like to say that we heard discussion as to whether or not we should have a block grant proposal or whether we should have a reauthorization bill personally i feel that we need to have a reauthorization bill not a block grant proposal i also feel that on the proposal as the gentleman from michigan has stated so well on the floor for the first time now we hear that if we have a block grant proposal we would have 100 million and i do not feel that that li adequate however i do feel that the amount that is presently provided in the legislation is not needed i feel that with the reductions that have been made through amendments on the scope of the activities of the recipients of the legal services corporation such as lobbying efforts with fulltime lobbyists such as class action suits and such as representation of illegal aliens and others it is no longer necessary to have that full amount of 260 million i have offered this amendment which provides for 241 million and which is a 25percent reduction in the amount that was appropriated for the current fiscal year i know that to some people that sounds very harsh that means that a lot of people that they feel should be represented will not be represented however i disagree and i do not believe that that will be necessary i believe with the full amount of 241 million in the scope of services that the legal services corporation has now to offer to the poor that they can do an adequate job for that amount of money otherwise i would not offer the amendment i also feel that at this time with the budget restrictions that we have and the reductions that must be made in light of other reductions that are going to be made it is appropriate that this amount be the amount authorized this amendment also restricts the authorization to a 1year authorizatton i provide that because i too believe that we have to get a handle on the legal services corporation there is no question about the fact that there have been abuses in the past some of us feel very strongly that those abuses should be corrected amendments have been adopted that i believe will assure that those abuses are corrected and that the legal services corporation does provide proper representation for the poor however i question whether we should pernit an authorization for 2 years my feeling personally is that we should be willing to come back next year and then let us take a look and let us see what they have actually done and let us see whether or not we should continue to fund it at this level or whether we need additional levels this is what we call oversight i think we need to have strong oversight of the legal services corporation i think we also on the other hand need to see this in the event that this matter does become law because i think there is that possibility i believe that the president if the house and the senate do pass it with the corrections that are made in it should at least be given the opportunity to sign it and i am sure that there are members from his own party who will try to impress upon him the need to sign this legislation in the event that has been done the administration then will be the one that will be administering it and i think we need to look at it again in that light as to how it will be administered therefore i feel strongly that we should have a 1year authorization and that the amount of 241 million is appropriate i feel that that is an adequate amount as i said before i do disagree very very strongly with those who will tell us when we get back in the full house that we need the block grant proposal the gentleman from illinois as i understand it will offer the block grant proposal and i feel very strongly that that is the wrong way to go in the first place they say that if we pass the authorization bill then the president will veto it and we are not going to have anything well if we pass what the gentleman from illinois proposes that we pass we are not going to have anything either for the simple reason that there is no question and i think every member in here at least the majority will agreethat there will be no social services block grant legislation enacted into law by october 1 1981 and i am sure that probably will not be enacted into law maybe by next spring by a year from now so if we defeat this legislation and then put in a

concerns there is no question that there are several areas in which the mdbs can improve their methods of operationfor example increasing the accent on private sector development and enforcing a greater level of conditionality in their lending which encourages worthwhile economic reforms in the borrower countries the administration has been pushing the multilateral agencies to put greater emphasis on market economic principles i believe this is a reasonable objective and we have a reasonable chance of success in that effort but we have to pay to play we cannot cut our contribution drastically and still expect other countries to follow our advice in these international banks i would challenge the statement that our contributions to ida do not foster economic responsibility in the recipient countries quite the contrary the banks are major sources for sound economic advice they have used their financial leverage effectively to encourage the adoption of microand macropolicy changes beneficial to the economies of the borrower countries the mdbs however can be more forceful in this regard than they have been with renewed unitedstates leadership in the multilateral agencies
