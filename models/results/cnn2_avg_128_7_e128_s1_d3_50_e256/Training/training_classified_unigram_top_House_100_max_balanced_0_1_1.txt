contains 10 206 billion in new discretionary budget authority and 9 128 billion in new discretionary outlays these figures are under the budget authority and outlay targets that were set pursuant to the economic summit agreement unfortunately in the process of making the economic summit budget reductions we have had to reduce transportation programs by approximately 3 percent more than i believe was required to meet our targets the coijferees had agreed to add language mandating the sale of railroad redeemable preference share equity instruments held by the federal governmentwhich will yield an outlay savings of 240 million unfortunately while the omb and cbo ruled this to be a legitimate savings they would not credit these savings to the transportation bill this scorekeeping gamesmanship will have important real life consequences for our important transportation programs i find it unfortunate that the economic summit agreement participants chose to leave the final decislonmaking authority to such an improtant task to the unelected officials at omb an cbo i hope we do not make that same mistake in the future i am submitting for the record at this point a table summarizing the

the gentleman from new york who preceded me discussing the tragic situation in haiti he has shown a great deal of interest in and concern for the people of haiti and i think he speaks quite sensibly about what we ought to be doing but i want to talk tonight about the presidential campaign some of the members across the aisle have decided that this is an appropriate forum in which to do campaigning i will have to concede that i have not done the research that some of my colleagues on the side have done and i do not have a lot of quotations to offer it always seems to me that if people want to read those things they can read them on their own i want to talk about some aspects of the campaign that are distressing to me and i know that my friend the gentleman from new york and some others want to join in one of the things that struck me is the extent to which vice president bush feels compelled on important issues to be obedient to the rightwing in this country it is interesting that george bush when he ran for president in 1080 and was defeated by ronald reagan was seen as a more moderate candidate than than ronald reagan and interestingly as we look at the reagan candidacy and look at the bush candidacy we see in the case of george bush in my view much more of a willingness to toe the line than the rightwing sets ronald reagan himself felt rooted in that conservative movement and as one who was confident of his own place in that conservative movement he felt much freer to disagree with people in the conservative movement when he thought common sense required him to do so for instance we had the case of the inf treaty when the great majority of the conservative movement as they call themselves in this country reacted quite angrily to the inp treaty ronald reagan had the selfconfidence to say that they were acting in an even more bizarre fashion than some of them usually do and he went ahead with it george bush unlike ronald reagan is unsure of himself with that rightwing which has become such an important element in the republican party and therefore when the rightwing growls on its key issues george bush unlike ronald reagan is paralyzed and will not disagree we have had example after example this year of george bush being held to a standard by the rightwing which is in my judgment damaging to the country we begin with the choice of his vice president no one outside of his immediate family thinks that dan quayle is qualified to be the vice president of the united states i do not know how his immediate would vote on a secret ballot george bush picked him because he was given a very short list by the far right when ronald reagan had to pick a vice presij nt he did not feel he owed the far right a veto over his choice because he picked a man george bush who did not at that time look that attractive to him george bush of course has spent the intervening 8 years trying very hard to kowtow to the far right so they would no longer be vetoing him people might remember the famous trek george bush made a couple of years ago to speak at a dinner in honor of the late william loeb publisher of the manchester unionleader an extraordinarily virulent unfair rightwing newspaper publisher who had denounced george bush but bush was so eager to win back the rightwing and to release that rightwing opposition to him that he humbled himself before the unionleaders people well george bush had to pick a vice president and unlike ronald reagan george bush felt he could not do anything the rightwing would have objected to so he picked for vice president probably the least qualified nominee for national office on a major party ticket in a very very long time i confess i am not fully cognizant of all the more obscure vicepresidential nominees earlier in this century but of those i can think of in the last 50 years the current vicepresdential nominee dan quayle is clearly the least qualified but that is not even controversial why was he picked because the rightwing gave george bush a short list it had on it a couple of people like our colleague the gentleman from new york george bush did not want to pick him he thought he might be overshadowed so he picked someone the rightwing would accept someone who would not overshadow him so that is how he picked quayle george bush suggested about a month ago that we should not go full speed ahead with the installation of the star wars antimissile device because it is going to cost hundreds and hundred of millions of dollars in violation of the antiballistic missile treaty that was richard nixons accomplishment and it could be destabalizing to our efforts to get a substantial nuclear arms reduction agreement with the russians george bush suggested that and then the rightwing growled then george bush unsuggested it on issue after issue after issue of central importance picking a vice president american defense george bush makes moves that are calculated to please the rightwing and i think that is terribly dangerous it is why we have george bush among other things talking about the relationship between the united states and the soviet union in terms far to the right of ronald reagan ronald reagan has achieved with general secretary gorbachev some real gains one of our great hopes is that we will be able to build on that not out of any love for or trust of the soviet union but out of a recognition that we have mutual interests that we are trying to deal with both the strategic and economic impact of an allout arms race george bush has been forced by his fear of the rightwing to back off on that we had another example in fact this has been a good week for george bush i should give credit where credit is due he has not had to fire one antisemi ie from his campaign this whole week i think that is about the first time in a long time that he has not had to do that no one thinks george bush is himself antisemitic no one thinks that george bush was happy with some of the virulent antisemites who were on his ethnic outreach council why were they there because the rightwing gave him a list and because george bush does not have the political courage or toughness to challenge the rightwing he is a man who is politically paralyzed by fear of the rightwing on a few issues where they do not care they give him a little freedom he can go off on the minimum wage and that is ok he can take a little bit of freedom in another area but on the picking of the vicepresidential candidate the most important decision one can make when hie is about to become a presidential candidate on the question of star wars on relationships with the soviet union on his ethnic outreach council when the rightwing insists george bush is there that i believe is terribly dangerous when you have on the right people like pat robertson and others who have i think moved beyond the plausible in their advocacy when you have this blind unwillingness to recognize that there is a chance to reach based on mutual agreement and mutual interests an arms reduction pact with the russians i think that becomes very frightening so one of the central parts of the campaign that has emerged so far is the extent to which george bush unlike ronald reagan will not deviate in any significant area from the agenda of the far right and unfortunately that is a party that has taken up faction that has taken over more and more of the republican party we have the most extremely rightwing platform coming out of the republican party this year again to the right of where the reagan platforms were in 1980 and 1984 because ronald reagan as a genuine conservative with a sense of his own place was prepared to differ with the right george bush out of his own lack of rootedness politically and out of his own political timidity will not take on the far right they have defeated him too often george bush was for too many times in his career frustrated by the far right and he has decided that since he could not beat them that he will make obeyances to them and he has done that at every critical point in this year and in the last critical years at this point i am pleased to yield to the gentleman from new york my friend who i know has things he wants to add on this general subject"], [5.0902366638183594e-05,

from the christian science monitor feb 11 1988 dauo charges hit top harian officer by e a wayne wasingtonm united states attorneys in miami are preparing to indict a senior haitian military figure on drug trafficking charges according to unitedstates and haitian exile sources col jeanclaude paul commander of the powerful dessaline battalion in haitis capital has been under suspicion of drug smuggling since 1986 sources say but only recently have investigators compiled enough evidence to proceed with grandjury activity and possible indictment ile would apparently be charged with aiding the flow of colombian cocaine to the unitedstates and of arms from the unitedstates to colombia sources say some sources say an indictment is imminent but given secrecy of the process others are unsure if colonel paul is indicted the case will severely challenge haitian president leslie manigat who has pledged a crackdown on drug smugglers though unitedstates officials were unwilling to discuss the judicial investigation they said an indictment could call into question the arrangements by which mr manigat came to power if he tries to fire paul unitedstates congressional sources say that will view this as a serious litmus test of civilian control in haiti and of how the unitedstates should deal with the new regime pauls unit is viewed as the most important in the country and his troops are fiercely loyal to him unitedstates officials say this makes it very difficult for haitis president or pauls nominal military superiors to move against him wellinformed haitians say paul has warned that he will not go down alone if others try to remove him paul allegedly played a major role in directing violence that upset the november elections in haiti because of close ties to the tonton macoutes the secret police created during the duvalier dictatorship the violence and killing paved the way for manigats election last month paul is seen as very close to the gen william regala who was no 2 man in haitis transitional junta and may be named defense minister he is the muscle and regala is the brain says a haitian opposition source but paul has an independent power base since becoming commander of the dessaline barracks in early 1986 he has assiduously wooed his troopsdining with them wearing fatigues like theirs supplementing their pay with bonuses allegedly funded from drug trafficking washington sources say they will kill at his command a haitian opposition source says paul has also reportedly incorporated several thousand tonton macoutes into his unit making it even more formidable us officials say hes got all the guns one us specialist says washington first raised reports of pauls activities in the transitional haitian government in 1986 but received no satisfactory reply officials say after the initial us complaints an internal haitian military investigation was launched haitian exile sources say the final report reportedly confirmed the charges and included aerial photos of pauls farm with a private landing strip but after the army chief of staff presented it to gen henri namphy the thenacting head of government the investigating officers were reportedly transferred and accused of plotting a coup the army chief of staff and the colonel in charge of the investigation were subsequently forced to retire us officials could not confirm the haltians charges while stressing their lack of knowledge of the us judicial investigation they say earlier us intelligence indicates paul is alleged to have taken over parts of the drugtrafficking ring once reportedly run by the fatherinlaw of mr duvalier pauls brother alexander former haitian consul in miami is reported to have been in that earlier operation and the current one they say colombian cocaine and marijuana were reportedly the staples of this trade informed haitians here say that paul is well tied into the tonton macoutes in part because his father was in the personal entourage of franqois duvalier who founded the group to keep the military and opponents in line pauls reported ill deeds go beyond drugs a reuter dispatch from haiti reports that he and his two brothers arranged to receive the 4 000 tons of waste from the city of philadelphia dumped on the haitian coast line near the port of gonaives in january haiti opposition sources have provided the monitcr with what appears to be an import authorization from haitis minister of commerce for the paul brothers to import 20 million kilograms of usorigin ash free of inspection unloading of the ash stopped after local residents vigorously complained news reports from haiti indicate the waste may contain high levels of dioxin press reports say the paul brothers reportedly received 200 a ton to accept the ash washington will be watching carefully how the haitian government reacts if the indictments are issued the us has cut off all but humanitarian aid and antidrug cooperation with haiti until democratic elections are held senior us officials have made clear that they will judge the new government by its acts us officials believe manigat was elected after striking a deal with the military reports from haiti sources say indicate general namphy who headed the transitional government will be named chief of staff and general regala who was namphys no 2 will become defense minister martial celestine an associate of manigat was named prime minister tuesday us officials an congressional activists doubt that manig can move against paul alone they also wonder if namphy and regaia have the will or courage to act against their powerful colleague but if the haitian government does move against paul the ball will be back in washingtons court and it will be hard to avoid expressing

travel to communist nicaragua and as amended by the gentleman from new hampshire it specifically blocked travel for those people who wanted to go to nicaragua to help the communist dictatorship militarily in other words under this amendment which passed by 213 to 201 it is not appropriate for americans to go to nicaragua to help the communist dictatorship militarily a number of my colleagues asked why this mattered and i want to take just a moment or two to talk about this amendment first of all i would recommend to every american looking at a book called the real secret war sandinistas political warfare and its effects on congress by francis bouchey michael waller and steve baldwin that book indicates clearly that there is a systematic soviet cuban and nicaraguan communist effort to influence the american congress to influence american politics and to frame the debate second i would say to my friends we are engaged in a long struggle with the soviet empire the soviet empire is the active enemy of freedom and the active enemy of america sometimes we engaged in that struggle openly as we were in the korean war and in vietnam sometimes we are engaged in that struggle covertly as we are to some extent in afghanistan probably the most open covert war in modem history sometimes it helps our side to have an american embassy in the country as it does in nicaragua and other times it is better to break diplomatic relations there is a systematic thorough soviet kgb cuban nicaraguan communist effort to establish soviet communist colonies in central america in the real secret war by bouchey et al they indicate clearly for example the degree to which the soviet union directs the cuban secret police in other documents which we have captured we know for example that cuban and nicaraguan diplomats in the united nations systematically try to manipulate american politics and the american news media all that we were saying in todays vote was that the united states should establish a policy that like lafayette whose picture is in this chamber we help freedom we help the forces of freedom we are opposed to communism we oppose the forces of communism in particular as a first step in this long march toward a free world we are not willing to allow wellmeaning but misguided americans on the left to go to a country to put on a uniform to carry a weapon that it should be against the law for americans to get a passport to go to help a communist dictatorship tragically two of the potential presidential candidates voted against that amendment two of them democrats who are running for president one announced one exploring decided to vote to allow americans to go to nicaragua to fight for a communist dictatorship on the side of communism i would suggest that is not an issue of freedom of speech it is not an issue of right of travel it is a fundamental question of whether should some day american troops go into nicaragua as they went into grenada as they might have gone into iran when our hostages were held what would happen then to that young american who foolishly had put on a nicaraguan uniform what would the relationship be then of those young wellmeaning americans who had been blinded into being procommunist who were standing there with a soviet ak47 and then what would this congress say whose side would this congress be on the young american in an american uniform doing what an american president asked him or the young american in a communist uniform carrying soviet weapons it is madness for us engaged in a longterm war with the soviet empire for us trying to preserve freedom across the planet for us trying to slowly and systematically help people be free it is madness for us to allow some of our children to be convinced they should carry soviet weapons work with soviet advisers create soviet dominated dictatorships and this is a first step today by a narrow margin of 213 to 201 saying once again what john f kennedy knew

political prowess and her skills as a legislator the sala i knew and loved was larger then the sum of these parts 1 have asked myself over and over what made her so special and how can that specialness be expressed in brief remarks i have searched my thirty year recollection of her and what i find is a woman so secure in the knowledge of her own humanity so secure in knowledge of her own dignity and worth as a person that she would spend her life defending the dignity and worth of others sala was a woman who could talk to me when i was a young man about the worlds indifference to the approaching holocaust and of her own personal experiences of eastern european antisemitism and of fleeing poland she could do so without hate but with a fierce determination that the story be told for sala this bitter lesson of the past must be alive in our memory so that this most heinous crime against humanity can never happen again she told me the story sala was a woman who lived rather than preached the values of her jewish heritage in her struggle for peace in the world for an end to the arms race for a world freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation in her opposition to the immoral practice of hiring mercenaries by funding the contras in nicaragua there can be heard the echoes of the prophet isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and nations shall make war no more in salas ceaseless quest for a just and more humane society a society which recognizes its obligations to the poor the aged the infirmed the homeless and all who are dispossessed in this land she made tangible the words of micah you have been told 0 man what is good and what is required of you to live justly to show mercy and to walk humbly with your god for sala accidents of race color creed national origin ancestry gender or sexual orientation could never be excuses for denying the inherent dignity of the human person and her life is summed up in the struggle to make that ideal a reality it was sala who introduced me to the reality of racial discrimination and racism and who educated me and formed my conscience on these issues as she involved me in the struggle for fair employment practices and fair housing in our state so many years ago it was sala who introduced me to the concept that the magnificent document we call the constitution of the united states protects all or it protects none it was sala who opened my eyes to the dangers of mccarthyslm and to its remnants in our society as we stood in union square and listened to phil then in the assembly call for the abolition of the house committee on un american activities some of us can still remember the picture of the hoses being turned on demonstrators and the water cascading down these very stain as dedicated civil libertarians were dragged down them for protesting the presence of that comnittee in our city and sala would feel deep anger at the sight of this injustice for sala was a woman whose conscience was so finely honed whose perceptions of social justice and human rights were so clear that she was truly a woman well ahead of her time she was a pioneer ever pressing forward ever encouraging the more fainthearted of us to follow where phil would move mountains by the shear volume of his knowledge and the weight of his arguments sala would touch the heart would prick the conscience would call us to be what we can and should be concerned and caring human beings when phil might seem preoccupied or distant in his singlemindedness sala was always the embodiment of care and concern they were a unique team their lives were both public and private and it is in the private moments that their great love and respect for one another was most evident and as i say these words i can envision phil even now reaching over and grasping her hand in a gesture which in life spoke volumes they are once again together they are once again an invincible team i have spoken of the sala i know with a very special affection it was she after all who suggested to phil many years ago that he hire me on a six month trial that six months stretched into twenty five rewarding years in which i learned from them that the purpose of public life is service that power is always exercised in behalf of the powerless and that those who possess the platform for public debate have the obligation to eloquently and forcefully express the aspiration of those in our society who are voiceless that is my story of sala burton the sala i will remember every time i see the faces of the people she saw and whose dignity she defended it is my prayer that the god of abraham our god who blessed her and kept her in life who made his continence to shine upon her with a special radiance will now grant her peace sala we loved you we will remember you and we will retell you story for years to come"], [0.00011715303844539449, 0.00011715303844539449, 0, "this is a tribute to trent lott

the gentleman who preceded me and i would like to point out a few parts of the picture that were left a little blank in the discussion first of all the gentleman from michigan indicated that these people in nicaragua are alleged to be communists the fact of the matter is they are marxistleninists they are marxistleninists by their actions and by their words as well as by their deeds there is just no question about that when we were in managua about 6 or 7 weeks ago and the gentleman from california congressman dornan and i went over there to see lino hernandez who is a human rights activist who was jailed because he appeared at a demonstration he did not participate he just appeared at a demonstration and they threw him in jail without benefit of any kind of a trial we went over to see him and while we were waiting in the police chiefs office congressman dornan pointed out to me over my left shoulder a large picture of lenin and over my right shoulder was a large picture of karl marx those were not hanging there just for aesthetic reasons they were there because that police chief as well as all those in leadership down there are avowed marxistleninists daniel ortega just got back from moscow where he participated in celebrating the 70th anniversary of the bolshevik revolution with gorbachev with fidel castro and others there is no question they are a communist organization they are a communist government there is no question that they plan to export revolution into the surrounding countries and that they have been doing that in el salvador i was in chalatenango province i saw captured communist weapons i talked to captured communist guerrillas who told me they were trained in nicaragua that their weapons came through nicaragua no question about that in addition to that during the attack by the m1 guerrillas in colombia last year when they killed members of the supreme court down there there were found among the dead members of the sandinista military participating with the m1 guerrillas and trying to undermine the government in columbia no question it is a communist regime now what happens if the peace process fails and the contras dry up and blow away because we do not give them funding we all want peace to work in central america we all want to give peace a chance but if it does not work there should be a viable alternative to the communist sandinista government now my friends on the other side of the aisle would have it that the contras would no longer get funding they would become members of the united states of america flee to the united states or stay and go to honduras and live in refugee camps or go back and under the state of amnesty become part of the sandinista government or part of the sandinista citizenry many of them no doubt will be taken to task imprisoned or killed down the road but the fact of the matter is that they would have it that there would be no viable opposition to the sandinistas if the peace process fails because they do not want any further contra aid my feeling is that the peace process although it should be given a chance is likely to fail if you talk to the other central american leaders they are filled with apprehension as well congressman dornan and i met with president azcona in his presidential residence and he told us that he had told senator chris dodd that if the peace process failedand he had great apprehension about itthat he was going to request 50 000 americantroops be stationed in his country he was also going to request up to 250 million in military assistance so he has apprehension about it president duarte of el salvador is very apprehensive about it when we talked to them privately about whether or not contras should be funded so that they could remain a viable force in case the peace process fails they say yes they should at the very least get humanitarian aid so that they will be able to survive and there will be some alternative to the sandinistas if the peace process does not work my friends on the other side of the aisle would have it that the contras no longer be a viable force and if the peace process fails there would be no way to do anything about the communists sandinistas and their expansionist policies throughout central america they have been exporting revolution in the past as congressman dornan of california said a while ago the thing that got them back to the conference table esquipulas ii was the gains that had been made by the freedom fighters the contras on the field of battle this year the pressure had been increased on them and tomas borge and others have said privately that they are a threat to the sandinista government and therefore they went to the conference table now after having gone to the conference table and signing it they are trying to buy time they are not complying with all facets of the peace agreement there is no question about that they released 1 000 political prisoners or promised to release them there are 5 000 to 6 000 political prisoners in those jails down there congressman dornan and i talked to mothers and wives and daughters of these political prisoners and with tears flowing down their cheeks they talked about the torture and the repression that their husbands and sons and brothers were feeling in those prisons real torture 0l 2140 and there are over 5 000 of them so they are going to release 1 000 and say they are complying with the peace agreement not on your life in addition to that they said they were going to allow la prensa to print well that was a step in the right direction and we all applauded that they said they were going to let radio catolica broadcast again radio catolica did not have the power that was necessary and one member of our body here went down there with radio equipment and helped fix that radio station so it could broadcast not only in managua but all the way down to costa rica and all the way up to guatemala the signal is now very strong lino hernandez went on that radio station to give a news report on the human rights violations that were taking place at the hand of the sandinistas and they immediately once again imposed censorship on news broadcasts on radio catolica they cannot broadcast news today so once again they are not complying with the peace agreement as i said before i think president ortega in nicaragua is trying to buy time and what are they doing with the young people down there i did not bring all of my information over tonight because i did not intend to get into this lengthy discussion on this subject but they are teaching young children to add and subtract using military equipment instead of apples and oranges so two ak47s plus two machineguns plus two machineguns are six machineguns and three hand grenades plus three hand grenades are six hand grenades and as the children get older the indoctrination gets more severe so that they will have a solid corps of young people to throw into the field of battle at some point in the future they are building their army toward a 250 000man active army and militia they have reached their goal of 139 000 right now which is far greater than pny of the other central american countries in fact probably greater than all those countries combined and yet they continue to build because they felt pressure on the battlefield they have decided to sign the peace agreement to buy time we all hope it works but if it does not work there should be a viable alternative to the communist sandinistas and their objectives down in central america my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said that oscar arias received the nobel peace prize and that jim wright should be a corecipient because of his participation in the peace proposal well if the peace proposal does not work i hope mr wright our speaker is equally willing to accept the responsibility for the failed plan of course we hope it works but if it does not if you

special friend she was a wonderful woman sala burton was a wonderful wife too i was fortunate enought to be a friend of both phil and sala i met phil in the late sixties here and he helped me to get

the great legislator the powerful individual with a heart even bigger than that huge body he had and sala that loved him that was his true partner and how he loved her too at the funeral service in san francisco there were those that recalled how sala would calm the troubled waters that phil had passed by and she had that gift we will all miss sala she was a woman of great conviction as another member just said today she was so proud of her jewishness she cared so much for the poor and for those that needed help and that was why i particularly liked both phil and sala they were legislators that cared and never forgot why they had come here when sala came into this body as an elected representative many thought perhaps that this was just sala burton the devoted wife and partner of phil coming here but she sure showed us she was a very very effective member of this house and legislator in the short period that she was here now we will miss her she was a wonderful woman she was a wonderful wife a great legislator and a great friend the sorrow of losing sala burton will be slow to pass but we can take heart knowing the inspiration of salas life and convictions also will be slow to pass her commitment to peace social justice and equality for all knew no compromise we must keep that commitment before us as we wrestle with the hard decisions that face us in this hall but salas inspiration goes far beyond the political realm as we usually know it her political beliefs crew directly out of her compassionate and caring personality it was wonderfully typical of salawhose political causes spanned continentsthat she found time to lend a hand to the small territory of the virgin islands she and her late husband phil were abiding political allies and personal friends for more than 20 years over the yearseven as they worked tirelessly for peace and civil rights and national parklands for allthey extended their concerns to the virgin islands and other offshore territories thanks to leaders like sala and phil we in the islands have won basic rights to elect our governors and gain representation in congress sala and phil had nothing to gain from this sort of

provision had been law that maybe hinckley would not have been able to acquire the firearm that he used back in 1981maybe maybe not because as i understand it mr hinckley did not have a felony record mr hinckley had not been adjudged mentally ill and therefore under these provisions would not have been denied the right to purchase a firearm i think that we have to recognize that another thing is just the mechanics of this amendment i do not know how many of my colleagues have looked at the mechanics of it let us look at my state last spring i acquired a handgun out in my hometown and what do we have to do in the state of missouri we have to acquire obtain a permit from our local sheriff well the sheriff knows me we are pretty good friends and he does not really think that i need to have my background checked maybe some of my colleagues do anyway i inquired of the sheriff and i finally got the gun i wanted and i gave him the information went up there and iln a few minutes got my permit went back to the dealer and turned it over to him ie made out the registration and i acquired my gun it is that simple what must be done under this well not only can the dealer not do what he can now do in missouri but that dealer is going to have to fill out all the information take it down to the post office because you have got to send it by certified or registered mail where is the post office in hannibal mo right across the street from the courthouse where the sheriff has his office but he has got to go down there and send it by registered mail over to the courthouse or maybe he is supposed to send it to the police chief well where is the police chief located he is right next door to the post office what sense does it make to make them go through all those machinations and does anybody here that has drifted this thing realize what rural areas of this country look like what goes on in those rural areas do my colleagues really think that philadelphia mo is the same as philadelphi a pa e 1515 i assure you that it is not in any way and tte same idea that by enacti 7 this law you are going to make it safer for people out here on the streets is so absurd that it is not even funny you are trying to fool the people because you are not going to make it any safer crooks are still going to get their guns they are still going to use their guns they are not going to stop using them because of this so i urge you to support the mecollum ar ndment it is the only sensible thing to do let us let each state decide what they want to do as far as gun control legislation is

and adopting h r 28 the expedited funds availability act under the leadership of chairman st germain the banking committee reported out what i consider to be an exemplary consumer protection measure i would like to commend chairman st germain for his diligence and patience in pursuing this measure and for his willingness to consider all sides of the issue representatives carper and shumway also deserve credit for working with the chairman in producing this impressive consumer measure before us today the problem this legislation tackles is one that im sure is one many members of congress have heard complaint of although it is not a problem with banks in columbus i am pleased to say some financial institutions impose unreasonably long hold periods on funds deposited by check these holds prevent depositors from withdrawing funds one witness said sometimes for periods as long as 3 weeks while the institution itself has the use of these funds usually within 1 or 2 days after the deposit is made unreasonably long hold periods not only inconvenience depositors but can also cause severe hardship the depository institutions explain that hold periods are necessary to protect them from checks that bounce or are returned for insufficient funds h r 28 seeks to remedy that by directing the federal reserve to expedite the check return process specifically at the end of a 3year phasein period the permanent availability schedule provides that all local checks be made available for withdrawal after no more than 1 intervening businses day while nonlocal checks must be available after no more than 4 intervening business days moreover the legislation provides for next day availability for deposits made by government checks checks of 100 and under bankissued checks such as certified checks and checks drawn on the same institution to strike a balance protections are also afforded the depository institution the availability schedules do not apply to deposits made during the first 30 days after an account is opened by a new depositor or to that portion of a deposit which exceeds 5 000 in the aggregate in any one business day i am pleased that an amendment which i offered at the request of treasury in the 99th congress to provide for a 1year statute of limitations on the time period in which treasury can return government checks to banks that paid those checks over a forged or unauthorized endorsement was adopted that period is now 6 years in conclusion i believe that h r 28 represent needed legislation and that it succeeds in providing a solution to a very pressing

regulatory program was to prevent the construction of surplus hospital space and the unnecessary purchase of expensive hospital facilities and equipment and in that way to bring down the countrys rapidly escalating health care costs the act imposed a system of government approval and disapproval on the acquisition of capital assets by hospitals throughout the country at first glance the idea may have looked pretty good in practice however the effect of certificatecfneed on health care costs has been dubious at best and the program has certainly been insensitive in many instances to the true needs of our communities an example of this insensitivity is unfolding right now in my own eighth district of georgia the citizens of putnam county are proud of their 20yearold community hospital they built it with local funding without using any federal hillburton funds and they still support it locally they are proud enough to have recently approved a 1cent sales tax to renovate the facility they are not seeking an expansion the hospital has always had 50 beds and thats what they propose to maintain however when putnam county authorities went to the state health planning agency for the required approval under the certificateofneed program this year they ran into unexpected trouble the agency looked over the request for the locally funded hospital improvements and decided to deny itunless the hospital eliminated 10 beds putnam county protested although the hospital is not currently utilizing all of its beds growth projections in the area indicate that the 50 beds will eventually be needed in any event there is no significant savings to be realized by eliminating the 10 beds its true medicare helps pay for interest and depreciation on hospital construction but a 10bed cutback would have virtually no impact on health costs it would however reduce the number of nursing students who could be enrolled in the hospitals lpn program at a time when the country has a critical shortage of nurses and it would be much more costly when the county has to add back those 10 beds at some point in the future eliminating the beds would however enable the state health planning agency to get the number more in line with what it believes the quota should be for that region in my view its a classic case of a bureacracy paying more attention to numbers on a piece of paper than to reality and the reality is the harmful impact this would have on the community without doing anything significant to cut costs although i believe the people at the state health planning agency are sincere i also recognize they are tied to a system that is often highhanded and arrogant federal funding for certificateofneed programs was ended in 1987 and 12 states have now abandoned the program altogether its now time to abolish it throughout the nation if anyone wants to know why just ask the people of putnam county"], [0.00012746453285217285, 0.4998725354671478, 1, "the remarks
