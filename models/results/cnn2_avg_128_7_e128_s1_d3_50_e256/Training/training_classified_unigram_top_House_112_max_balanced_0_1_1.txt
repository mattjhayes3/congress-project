{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "1 year after the deepwater horizon oil spill americans are paying record gas prices in northern virginia gas that used to cost 3 per gallon now costs more than 4 per gallon this gas price hike is a result of instability in the middle east and possible oil speculation and is a reminder of our dangerous dependence on foreign oil sadly our republican colleagues are not advancing legislation to help our hardpressed consumers their plan would line the pockets of big oil which saw its profits skyrocket 30 percent in line with rising gas prices fortunately there are positive steps we can take to promote energy independence in america and to protect consumers improve vehicle efficiency boost production of domestic renewable energy and convert oil industry tax breaks into gas price relief for our consumers america owns 1 5 percent of the worlds oil but consumes 22 5 percent so we cant drill our way to energy independence the only way to end our dependence on foreign oil and reduce gas prices is by improving automobile efficiency and developing new sources of clean domestic energy energy independence is going to depend on reducing our oil consumption and shifting to domestic forms of energy like wind solar biofuels and gas energy independence will save consumers money and protect us from the instability of the middle east at the end of 2010 congress extended tax credits for biofuels and the production of wind and solar energy these tax credits increased wind energy production by nearly 43 percent in just 2 years so extending them is an important step to increasing the supply of domestic energy under the authority of the clean air act president obama and automakers recently announced an agreement to improve the efficiency of automobiles by 30 percent by 2016 this agreement will save consumers 3 000 for each car purchased 5 years from now here is another way of looking at it if you could save 30 percent at the pump better vehicle efficiency would more than offset the recent spike in gas prices unfortunately oil companies and their allies here in congress are trying to roll back much of this progress republican speaker boehner forced through legislation which would repeal much of the clean air act hurting american consumers and undermining our national security last week the leadership in the house passed legislation to shortcircuit safety rules for oil production off americas coasts increasing the likelihood of another deepwater horizon catastrophe their legislation would also allow oil exploration that would impede naval operations off the chesapeake bay in virginia this week they want to attempt to pass a bill allowing for more oil drilling even if it interferes with military bases or endangers coastal economies i do not support reckless efforts to allow unregulated oil drilling which endangers coastal economies and national security last week i introduced amendments to these oil drilling bills one would strike the antisafety language and add a provision to repeal 37 billion in oil company tax loopholes the amendment would remit this money to american drivers averaged among licensed drivers my amendment would give 185 to every licensed driver in america reducing the equivalent price of gasoline by 27 cents a gallon the other amendment was written to protect national security it simply requires that the commander in chief in consultation with the secretary of defense certify that before we drill for oil off the coast of virginia that it does not hamper national security and naval operations i was shocked that all but a handful of republicans voted to kill this commonsense amendment since the leadership has blocked efforts to include real gas price relief in their oil drilling bills i am introducing standalone legislation to assist consumers the bill entitled the gas price relief act would terminate tax loopholes for oil companies while rebating the savings to our hardpressed commuters throughout america there are many positive steps we can take to reduce our de pendence on foreign oil steps that will include clean energy renewable energy and efficiency in our vehicles thats the path we need to take if we are going to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and achieve genuine energy independence"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "14 hours from now it appears

who need early childhood education i dont want to take the money from families that need help paying for colleges and i dont want to take the money from seniors who need medical care i want to cut the gobs and gobs of money nearly 7 billion every single month were spending to occupy a foreign nation and have our servicemen killed and maimed by insurgents you want to eliminate wasteful government spending i say the war in afghanistan could be number one on our list ten years after we started sending our troops there we continue to be stuck in a hopeless quagmire that doesnt doing anything to eliminate the terrorist threat or accomplish our national security goals but of course the republican leadership wont consider cutting more spending instead they want to go after middle class working

including two 16yearold boys in chicago this year alone over 200 people have been killed in shootings and nationwide every day 34 people are killed by guns in the hours following the horrific tragedy in colorado we paused to reflect and send our prayers to families grieving an unimaginable loss but now is the time to have a national discussion about how to stem these epidemic levels of gun violence i wish this tragedy in aurora were an isolated incident but it seems to be part of a recurring pattern 19 people were shot and eight were killed in tucson in 2011 29 people were shot and 13 died at fort hood in 2009 21 people were shot and five were killed at northern illinois university in 2008 and 17 people were wounded while 32 people died at virginia tech in 2007 when will we have enough when will we stand up and say we may not be able to stop every crime but we can stop some of them and at least minimize the damage of others the gun lobby doesnt want us to have this conversation first they accuse anyone who tries to spark a national debate about how to mitigate gun violence with exploiting the deaths of innocent people yet no one was accused of exploitation when after hurricane katrina we discussed how to improve femas emergency response or after a deadly salmonella outbreak when we debated how to improve public safety after such national tragedies society should engage in a discussion about how to address and potentially prevent such tragedies from happening again we might not all agree but this is a democracy and this is how public policy is made next the gun lobby seeks to stymie debate by arguing that guns dont kill people people kill people i dont buy this argument i dont buy that theres nothing we can do to stop criminals and the mentally ill from killing if they want to sure we cant stop them with 100 percent certainty but we can make it a lot harder for wouldbe assassins we can ensure every gun is purchased after a background check rather than only 60 percent of guns as is the current case and we can reduce the fatality rate by banning assault rifles and highcapacity magazines that are designed exclusively for killing dozens of people at once finally the gun lobby tries to argue that any attempt to regulate gun access is an attempt to restrict all gun access this is simply not true there is such a thing as commonsense middleground gun reform and most gun owners support it eightyone percent of gun owners support requiring a background check on all firearm purchases yet 40 percent of unitedstates gun sales are conducted by private sellers who are not required to perform background checks these private sellers operate at gun shows where anyone can walk in and buy whatever gun they want convicted felons domestic abusers the severely mentally ill and even people on the terrorist watch list canand dogo into gun shows and buy any gun they want ninety percent of all americans also support strengthening databases to prevent the mentally ill from buying guns but sadly 10 states have still failed to flag a single person as mentally ill in the national background check database and 17 other states have fewer than 100 people listed as mentally ill over 1 million disqualifying mental health records are still missing from the database finally we must have a conversation about getting assault weapons and highcapacity magazines machines designed exclusively for killing people off the streets when you have a 100round clip on your gun you are not protecting your home you are hunting people lets be clear this is not about restricting anyones second amendment rights the supreme court has ruled and made clear the right of americans to own guns but while reaffirming the second amendment the court was careful to note that the amendment is not limitless justice scalia explained in columbia v heller that like most rights the second amendment is not unlimited it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose can we stop every shooting no but can we reduce their frequency and deadliness absolutely can we do it while still respecting the second amendment of this i am certain but the first step toward keeping dangerous guns out of the hands of dangerous people is to begin the conversation lets break the silence stop the violence

island by authorizing highway and transit programs through 2014 unfortunately in order to secure an agreement the conferees included some provisions in this bill with which i disagree i am disappointed that the legislation threatens critical environmental funding and protections and fails to expand funding for the land and water conservation fund which provides matching grants for our state to acquire land and water for the benefit of all rhode islanders i will work to restore these resources in the future but on balance this is a good agreement that will benefit communities and workers across our state i am also pleased that this measure prevents the stafford loan interest rate from doubling to 6 8 percent on july 1 for 7 million college students saving them 1 000 over the life of their loans however i am concerned that the bill cuts the student loan program by limiting the amount of time a student qualifies for a loan to 150 percent of the programs length and eliminates the sixmonth interest subsidy grace period after a student has graduated too many studentsespecially those from lowincome familiesface unnecessary barriers to pursuing a college degree and

community in that compact that really puts together the vision and the need the compact that expresses the need for manufacturing now there are those who would suggest that manufacturing is dead that weve seen our heyday that its over that its history well when you talk to americas manufacturers they will tell you that they need to develop the human infrastructure that they need todays skills to meet todays competition they will tell you about doing it smarter so as to be that sharpest competitor on the global scene and they will talk about innovation just how does innovation happen its taking ideas and moving them along investing in r d building a prototype developing that impact in manufacturing and making certain that we are at the cutting edge that were investing with americas brainpowerits knowhowthat were pulling together the intellectual capacity and making it work but when we introduce innovation we need people with the skill set to run these automated mechanisms in the manufacturing line so it is absolutely essential its so vitally important to develop the skill set the knowhow in order to put people to work and make us competitive its happening as we speak mr kintz

proposed cuts will inflict on our economy while speaking on abc he said unemployment will be higher than it would have been otherwise growth will be lower than it would have been otherwise and inequality will be worse than it would have been otherwise he added we have a very weak economy withdrawing more spending at this stage is going to make it even weaker todays agreement will endanger

we think really will propel america back to the leading edge of the worlds economies weve had some tough times but weve seen some progress if we can once again make it in america were going to see this economy grow were going to see the middle class come back to life were going to see an expansion of wealth and the opportunity for families to make it in america when we make things in america let me just start off this discussion with the progress thats been made some of our colleagues here would like to say that nothing good has happened over the last 3 years when in fact this chart which is from the department of labor statistics office points out very very clearly where we have come from since the great recession began if you take a look at this the gold columns over on the far leftor far right depending on your perspectiveyou can see the great decline that took place from 2007 until january and february of 2009 when president obama came into office since that time weve seen a steady improvement in the number of jobs in america so even though we were seeing here in this particular 2009 period a continued decline each week that went by we saw improvements less of a falloff and we began to emerge from the depths of the great recession so beginning here in about 2010 we began to turn around and we began to see positive job growth every month since that time we have seen positive job growth in americanot enough not enough to satisfy any of us on the democratic side and not enough im sure on the republican side and certainly as president obama said when he appeared here at the state of the union not enough to satisfy the president so were now looking at the presidents budget going forward proposed came to the congress yesterday that budget lays out how he would like america to move forward and how we in the house of representatives and the senate can put into place the laws the programs and the money to pay for the advancement of the american economy so were going to spend tonight building off the presidents budget and the things that are in there over the last year my colleagues and i have been talking about the key ladders to success those things that create opportunity in america and certainly theyre education its the research its the manufacturing the infrastructure and the opportunities that come with them tonight wed like to start by focusing on one part of the presidents budget which was the r d the research and development portion of the presidents budget now in any economy if youre going to grow that economy you have to stay in the forefront of technologies america has been the best in the world at this and in doing so we have created extraordinary growth in the economy and opportunities for new businesses unfortunately in the last 20 years weve seen those businesses go offshore but the genesis of that growth is often in the research and development usually funded by the federal government and that research and development comes in several different parts of the federal budgets certainly we see it in health care the national institutes of health we see it in the national science in the energy department and in the military each of those organizations has a research budget and from that budget comes new innovation new products for example the defense research agency known around here as darpa really did the grunt work the initial development and research to create the internet and weve certainly seen what that has meant to america now with that introduction 148 billion in the presidents budget for all the research and development that the federal government supports gives us the opportunity to create the new solutions to todays health problems todays economic problems energy issues and defense issues fortunately my two colleagues today are wellsteeped and very very knowledgeable about the research budget my colleague from new york ran a research program in new york share with us and then if youll reflect on the presidents budget"], [0.9848816394805908, 0.9848816394805908, 0, "for whom i have a great deal of respect knows that it makes no sense in fact many of your folks who have said to

bill that cuts billions in scientific research kicks 200 000 children out of head start and cuts college aid for millions of middle class students yes we dont agree with those priorities theyre not
