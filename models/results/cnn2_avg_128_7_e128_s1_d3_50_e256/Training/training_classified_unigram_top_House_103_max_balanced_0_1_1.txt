{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "it is with great sadness that i rise as the chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus to mourn the death of cesar chavez for more than three decades cesar chavez symbolized the voice for political awareness among latinos he carried the cry for farm workers rights to the fields of california and echoed the call for la causa the struggle to raise political consciousness and deliver justice to all latinos with every breath cesar chavez brought passion to his quest for justice but his triumphs sharpened the bittersweet taste of organizing and unionizing the migrant workers a step forward in the march was often matched by a step backward success often mixed with suffering it was in 1962 that cesar chavez took out his life savings and first organized the national farm workers association in the san joaquin valleys agricultural town of delano by september of the same year the nfwa held its first formal meeting in fresno with 287 participants who came to listen to the powerful ideas of the farm workers rights movement lead by the inspiration of cesar chavez along the thousands of miles traveled through the california farm land chavez brought the message of farm workers unity and unionization during the late 1960s and early 1970s the ufws membership reached its peak with over 70 000 members in 1975 chavez delivered his most important legacy to the farm workers rights movement successfully campaigning for the landmark agricultural labor relations act which permitted farm workers to organize and bargain collectively for the first time the grape pickers struggle took center stage in what chavez called la huelgaa series of strikes a call for adequate living conditions and higher wages and a stop to the exploitation and injustice suffered by latinos chavez is also responsible for one of the first and largest consumer boycotts persuading millions of consumers to voluntarily abstain from buying california grapes the boycott gave consumers an active role in opposing the injustices against farm workers across the country throughout his life cesar chavez brought to the public eye the existence of mexicanamericans as a growing and vibrant population more than just the political movement chavez created a moral spiritual and cultural world for mexicanamericans to explore with each and every march chavez continued to challenge all mexicanamericans to engage in an active search for their own cultural identity by the 1970s the term chicanismo the identification of latinos of mexican decent as a symbiosis of hispanic indigenous and american culturesfirst appeared in the lingo of the time chicano art brought nourishment to the spirit of farm workers and to urban life cesar chavez was the inspiration for the teatro campesino which made its debut at the picket lines among the farm workers it was luis valdez agustin lira and others that colored with music and drama with the fight chavez would come to epitomize chavez gave writers painters and other artists the strength and inspiration to express the chicano and latino struggle for equality he gave latinos a voice a spirit and a dream the means to speak a common language through the words of the working poor cesar chavez spoke in a language that was as dear to puerto ricans as it was to mexicanamericans i recall my late father who had walked the picket line on behalf of the sheet metal workers in the bronx it was my father who often expressed to me and my brother that the one power the working poor have is the right to strike it was with these ideas that cesar chavez became part of the puerto rican struggle in the east coast chavez encountered many impediments throughout his struggle but fought his opponent only through words and nonviolent philosophy in 1969 chavez said if the strike means the blood of one grower or one growers son or one worker or one workers son then it isnt worth it in 1968 chavez began a 25day fast chavez explained his actions by saying it was an act of penance recalling workers to the nonviolent roots of their movement even though his fasting lead to physical deterioration it powerfully communicated the hunger for dignity of the farm worker to every one present today and for the thousands of farm workers in the united states it is difficult to express through words the sorrow felt throughout this nation like martin luther king jr who organized africanamericans in the south to stand up against injustice and discrimination cesar chavez stood up against injustice and discrimination cesar chavez stood up against oppression and exploitation in the agricultural fields of california but chavezs greatest accomplishment was to unite the latinos in this country who are children of the earth share the common land to sow and with one united voice await the season when justice may be reaped for the betterment of all as a humble voice among latinos i take great pride in honoring the memory of cesar chavez in memory of you cesar we pledge to keep your voice alive and with your words i make the call viva la huelga viva la causa viva la union thank you cesar you will never be forgotten i yield to the gentleman from new mexico"], [2.9260485701065875e-10, 2.9260485701065875e-10, 0, "i hope the members back in their offices are listening they ought to get over here on this floor and watch because the american people are watching and you are about to witness one of the most outrageous charades ever attempted on the floor of this house here are 432 pages of testimony of conscientious members of this house republicans and democrats who have been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership 40some denied their rights on the floor of this house you are about to see the taxers the spenders the regulators who control this house the democrat leadership attempt to convince you and the american people that the bill that pays for the operation of this congress has been substantially reduced i get so exercised when i see this mr speaker and members that is an outrageous charade this bill does not reduce spending on we the congress it does not reduce spending by 20 percent by 10 percent by 5 percent not even 2 percent this bill authorizes spending on we the congress of 1 800 000 000 almost 2 billion and yes the taxers and the spenders and the regulators who run this place have magnanimously cut this legislative budget by about 1 percent well isnt that big of them what do you think about that mr and mrs america typically president clinton and the democrat leadership are attempting to foist on the american people the largest tax increase in american history forcing each american family to cough up at least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse through this gag rule refusing to let rankandfile republicans and democratsand here they are democrats look at them you have been slapped by your democrat leadershiprefusing to allow republicans or democrats to even offer amendments that would significantly cut our legislative budget why is this a charade it is a charade because the democrat leadership in an 11thhour rules meeting yesterday kidded 40some members democrats and republicans alikehere they arewho came to us pleading to let them offer significant cutting amendments to the bill why is this a charade mr speaker because after listening to all of these members recite what their constituents were saying back home cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending the democratcontrolled rules committee turned down on a partyline vote all 46 of the significant cutting amendments offered by republicans and democrats alike amendments that would have cut several hundred million dollars from this bloated legislative expense budget that continues to hire 37 000 employees which i think is lust to make us look good why is this a charade mr speaker because after refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually or in total significantly reduce this legislative budget to show you what a charade this gag rule really is and why i am so exercised and why the american people are going to be so exercised if all six of these amendments pass all six that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that continues to raise their taxes so that they can spend the money on themselves that is exactly what we are doing here they have had it with a congress that continues to pass laws that regulate the american people but exempt the congress exempt themselves they have had it with you they have had it with a democrat leadership that refuses to allow rank and file republicans or democrats to offer amendments that would do what their constituents sent them here to do this year cut spending cut spending cut spending i cannot say it enough cut spending especially cut spending on themselves mr speaker and members i urge defeat of the rule so that democrats like the gentleman from minnesota a good conservative democrat most conscientious member on your side of the aisle and another democrat the gentleman from utah another very good member who has been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership and refused to be able to come on this floor and offer their significant amendments that would cut millions out of this budget and lord knows we can afford to cut millions out of this budget so that our republican leader the gentleman from illinois could offer his amendment which could cut anywhere between 12 and 25 percent you know they deserve the right to be able to come to this floor and do that mr speaker and members of this house that is what the american people want but it is what the democrat leadership does not want members who are you for are you for the democrat leadership or are you for the american people on behalf of the american people vote down this rule and let these members come on this floor and do what they were sent here to do represent their people i include the

today by bill clinton and the democrat majority in congress the budget proposal offered by the democrats is a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster it proposes to increase taxes at a time when americans are already overtaxed it proposes to increase taxes at a itime when we have a fragile economy higher taxes will only stifle job creation and economic growth it proposes to continue the path of excessive govemnment spending excessive spending is the reason our federal government is currently saddled with a massive debt depending on whose estimates you believe bill clinton is proposing to raise taxes anywhere from 250 billion to 315 billion no matter which figure you use if his proposal becomes law it will be the largest tax increase in the history of our nation moreover egardless of the exact figures his proposal taxes everyone from the small business owner to the social security recipient to the working middle income american family and we thought mr clinton was only going to sock it to the rich it is an absolute outrage that a man who actually promised middle american taxpayers a tax cut during the campaign can now turn around and unblushingly pr6pose to raise taxes in a magnitude of historic proportions mr clintons assertion that the reason he must now raise taxes is because the deficit figure is higherthan he anticipated during the campaign is quite frankly bull in fact last july during the campaign clinton predicted even higher deficitsup to 40u billionthan actually materialized moreover democrat budget committee members advising clinton during the campaign and working with their good friends at the congressional budget office certainly were well aware of what to expect in the way of deficit figures most conspicuous among those members is leon panetta former chairman of the housebudget committee and now clintons director of office of management and budget for clinton to rationalize raising taxes based on claims of new deficit figures is the height of hypocrisy this is just another example of mr clinton trying to be slick more importantly regardlessof what the actual deficit figures are t is excessive spending not insufficient tax revenues that has produced our gushing red ink indeed when you combine federal state and local taxes you find that the american taxpayer is already being taxed at alltime record high levels analyzing the federal budget over the past 12 years further drives home thepoint in 1980 revenues to the federal treasury were 500 billion by 1992 revenues had soared to 1 1 trillion a massive 600 billion increase in 12 years in other words in 12 years the american taxpayer shouldered an additional federal tax burden that was greater than the magnitude of the entire tax burden it took us over 200 years to reach one would think that the federal government could do just fine with 600 billion in new tax dollars each year but alas it isnt enough to quench the insatiable thirst of democrats in congress during that same timeframe federal expenditures rose frem 600 billion to nearly 1 4 trillionan increase of 800 billion this simply illustrates the historical fact that for every new dollar the treasury receives in taxes congress spends 1 60 more indeed the 1990 budget deal which had promised spending cuts for every dollar in new taxes instead resulted in congress spending an additional 2 37 for every dollar in new taxes republicans have been willing to make the hard choices and make the spendlng cuts how many times in the past 12 years have i seen this congress on a party ing vote reject republican amendments to trim as little as 1 percent from an appropriation bill how many times have i seen the democratcontrolled rules committee decide to prevent republlcant from offering amendments to cut spending and make economies indeed in that regard i was deeply disappointed that the democrats did not allow my good friend from indiana congressman dan burton to offer his budget freeze proposal i have long been an advocate of an across the board spending freeze mr burrons proposal would have made a bigger dent in the deficit than any of the proposals before us today moreover in my view mr burtons acrosstheboard freeze is the fairest way to spread the burden of spending cutseveryone who benefits from federal spending must tighten the belt however once again in an abuse of their uninterrupted control of the house of representatives for the past 40 years the democrats decided to gag the opposition rather than debate a viable alternative on its merits republicans have proposed viable alternatives and the budget proposal offered by my good fmlend john kasich is the kind of proposal that the american public deserves it proposes no tax increases and will cut the deficit significantly i can only hope that there are democrats in the house that can see the error of mr clintons ways and join republicans in supporting the kasich budget bill clinton has broken his promise to the american people as he has broken so many other promises in his short tenure mr clinton does not understad one basic factamericans are not undertaxedcongress is spending too much in my view bil clinton sold the american voter a bill of goods i am afraid that this president who received only 43 percent of the popular vote and this congress do not understand the nature of the problem as bill clinton should say its spending stupid"], [4.053302404827264e-08, 4.053302404827264e-08, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume my colleagues democrats and republicans alike fellow americans this is the showdown right now i voted for the amendment offered by the gentleman from ohio like a great many of my colleagues did over here and i was proud to do so but now that the kasich budget is no longer an option to this body my colleagues should know that this is the very last chance that democrats and republicans will have to strip the clinton proposal as i said before i was proud to vote for the kasich budget i am sorry it did not pass but now that it is no longer an option this is the very last chance that democrats on that side and republicans on this side will have to strip the clinton proposal of two of the most onerous and unfair taxes that this body could possibly levy on middleclass taxpayers and senior citizens and that is the btu energy tax that will drastically reduce the cost of food and gasoline and home heating fuel and every single piece of manufactured goods in america on our constituents and it will strip out the clinton social security tax increase that almost doubles the social security tax on retired american citizens you do mot want to do that why is this the last chance because if my amendment is defeated on this floor now your vote against my amendment guarantees that this unfair energy tax and the unfair social security tax will become law and your vote did it if members want to vote for this solomon consensus let me tell what it does first of all this solomon consensus will not raise taxes one dime it cuts taxes the clinton budget calls for 366 billion in new taxes andwe in the sol omon consensus cut taxes by 222 billion 222 billion by eliminating the increase in the energy tax by eliminating the social security tax by eliminating the corporate income tax and we cut president clintons tax increase further by changing his new tax bracket from 140 000 up to 200 000 of adjusted gross income before it kicks in that is a taxcut not a tax increase to stimulate the economy we provide for vital tax incentives we cut taxes further not raise them by extending expiring business tax incentives by restoring real estate passive loss that almost bankrupted the real estate industry in this country b years ago by providing capital gains tax deductions for startup companies which is badly needed and by repealing the luxury tax on boats that most members on that side of the aisle have sponsored and just about everybody on this side of the aisle has sponsored here is your chance to vote for it including the gentleman from michigan my good friend that cuts 222 billion out of the clinton tax increases leaving only this and i do not address this but it leaves in the clinton budget a surtax on millionaires it leaves some miscellaneous taxes to plug business expense loopholes and it leaves a limit on deductions for executive pay over 1 million if there is anything that could be construed as an income tax increase in this substitute here it is this we expand that limit of 1 million on executive pay to include movie stars and professional athletes who make 200 times what the average assembly line worker makes at ge in my district or general motors in your district two hundred times if members vote for the solomon amendment they remove the middleclas tax increase and put fairness back into the unitedstates tax code besides fairness the most important other issue in this budget and facing this congress and this nation is reducing the unconscionable deficit that is drowning this nation in a sea of red ink unfortunately the clinton budget even after raising taxes by 336 billion does little or nothing to reduce spending or to reduce that deficit over 5 years president clintons budget only cuts spending 219 billion with practically no cuts in the first 2 years and no procedures to guarantee that we get any cuts in the last 3 years members know we will not without grammrudman restrictions in there here is the real difference between the two bills the solomon plan more than doubles the clinton cuts cutting 265 billion more than clinton and it guarantees those cuts by requiring sequestration procedures that trigger acrosstheboard cuts if this congress exceeds these budget limits these cuts totaling more than 485 billion guarantee that we will reduce the deficit by a whopping 820 billion that is 150 billion more than president clinton and the democrat budget over there that is real deficit reduction and it is real tax fairness speaking of fairness remember as i said in the beginning this is your absolute last chance to remove the unjust energy tax and the grossly unjust social security tax off the backs of the american people who can least afford it members should not let their vote and i am talking about democrat members over there and their votes over here republicans be the one that saddles these taxes on the american people if they do they ought to be ashamed of themselves members should support this substitute because their constituents will thank them for doing it

country has heard about whitewater and they have heard about some of the mysterious things that have happened in the investigation into vince fosters death but there is a lot of other interesting things that have happened involving the rose law firm in little rock ar and hillary rodham clinton and the former governor of arkansas bill clinton tonight i would like to talk about two cases involving the failure of two savings and loans and the involvement of the rose law firm and some possible conflicts of interest that should be investigated by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation as well as the special counsel mr starr first american savings and loan of oak brook il was seized by the federal authorities for the federal government in 1986 first american savings and loan of oak brook was headed by former illinois gov dan walker dan lasater a friend of bill clinton had a brokerage business united capital corp and it traded treasury bond futures for first federal savings and loan of illinois and others dan lasater ran a brokerage firm in little rock ar he was a big contributor to bill clintons gubernatorial campaigns he was a friend of bill clinton and he flew clinton around in his private jet lasater gave roger clinton bill clintons brother a job and loaned him 8 000 to pay off a drug debt lasaters brokerage firm received a lucrative contract from the government of arkansas worth 750 000 to sell state bonds for a new arkansas state police communications network he also received millions of dollars in bonds for the arkansas development financial authority in 1986 lasater was convicted on drug charges this is bill clintons good friend he served only part of his sentence and he was pardoned after serving a small part of his sentence by then gov bill clinton in 1985 dan walker the former governor of illinois discovered that first american savings and loan was losing money big time on its treasury bond future trades with dan lasater according to court records mr walker lost approximately 361 000 walker claims that lasater made unauthorized trades with first federals money and walker told the chicago tribune they lasater co had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer at the time they made the trade and they did not do that walker sued lasater for 3 3 million for mail wire and securities fraud the suit charged that one of lasaters employees used first federals money to carry out what were in effect personal treasury bill trades does this sound familiar members heard me on the floor not long ago talking about a gentleman named dennis patrick from kentucky he had a similar story according to mr patrick in published accounts between 60 million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without mr patricks knowledge they traded 60 million to 107 million in bond trades in his account and he did not even know about it on 1 day 23 million was traded on his account without his knowledge now when federal regulators the fslic the federal savings and loan insurance corporation seized first american of illinois they continued to pursue the lawsuit against lasater they wanted to recover as much money as they possibly could dan walker the former governor of illinois was accused of lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured depositors money and later ended up being convicted of bank fraud and perjury hopkins sutter i know this is very complicated but hopkins sutter a chicago law firm was the primary contractor or law firm for the federal savings and loan insurance corporation hopkins sutter hired or subcontracted with a law firm in little rock ar called the rose law firm to handle the suit against lasater i hope everybody will think about this my colleagues lasater co mr lasater was a very close friend of bill clinton he flew around in his private jet they went on parties together lasater was convicted along with bill clintons brother of drug dealing lasater paid one of bill clintons brothers drug loans of 8 000 and after lasater was convicted he was pardoned by then gov bill cliiton rose law firm is hired as a subcontractor for the purpose of the suit against lasater they are going to go after lasater and hillary rodham clinton and vince foster were the two lawyers from the law firm the rose law firm to go after mr lasater think about that for a minute they are going after lasater for the federal government at the same time that he is a very good friend of gov bill clinton and has been pardoned for drug trafficking by the governor dan lasater was convicted of drug charges in 1986 as i said and served only a small part of his sentence and was later pardoned by the governor now president clinton now enter hillary rodham clinton rose law firms powerhouse lawyer and vince foster they handled the governments suit against lasater it is hard to believe this conflict of interest could occur but they are handling the case against lasater bill clintons friend because of the close ties between lasater and bill and hillary clinton she never should have been involved in this matter in any way that is a big conflict of interest in late 1987 a confidential settlement was reached between the government and lasater he ended up paying 200 000 of the 3 3 million suit that is all just 200 000 the chicago tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filings court records show that hillary rodham clinton and vince foster negotiated this settlement from 3 3 million down to 200 000 it started on may 8 1987 when hillary rodham clinton signed an amended complaint on this case that reduced the damages sought by the fslic against lasater from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million she negotiated the reduction of this down from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million for the fdic at a time when the guy lasater she was supposed to be nailing to the wall was a good friend of she and bill clinton the governor of arkansas the fdic said hillarys involvement tvas not extensive enough to constitute a conflict of interest this sounds like a whitewash by the fdic and to cover their tails the fdic said under federal rules existing at the time she did not have to inform the federal government about her close relationship with lasater and lasaters company the fdic said hillary worked only 3 houi s on the case they said she was not involved in the final decision to settle at 200 000 the fdic says vince foster did most of the work on this case he was her partner at rose the fslic that hired hillary and vince foster and the rose law firm could not remember details of the case the fdics earlier inquiry was primarily a review of court records and records submitted by the rose law firm the fdic did not interview i lary rodham clinton because of the apparent fdic wh wash in late february sena alfonse damato of new york questd the fdic acting chairm andrew hove to have the fdic insy tor general conduct a thorough rev of this matter and madison guarar hove asked the inspector general complete its investigation and relp to him in 90 days that was back february here we are in septem and the report has not yet come do now why

mistake about it i lary rodham clinton and bill clin had a very close relationship lasater and this was not made kn when hillary rodham clinton took that case in looking at the settlem he went on were they the rose law firm and hil rodham clinton looking after lasaters terests or the interests of the federal posit insurance corporation actually the federal savings loan insurance corporation scc told the chicago tribune that hill rodham clinton should not h worked on the case especially si the final settlement was confidentia william wernz a former chairmai the minnesota lawyers responsibi board for the minneapolis tribune s that the bar association model r define as conflict of interest instan where it is likely a lawyer might pull a punch because he or she some relationship with the other side some third party of interest law and accounting firms are usu barred from representing the federal c eminent in s l cases if they have per ally represented the s l or if they have sonal links to the persons targeted by lawsuit and that was specifically the case 4 lasater and company dan lasater a friend of bill clintons he conti uted generously to bill clintons c4 paign for governor he flew clin around in his private jet they had i ties together they went out toget all of the time dan lasater gave roger clinton a and loaned him a large sum of moi 1l to pay drug debts and after

milin lion down to 200 000 there was defiber nitely a conflict of interest that she wn did not let the american people know not or the fslic know about re here is a related problem home fedthe eral savings and loan of centralia il was was also seized by federal regulators and home federals former president king ir 8 betz sued lasater and company for d a 4 6 million for unauthorized trading has he chose the rose law firm to handle re his suit and hillary rodham clinton and was a big partner in that law firm and he chose the rose law firm to handle ant his suit because the issues involved iics were similar to the issues in first aw american hi after the federal government took over home federal the federal govter ernment continued the case and they 3ub had the rose law firm carrying the ney case for them op thomas mars represented lasater on om the other side of the table against the and home federal federal government suit so you had on one side of the table hil the rose law firm of which hillary ton rodham clinton was a partner like the ith case i just cited and on the other side wn was this guy named thomas mars on now where did he come from he had ent previously worked at the rose law firm so you have on one side of the lary table negotiating for the federal govin ernment the rose law firm and you de have a former lawyer in that same law firm representing lasater does that and sound like some conniving some pecur liar circumstances mars had preary viously worked at the rose law firm ave where he had worked on the american nce suit he worked on the first american 1 suit that i just talked about therei of fore he may have had some inside inlity formation on the governments case said since the case he worked on at the iles rose law firm was very similar ces king betz the man who started the case ip the first place for home federal has savings and loan was advised by or vince foster of the rose law firm to ally accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlekov ment in september of 1989 and he 3on agreed to the settlement but he did per not know that both sides of the table the were being worked by the rose law firm and a former lawyer who worked ith for the rose law firm wras king betz says that vince foster was rib handling his suit and never told him am about mars potential conflict of interton est or the clintons ties to lasater ar according to the chicago tribune her when betz was told that mars previously worked with foster and hillary job rodham in the first federal case for hey the rose law firm betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information but the cat was already out of the bag or in the bag because he had already signed off on the 250 000 settlement on a suit that was supposed to be for 4 6 million there are some questions that need to be answered by the rose law firm and by the fslic and the fdic concerning these two cases first when will the fdic inspector general issue its report on hillary rodham clinton first american and madison guaranty is this report being delayed until after the election it was ordered in february was supposed to be done in 90 days and here we are in september 7 weeks before the election and we still do not have the report why that needs to be done quickly r0 1800 now here are some questions that need to be answered by the fdic and the new independent counsel mr starr if he is investigating this and i think he probably will and in full and complete congressional investigations and hearings did hillary rodham clinton and or the rose law firm inform the federal government of her and her husbands ties to dan lasater i do not believe she did but we need to know if she did this is regarding the first american if they did not inform the government of their ties to dan lasater then why did they not because it was obviously conflict of interest to what extent was hillary rodham clinton involved in the suits they said it was only 2 or 3 hours but she signed or got the agreement to reduce the suit from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million so she was very conversant with it and very actively involved in it specifically what role did hillary rodham clinton have in the final decision tosettle the suit for 200 000 down from the 3 3 million if she was involved how were her actions affected by her ties to dan lasater and lasater co who was responsible for handling the case hillary rodham clinton vince foster or both obviously they were both partners in the rose law firm there had to be a conflict there who decided who would handle this case if vince foster was handling the case why was hillary rodham clinton involved at all we do know for sure the fdic has said that hillary rodham clinton signed the amended complaint reducing the damages sought from 3 3 million to 1 3 million now involving the home federal case why was not king betz the chairman there told about thomas mars conflict of interest he was a former lawyer with the rose law firm defending lasater why was not betz told about the ties between the clintons and lasater was the fdic informed about any of this did thomas mars the former errfployee of the rose law firm use inside information to arseptember20 1994 co range a 250 000 settlement on an over 4 million original suit these are questions that need to be answered the more we get into the machinations of the clintons the more we find all kinds of chicanery from whitewater to madison savings loan to these two savings and loan institutions in illinois to the angel fire development in new mexico there are so many questions that need to be answered that is why we need full and complete congressional hearings not just the facade we saw with the committee on banking finance and urban affairs in the house just a few months ago the people of this country have a right to know if there is corruption in this government they have a right to know if hillary rodham clinton had a conflict of interest when she was representing these individuals for the fdic i mean her husband was the governor he was a friend of the man that she was supposed to be nailing to the wall and she reduced the claim from 3 3 million down to 200 000 there are all kinds of questions that need to be answered and the only way the people of this country are going to know the facts is for us to have complete and thorough congressional hearings and they need to be held as quickly as possible i commend to my colleagues the following february 3 1994 chicago tribune article the special prosecutor appointed to scrutinize the business dealings of the president and first lady will focus on their role in an ozark land development called whitewater but there is another case buried deep in court records that could prove equally troubling to bill and hillary rodham clinton particularly if robert fiske the republican special prosecutor and former unitedstates attorney in new york makes good on his pledge to publish a report on the clintons political and business relationships when the president was governor of arkansas in the 1980s it involves a court case the first lady helped settie when she was a highpowered lawyer in little rock and the government was trying to sort out the problems of a bankrupt illinois savings and loan the illinois s l case suggests that hillary clinton as a private attorney had a glaring conflict of interest as an attorney for the federal deposit insurance corp she helped negotiate a secret outofcourt settlement that ended the governments suit against a family friend and an influential benefactor of her husband but the political problems the case could pose for the president and his wife may go far beyond the narrow questions about the first ladys conduct as a lawyer which she defends as in whitewater the illinois case places the president and his wife once again in an association with an unsavory wheelerdealer who had strong personal ties to the clintons and even stronger financial ties to the clinton administration in little rock in whitewater the trouble stems from the clintons business relationship with james mcdougal the guiding force behind madison guaranty an arkansas savings and loan that went broke and cost taxpayers more than 47 million fiske will examine whether clinton or his gubernatorial campaign benefited from mcdougals favorable treatment by a state agency in arkansas when clinton was governor in the illinois case the problem stems from the clintons friendship with dan lasater a convicted felon whose highflying bond tradingfirm played a hand in the troubles of several savings and loans including first american savings and loan association an oak brook institution headed by another politician dan walker who was governor of illinois from 1973 to 1977 it all started in 1979 in an unlikely venuethe oaklawn park racetrack in hot springs ark clintons mother the late virginia kelley had a passion for thoroughbred horseracing and her box at the track was next to lasaters an arkansas native who grew up in poverty in kokomo ind lasater started a hamburger chain when he was 19 and was wealthy by the time he met mrs kelley and clintons halfbrother roger at the racetrack in just over twb decades lasater had sold his first hamburger chain moved to arkansas founded the ponderosa steakhouse a nationwide chain of 650 family restaurants started a bond trading firm and nurtured his love for horseracing the racetrack friendship soon blossomed into an introduction to clinton who was trying to regain the governors mansion after losing an election in 1980 according to a clinton family friend by early 1983 lasater had given roger clinton a job at his florida horse farm clinton had reclaimed the governors mansion and lasaters bond firm had been added to a list of brokerage firms eligible to underwrite state bond issues a classification that generated millions of dollars in business for his firm according to published reports over the next two years the ties between lasater and the clintons grew stronger the clintons benefited from the relationship lasater contributed money to the governors campaign lent roger clinton 8 000 to pay off a drug debt sponsored fundraising parties at his offices made his private plane available to the ambitious young governor for campaign jaunts and encouraged his staff to donate to the governors campaign promising higher commissions to compensate for the donations according to published reports at one point in 1985 he also made his plane available to squire celebrities to a charity function organized by hillary rodham clinton lasater benefited from the closer ties too in the summer of 1985 clinton successfully lobbied the arkansas legislature to approve a contract for lasater to sell 30 2 million in bonds for the new state police radio system the contract netted lasaters firm 750 000 according to a report in the los angeles times meanwhile lasater spread his financial wings beyond arkansas signing deals to trade treasury bond futures with several savings and loans including walkers first american the s ls were trying to compensate for their moneylosing mortgage lending operations by engaging in the highrisk deals being peddled by lasater but things began to sour in late 1985 both in illinois and in arkansas at first american walker discovered that lasaters bond firm didnt have the magic touch according to court records walkers s l lost at least 361 572 in tbond futures trades made by lasaters firm they had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer each time they made a trade walker said in a telephone interview they did not do that meanwhile law enforcement officers in arkansas had started picking up reports that lasater had another problem he was distrib h9297 uting cocaine to friends and business associ ates at swank parties he threw in little rock and hot springs walker struck first filing a 1985 suit against lasaters bond firm alleging that the company committed mail wire and securities fraud by using first american funds for unauthorized tbond futures trades walker never got lasater in court first american was seized in 1986 by federal officials who later charged the former illinois governor with lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured deposits walker was eventually convicted of bank fraud and perjury federal officials also collared lasater they convicted him of cocaine possession and trafficking in 1986 meanwhile the federal regulators who seized first american decided to pursue the savings and loans 3 3 million suit against lasater to see if they could recoup some money for american taxpayers who funded the billiondollar bailout of hundreds of bankrupt savings and loans including first american the governments deposit insurance fund hired the rose law firm in little rock where hillary clinton was a powerhouse rose had successfully solicited the governments legal work on failed savings and loans in arkansas months earlier the lasater connection caused no end of problems for gov clinton during his reelection campaign in 1986 clinton came under attack from his republican opponent for steering state contracts to lasater while lasater was under investigation for drug trafficking clinton acknowledged being friends with lasater but denied knowing about lasaters drug activities clinton was reelected in 1987 lasater went off to serve his prison sentence after giving patsy thomasson another key clinton supporter and democratic party activist legal authority to manage his assets according to court records most of the rose firms s l legal work was andied by webster hubbel now the no 3 official at the unitedstates justice department but the firm assigned the governments suit against lasater to hillary clinton and vincent foster who later became deputy white house counsel for president clinton and who committed suicide last july in late 1987 court records show hillary clinton and foster negotiated a confidential settlement lasater paid the government 200 000 in return for the dismissal of its 3 3 million suit against him whether lasater got off cheaply at the expense of the american taxpayer depends upon his assets at the time and the strength of the evidence against him legal experts say nevertheless thomas scorza a former assistant unitedstates attorney who teaches legal ethics at the university of chicago law school said hillary clintons decision to represent the government in a lawsuit against lasater raises serious questions about her professional conduct a lawyer is required to represent the interest of their client zealously he said there is a substantial question about whether an attorney was representing a client zealously if the opponent of the client is someone with whom the attorney had a political financial and personal r~lationship in looking at the settlement were they the rose law firm looking after lasaters interests or the interests of the fdic scorza asked hillary clintons office declined to respond to specific questions about the case but issued a general statement defending her legal ethics our view is that hillary clinton when a lawyer at the rose law firm acted with the utmost integrity and professionallsm i have no reason to believe otherwise said her press secretary lisa caputo to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest scorza said hillary clinton should not have worked on the walker s l caseespecially because the final settlement was confidential the tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filing theres no evidence in the court case that the rose law firm or hillary clinton ever disclosed to their client the fdic the ties between tie clintons and lasater or thomasson who was representing lasaters interests at the time of the settlement thomasson who later became executive secretary of the arkansas democratic party is now director of the white house office of administration david barr an fdic spokesman said fdic attorneys are trying to locate records on first american to see if the rose law firm notified the fdic about any potential conflict of interest a law firm can be banned from receiving further work from the fdic and the resolution trust corp which disposes the assets of failed s ls if it misleads fdic officials about a possible conflict of interest barr said the first american case isnt the only problem for the firm which hillary clinton left before her husband assumed the presidency the fdic is trying to determine whether the rose firm misled federal regulators about a potential conflict of interest when the firm represented the deposit insurance fund against the accountants who worked for madison guaranty hillary clinton had represented madison the savings and loan at the heart of whitewater in addition fdic officials are looking into the case of home federal savings and loan of centralia another failed illinois institution which is very similar to the first american case it is not known whether hillary clinton was directly involved in the home federal case the rose law firm represented home federal in a 4 6 million suit against lasaters company for unauthorized trading but what is unusual about this case is that lasater too was represented by an attorney with ties to rose king betz former president of home federal said he initially hired the rose law firm because the claims in his suit were nearly identical to those in the first american case he said that vince foster was the lead attorney in the case and that he had no contact with hillary clinton after the government took over home federal it continued the case meanwhile though thomas mars a rose attorney who had worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first american suit against lasater left the rose firm months later he started representing lasater against home federal which was still represented by rose legal experts say the rose law firm should have notified betz and the fdic ab6ut mars potential conflict of interest because mars worked on the first american suit he could have had inside information that gave him an advantage in negotiating a settlement for lasater in the home federal suit betz says foster never told him about lasaters ties to the clintons he also failed to advise betz about mars potential conflict of interest betz said foster advised him to accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlement in we were told by the attorneys that we were not going to get any more money said betz who agreed to the settlement when told that mars had previously worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first federal case betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information mars denied any wrongdoing tnere was nothing funny going on everything was always on the up and up everything was

watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher tas and ~her spending will stifle growth in the private eoonomy kim jobs and not reduce the deficit the cinton plan is the 1990 budget deal pan ii in super 3d with twice the tax increase i urge my

age during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s it was an era in which i found my own courage to try and make a difference in this society i was inspired by individuals such as chavez i drew strength from his examples of leadership i am convinced that the lessons of the 1960s are still relevant today i am a product of that era i think that many of the difficult experiences that chavez and others went through should be discussed to remind people of the long struggle that was necessary to strengthen freedom and democracy in the postworldwar era i felt a great deal of kinship with cesar chavaz he like me started from very modest circumstances you see i come from a small southeast alabama town called troy in the 1940s and 1950s the signs of discrimination and segregation were everywhere i saw those signs that said white men colored men white women colored women white waiting colored waiting chavez experienced great hardships as a child growing up in migrant worker communities he suffered the harsh sting of discrimination and racism because his family traveled from one community to another in search of work chavez was not able to finish high school life was hard for the migrant farmworking families of the west it was especially hard for the mexican families who were subject to great discrimination despite the struggles of his youth chavez emerged as one of the most disciplined labor and civil rights leaders of his generation the grape boycott of 1965 that was led by chavez proved to be one of the finest hours of the migrant farmworker crusade it won the support of the nation and brought chavez into a highly visible position of leadership in the struggle for civil rights in the hispanic community chavez will be remembered for his courage and his

incremental reform will be back next year trying to convince the american people that we can do health reform without universal coverage well i am here to tell you that those people are wrong the reason incremental reform did not pass this year is because no one could figure out a way to do affordable insurance reform without universal coverage every proposal for insurance reform alone without universal coverage would have caused private health insurance premiums to increase the truth is thatu universal coverage is the foundation of affordable health care by the year 2000 health insurance premiums are expected to double and as premiums go up more and more people will lose coverage because their employerwonft beable to provide itand people simply will not be able to purchase it by themselves the inability of incremental reform to lve these problems is not going to change so we have to start over we have to return to the basics and do this tight in the next session of congress so lets returnto the basics when we started the reform process almost 2 years ago we shared a vislonof a health care system financed by everyone and covering everyone we had a vision of a health care system that was fair and ended the costshlfting that business and those with health insurance no longer can sustain we envisloned providing our people with health coverage so secure that they could devote themselves without distracttun to their families and itheir jobs we envisioned a health care system that would grow at a predictable rate so that the rest of our economy could flourish he question is has anything happened since we began his process to justify abandoning health reform goals of utniverallty affordability security and choice are more people insured today are more employers providing insurance are health care costs declining are citizens enjoying increased choice of providers and receiving better corntinuity of <are are administrative costs declining the resounding answer to these questions is no in fact more people have lost insurance since 1992 bringing the total of uninsured to almost 40 million more employers are dropping insurance and when people change jobs their new employers are less likely to provide com parable health benefits health care costs continue o rise assuring that health insurance will be unaffordable to americans who do not receive it through their employment those americans who do have insurance are increasingly unable to choose their doctors and hospitals involuntarily forced into managed care plans elected by their employers more americanslose their doctor every time their employers change plans a source of increasing anxiety and frustration this trend continues against the backdrop of soaring administrative cst within the insurance industry the nations largest managed care companies now devote nearly 30 percent of premium dollars to administrative overhead and profit the question is will incremental reform do anything to address these fundanental problems or will it make things worse having exarnned the existing proposals i have concluded that they not ony will make things much worsereducing coverage increasing costs further eroding choice for our citizensbut that in ftndamental ways they will set ba ck the course of health reform30 years i want to make clear why insurance reform as currently conceived will tepresent agiant step backward the element of incremental reform that has attracted a great deal of attention is the effort to make sure that people who have medical problems will not cottinue to be prevented from buying insurance the phrase used to describe this is limiting exclusions due to preexisting medical conditions the troblem is that this approach will only work if it is applied in a system in which there is universal coverage universal coverage is the foundation of successful health care reform we cannot construct any reasonable sheltsr unless it is bult on that foundation put another way universal coverage is the big tent with universal coverage everyone can fit into the tent people with preexisting conditions are in the tent and have health insurance coverage with universal coverage your health iiisurance moves with you when you change jobs so youstay in the tent with universal coverage you can get costcontainment and insurance premiums beoome more affordable because insured people are no longer paying for someone elses bad debt and everyone can stay in the tent but if you try to eliminate preexdsting condition exclusions without naivesal coverage insurance premiums will increase people with preexisting conditions may no longer be technically exclu dthey simply wil not be able to afford the price of the insurance policy without universal coverage there is no way to keep healthy peoplein the insurance 4system the tent gets rmnaler as a result when people with pre existing conditions finally buy insur ance and healthy people leave the insurance ipool the risk pools worsen premiums rise fewer individuals and employers can afford the price of buying health insurance and people ose coverage they have been forced out of the tent whatever we do in health care reform we must assure that health care becomes more affordable or it is inevitable that people will lose coverage only universal coverage makes insurance affordable without it we will never be able to spread the risk of ansurance to keep costs low and we will never be able to control costshifting the means by which the insured patlet pays for the debt of the uninsured patient and unless we stop cost shifting cost containment throughout the intire system is a pipe dream without universal coverage someone is uninsured and providing care to the uninsured is terribly expensive because they are simply too sick by the they seek care the uninsured patient is like the leak in the dike either you fix the dike or you face the flood and without september 29 1994 cc universal coverage the flood is uncontrollable health care costs the element of incremental reform that is supposed to at least get the nation on the road to universal coverage is the subsidy program that would give people vouchers to help them buy private insurance but the way the incremental proposals pay for those subsidiqs will cause many americans to lose coverage they already have how would these proposals pay for the subsidies to help peoplebuy insurance they would cut the medicare program our national health insurance program for senior citizens and the medicaid program our national state health insurance program primarily for mothers and children this is just robbing peter to pay paul except at the end of the day fewer people will have insurance coverage and the robbery will create great disription in our health care system assuming that you could overcome the enormous hurdle of administering voucher subsidies on an individual basis to well over 100 million americans a task that is completely unnecessary in a singlepayer systema subsidy program could work to expand coverage if the level of the subsidy were sufficient to assure that the voucher actually could pay for an adequate insurance policy and people knew they could count on the vouchers if they needed them none of the proposals for incremental reform designs a voucher system that will actually pay for insurance policies or be there when you need them they all tie the funds available for subsidies to deficit reduction resulting in an inadequate and unstable subsidy program the george washington university center for health policy research determined that under incremental subsidy proposals a family earning a total of 23 780 per year still would need to spend more than 16 percent of its gross income on health insurance the linkage between financing and subsidies in the incremental proposals are particularly destructive the incremental proposal in the house proposal terminates the medicaid program removing the guaranteed safety net of medical care in this country it is replaced only with a conditional subsidy program that will fluctuate from year to year people may be eligible in 1 year but not the next or may have a voucher that will actually purchase an adequate policyor may not literally millions of peoplemostly mothers and childrenwho have some protection now will be placed at risk because these proposals are more concerned with reducing the deficit than expanding coverage the subsidies are financed with cuts in the medicare and medicaid programs contrary to the widespread claims these cuts are not just reductions in payments to doctors and hospitals but include real cuts in services"], [7.021427563813631e-07, 7.021427563813631e-07, 0, "mir speaker there has been a

his death of files from his office and white house attempts to influence the resolution trust corporation investigation of mr and mrs clintons role in the arkansas s l but the investigation by the

investigator in this case tried to get mr nussbaum appointed assistant counsel during the irancontra investigation mr fiskes law firm represented the international paper co which got a 10 million loan from the arkansas development finance authority in arkansas his firm also represented the international paper co during the time when they sold hundreds of acres to the whitewater development corp mr fiske recommended louis freeh now head of the fbi to be the head of the fbi to mr nussbaum at the white house so there is some question about whether there will be complete thoroughness on the part of mr fiske and his staff in investigating the white house allegations but beyond that there is a lot of other things that need to be investigated because more and more is coming out daily first of all why did thengovernor bill clinton pardon a convicted cocaine dealer dan lasater in 1990 dan lasater pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in december 1988 but he served only 6 months of a 2 2year sentence while he was reportedly under investigation by the arkansas state police for drug dealing president clinton and the government of arkansas gave him 664 million in bonds to sell for the state which garnered him 1 6 million in commissions why did thengovernor bill clinton pardon copvcted cocaine dealer dan lasater in 1990 after all this involvement with him and they gave big contributions to clintons campaign he is thenpardoned for cocaine trafficking was it because dan lasater was a large contributor was it because dan lasater had flown the governor around arkansas and the country in his private jet was it because dan lasater gave roger clinton president clintons brother a job at his florida horse stables and loaned him 8 000 to pay back a drug debt did bill clinton know about the lasater investigation and lasaters drug use at the time he gave him 664 million in state bonds to sell according to published accounts and mr dennis patrick between wo million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without his knowledge that may have involved laundering of drug money one day 23 million was traded in his account patsy thomasson the chief personnel officer at the white house was running lasater co she was chief financial officer at the time now she is special assistant to the president of the united states where did this money come from where did it go did ms thomasson know about these transactions i do not know how she could not have there are of course other things that need to be explained in 1985 the arkansas development finance authority was created by bill clinton to provide economic development loans to small businesses in arkansas a number of serious questions have been raised about adfa which need to be investigated listen to this on december 29 1988 adfa deposited 50 million in a bank in the cayman islands why are you taking money out of the state of ar kansas and putting it in the cayman islands this money was transferred through simmons first national bank of pine bluff ar why did adfa deposit 50 million in an offshore bank instead of a bank in some other part of the country or in arkansas the interest rates were approximately the same the state departments international narcotics control report described the cayman islands as a haven for the laundering of drug money and here is the arkansas development finance authority sending 50 million down there was the 50 million plus interest repaid to adfa right now we do not have any documentation as to whether it was ever repaid we do not know what happened to it did the arkansas development fixiance authority make any other offshore deposits and for what reasons public documents show that adfa was steering millions of dollars in bond

defense dollars as president clinton said during his state of the union speech we must draw the line against further defense cuts though the fiscal atmosphere calls for tough decisions both the administration and the budget committee lave managed to retain a strong defense budget and stay within the discretionary spending caps taking an additional 2 4 billion out of defense would place our industrial base at risk and force the defense department to make cuts that would leave our military vulnerable the defense question would change from how do we best meetglobal and regional threats to which threats will go unmet as the representative of the aerospace center of california i know what is at risk and it is not pork the balance achieved in the committee budget resolution reflects the tough budget choices we made last year enacting the largest deficit reduction package in historynearly 500 billion over 5 years included in that package was a proposal i coauthored with several of my colleagues to create a deficit reduction trust fund to ensure that net revenue increases and spending reductions included in the package go toward deficit reductionnot new spending this discipline has paid off the deficit is lower than it has been at any point in the 1990s we have a growing economy a falling jobless rate historically low interest rates and negligible inflation our direction is sound and the committee budget resolution keeps us on this fiscal path and keeps federal spending within the caps that the congress enacted last year in contrast to maintaining the balance the solomon and kasich alternative budgets compromise the investments we need to secure a productive future the solomon proposal cuts the technology development associated with the space station it cuts wastewater treatment land conservation job training education and law enforcement the kasich proposal cuts energy research including renewable energy research it cuts environmental cleanup civilian technology research transit student loans and high speed rail development and these are cuts beyond the substantial scaleback of discretionary spending under which we are now operating that is not to say that additional balanced deficit reduction cannot still be achieved during the coming months many of us will be fighting for specific cuts during the appropriations process we need further tools to ensure that those cuts stick that is why i have joined with a bipartisan group of colleagues in drafting a deficit reduction lock box this lock box will mandate that cuts made in appr6priations

plan that fails to recognize the difference between small rural communities and large urban areas will serve no one particularly well whether you are from new york or punxsutawney pa when congress does finally vote on health care ieform legislation we must adopt a plan that provides flexibility for states and localities to meet their own special regional health care needs in particular congress must not forget that 27 percent of americans live in rural areas which have distinct health policy problems to resolve aside from the obvious geographic barriers to medical care such as rough terrain bad weather conditions and long distances between medical facilities rural communities must overcome certain demographic characteristics that make health care delivery a unique challenge rural populations tend to be older and poorer so there are higher concentrations of medicare medicaid and uninsured patients as a result rural hospitals and providers rely primarily on federal funds in the form of medicare reimbursement for survival as it is rural hospitals must contend with low occupancy rates and operate on shoestring budgets so the past decade of cuts and freezes in medicare reimbursement have put many rural hospitals in dangerous financial situations cutting the primary source of revenue for rural hospitals has forced many to close their doors altogether in addition to the financial problems of their local hospitals many rural areas suffer from an acute shortage of health care professionals primary care doctors physicians assistants nurses allied health professionals and other medical personnel are in short supply and most rural communities have a difficult time luring professionals from training sites in urban and suburban areas where they can make more money the maldistribution of health care professionals and the insolvency of our rural hospitals pose serious threats to the availability of medical care for rural americans regardless of whether they can afford it or not before we even try to control costs and increase access for the uninsured we must first revitalize the health care infrastructure in our medically underserved rural areas our efforts to reform the health care system will be pointless if rural citizens do not have a doctor to consult or a hospital to visit that is whywith the help of my health care advisory committee doctors nurses and other constituents concerned about health carei have drafted two bills to help solve the real health care problems confronting rural america the first bill i am introducing today is the rural health professional shortage act to improve the supply and distribution of medical professionals in rural areas the quality of rural health care is suffering because many young doctors nurses and other medical professionals elect not to practice in rural areas due to existing disincentives and drawbacks to practicing there while some decisions can be attributed to lifestyle preferences there are a number of other factors that influence where they choose to live and work for instance many young professionals are discouraged from practicing in rural areas because of lower earnings potential and lower medicare reimbursements for rural providers because rural professionals are often isolated from colleagues they cannot rely on them for consultation and second opinions they must work long hours many of which are on call often with little professional support most health care practitioners prefer working with the latest stateoftheart technology which many rural hospitals cannot afford also medical professionals tend to practice in areas close to where they were trained and most academic medical institutions and teaching hospitals are located in urban or suburban locales the rural health professional shortage act eliminates many of these financial and professional disincentives it provides urban and rural physicians equal medicare reimbursements for equal work by eliminating the urbanrural payment differential and it financially rewards those rural providers who have higher caseloads of medicare medicaid and uninsured patients my bill also encourages rural communities to grow their own health care professionals and targets scarce resources to individuals with rural backgrounds since they are most likely to return to and stay in rural areas finally the bill provides rural communities and their local hospitals the resources and technical assistance necessary to attract and retain medical professionals in their areas my second bill the rural hospital survival act recognizes the pivotal role hospitals play in the rural health care delivery system as the primary sources of medical care in rural areas and integral parts of local economies and it will help to keep many of our struggling critical access hospitals open according to the american hospital association 389 rural hospitals closed between 1980 and 1992 for those of us living in rural areas closure of a local hospital 6an significantly reduce our access to decent health care and cost the local economy valuable highskilled highwage jobs with fewer beds fewer admissions lower occupancy rates and higher perpatient perday expenses than metropolitan hospitals many small rural hospitals struggle to keep their doors open the office of technology assessment estimates that nearly onethird of all rural hospitals are operating in the red as i already mentioned rural hospitals rely primarily on medicare and medicaid payments and cuts in reimbursement rates have significantly increased the volume of uncompensated care provided by rural hospitals requiring them to provide more care with fewer dollars in addition to reimbursements that dont keep pace with health care costs rural hospitals must contend with an unfair medicare payment system that reimburses them less than urban hospitals the heart of the rural hospital survival act makes important adjustments to the medicare payment system including a complete elimination of payment differentials between urban and rural hospitals the bill establishes a new telemedicine grant program to promote the development of advanced data video and voice networks among hospitals and providers in rural regions it also renews two grant programs which have successfully helped hospitals and communities throughout the country improve health care delivery for rural residents antitrust exemptions would be provided to encourage cooperation and joint ventures among rural hospitals facilities would be able to share equipment services and health care personnel without fear of being sued and finally my bill would establish a commission to study the effects of state and federal regulations mandates and paperwork on small rural hospitals and the quality of care they provide rural americans have a great deal at stake in the health care debate not only will health care reformaffect the cost quality and accessibility of their medical care it will also impact the economic futures of their communities while working hard to promote job creation and economic development in my largely rural district over the years ive learned that the economic vitality of a rural community is closely tied to the quality and availability of medical care in the area local economic booms and busts closely correspond with the financial standing of the local hospital and the strength of a rural hospital can often serve as an accurate barometer of the state of the local economy as a local economy declines and unemployment rises the increasing burden of uncompensated care the local hospital provides fiscally strains the facility and affects the quality of care it provides often small rural hospitals cannot endure prolonged local recessions and when a hospital is forced to close it can devastate an already struggling local economy one reason is that hospitals are usually one of the largest employers in rural communities when a rural hospital closes the local area can lose dozens sometimes hundreds of well paying jobs also communities who have lost a hospital may have a difficult time attracting businesses and residents to their areas many companies are reluctant to relocate to a region that does not have a hospital or decent health care for a rural community to have a decent shot at attracting industry and creating jobs its local hospital must be in sound financial condition and its health care delivery system capable of providing quality medical care by strengthening the ailing health care delivery systems in our small rural communities my two bills will not only improve the health of our rural residents but also the health of our rural economies i urge my colleagues to

the arguments for and against the north american freetrade agreement i have talked at length with and listened to my constituents to three past presidents to president clinton and to many past and present cabinet officers to both our business community leaders and to our workers and i have listened attentively to our floor debate since the debate on this issue first began over a year ago i have openmindedly waited to hear and to understand any compelling arguments as to why this agreement truly benefits our nation our economy and our nations workers but the more i have heard the less i am convinced that this nafta is good for our nation with its high price tag nafta will cost our taxpayers billions of dollars it will throw our labor markets into turmoil and will cost thousands of american workers their jobs the joint congressional economic committee reported that nafta will cause a potential gross job dislocation of 500 000 or moreand downward pressure on unitedstates wages as well naftas environmental provisions are unwieldy unworkable and have been virtually closed to public participation it will place the health and safety standards of our states at risk because we will simply be unable to effectively enforce them equally important this agreement is not linked to any guarantee that mexican wages will rise as productivity increases in mexico nafta will force american workers to compete with mexican workers who make as little as 6 per day in some mexican export industries productivity is 80 to 90 percent of that in similar united states industries but wages are only 10 to 15 percent of united states wages naftas worker retraining program is not worth the name it proposes to spend the same limited amount of money to retrain hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the entire country as was spent to retrain the workers of only one automotive plant in new york moreover we must consider the threat of increased narcotics traffic crossing the mexican border without question the flow of illicit drugs into this country will increase as our borders are opened as transportation system are streamlined and as border inspections are reduced under nafta this administration was able to find a 17 million customs duties break for the honda motor corp as part of this bill but it could not find any new funding to deal with narcotics traffic that is sure to increase just as it erupted in europe when the european community opened its borders liberalizing trade is an important goal and we should support mexico in its economic reform efforts but in doing so this agreement must not neglect our nations interests and our interests are not well served by an administration which tries to buy a trade agreement at the expense of the taxpayer and the consumer with a number of sweetheart deals that amount to protectionism by any other name it is a sorry spectacle when the administration is willing to put us on the road to protectionism in the name of free trade yet this is precisely what is occurring when special protection is promised to our vegetable citrus sugarcane and beet growers the congressional budget office should be required to provide us with the cost to the treasury and to the consumer of these and any other special interest deals designed to win approval for this agreement it is my understanding that this legislation is trying to lower trade barriers at the same time it is laying the cornerstone of several new centers facilities banks and even bridges voters cynicism about washington only worsens as the mexican government and united states corporations pour millions of dollars into the lobbying campaign for this agreement a study conducted last may by the center for public integrity found that mexico was spending at least 30 million to sell this agreement to the united states congress since then millions more dollars have been pumped into this effort according to the center mexico has mounted the most expensive elaborate campaign ever conducted in the united states by a foreign government the mexican government has also helped to finance a private investment fund set up to buy american companies and move their work to mexico amerimex has tried to target some united states manufacturing firms by promising to replace our 10 an hour workers with 1 50 an hour mexican workers if nafta is adopted many american companies are going to have a hard time paying decent wages not to mention complying with environmental and safety standards in a poll conducted last year some 40 percent of 455 executives surveyed indicated they were likely to move some manufacturing to mexico after nafta is passed unlike the situation prevailing in the united states and in canada a governmentdominated alliance of business labor and farm organizations in mexico has broken the traditional tie between a workers wages and his productivity with the result that wages are artificially set and are thereby vrevented from responding to market forces nafta and the labor side agreement do not address this important problem nafta proponents argue that mexican wages have been rising over the past 2 years but these wages are still at about the same level as that prevailing in 1980 at present the average hourly wage in the united states is 16 17 per hour versus 2 35 an hour in mexico president salinas has promised to address this wage and productivity disparity but there are no guarantees that there will be a follow through on his commitment or that any successor mexican administration will choose to honor it in regard to the critical question of job creation there are no commitments about the agreements effects on our labor market only many confusing and contradictory studies the administration bases its claim that nafta will create some 200 000 jobs over the next 2 years based on the shortterm projections of the institute for international economics over a longterm scenario however this same institute projects a net job loss the economic strategy institute estimates that nafta will stimulate foreign investment in mexico especially in its exportoriented industries and that by the year 2002 as many as 220 000 jobs could move south a recent study by the joint economic committee concluded that the trade agreement could produce significant disruptions in the unitedstates labor market and the gross dislocation of 500 000 workers citing the 1993 trade statistics for mexico from the department of commerce the jec study concluded that our trade surplus and the related increase in united states employmentis fast disappearing together with the fact that mexico is likely to devalue its currency in the near futurewith or without a trade agreementthe administration claim of 200 000 new nafta jobs over the next 2 years appears to be completely unrealistic a study completed last month on the impact of the united statescanadian freetrade pact on canadas labor market concluded that the net employment effect has so far been slightly negative the migration of canadian jobs southward to the lower wage and less regulated workplace in our country should be a red flag for the implementation of nafta especially in light of the much greater difference in wages and working conditions prevailing between the united states and its neighbor to the south while many american workers will find their wages being held down or reduced by the agreement the american taxpayer will be asked to contribute billions of dollars for the agreement as well according to the joint economic committee report issued last week the total cost of nafta comes to 20 1 billion over the next 10 years this includes 8 8 billion in lost revenues resulting from tariff reductions 3 9 billion in proposed worker retraining which may be required and income support and 7 4 billion for the cost of the environmental cleanup and infrastructure development other estimates for naftas costs range from 13 billion to 54 billion depending on the estimates for the repair of large scale environmental problems along our border and for the comprehensive retraining and other support for labor force our society could be impacted with other costs as well many experts believe that the increased commercial border traffic resulting from nafta will lead to an increase in the flow of illicit drugs into the united states a september 1993 gao report on drug control efforts along the border indicated that the sheer volume of traffic makes effective interdiction an extremely difficult task about 8 million shipping containers enter the country in a single year and thousands of vehicles cross the bordef from mexico every day the drug problem lies in detecting which of these conveyances are transporting illegal drugs without impeding commerce according to the report an increased flow of commercial traffic under the proposed north american freetrade agreement can only be expected to exacerbate the problem one of the leading experts on the flow of illicit drugs into this country former unitedstates customs commissioner william von raab who served under president reagan has warned that nafta is likely to promote a quantum increase in drug availability here such an increase has taken place in europe when the border barriers were removed while the administration points to increased cooperative efforts of drug enforcement officials on both sides of the border there are no guarantees that mexico will continue its efforts if nafta is approved in advocating this agreement the administration also points to increased mexican cooperation in meeting the environmental pollution problems throughout that country and along the united statesmexican border the key environmental issue in regard to nafta however is the ability of the environmental side agreement to enable individuals or environmental organization to seek redress for any clear pattern of environmental abuses on this count the environmental side agreement is seriously deficient it fails to give these organizations or individuals access to the complaint and adjudication process the process itself is overly long and tortuous the agreement establishes a commission whose main function is the discussion and study of environment problems they are going to try to talk and study the problem to death and when more than talk is required its complicated and lengthy procedures requiring up to 470 days to completewill result in fines only after a countrys repeated failure to enforce its laws the ineffectiveness of the commission was described by top mexican trade negotiator jaime serra puche to the mexican congress on august 19 1993 in his remarks he noted the limited scope of the commissions powers and the timeconsuming process needed to reach enforcement recommendations he concluded that the long timeframe of the process makes itvery improbable that the fines or sanctions could ever be levied by any one of the governments against another in conclusion i believe that this agreement is deficient on too many counts accordingly i call on my colleagues to defeat this agreement before us

committee i have a commitment that this issue will be dealt with at the first appropriate opportunity the provision in question is section 13 of h r 3460 as reported by the public works and transportation committee this provision made a technical correction to section 131 s of the highway beautification act as added by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 that prohibits new billboards on scenic byways the purpose of the istea provision was to protect truly scenic areas all discussion of that provision related to scenic values and the understanding of the members during consideration of that provision was that it related solely to roads in scenic areas the federal highway administration interpreted that provision to override other provisions of the highway beautification act that permit the erection of billboards in commercial and industrial areas under the fhwa interpretation the new istea provision applies to commercial and industrial areas that may be designated as part of a scenic byway for the purposes of connecting scenic areas a state that has a scenic byway program will in most cases want to designate continuous scenic byway routes that is a scenic route that traverses mostly rural areas may pass through towns and cities the advantages of continuous scenic byways are numerous particularly conceming mapping and nolice to motorists what the fhwa interpretation means is that if a state designates a segment of road that runs through a commercial and industrial area as part of a scenic byway for the purpose of connectivity that segment of road would be subject to the new billboard prohibition no matter how urban or blighted that commercial or industrial area might be and even if the state does not want to change its billboard regulation in commercial and industrial areas the public works and transportation committee believes that the fhwa interpretation of section 131 s is not the best reading of the section the last sentence of section 131 s reads as follows control of any sign display or device on such a highway shall be in accordance with this section this section includes subsection d the commercial and industrial exemption the congress intended by this sentence that the scenic byway provisions would be subject to all the other provisions of the highway beautification act in addition if congress had intended to override other longstanding provisions of the act it would have explicitly done so a basic feature of the beautification act is to permit states to allow billboards to remain in industrial and commercial areas congress would not have relied on inference to make such a drastic change in the law indeed the conferees on istea never discussed the possibility of overtuming the commercial and industrial exemption the anomaly of the fhwa interpretation is that it preempts states in an area where they have never been preempted under the highway beautification act under the act a state may ban new billboards anywhere n the state including commercial and industrial zones the state may also choose to continue the federal commercial and industrial exemption the fhwa interpretation tells the state that if it designates a continuous scenic byway it may not as a matter of federal lawcontinue the commercial and industrial exemption even in the most blighted

other body that the fastest way to move the unemployment bill forward is to do it by approving the gentlemans motion and assure that the conference can come together very quickly"]], "top_unsure":

displayed in this body and with the current administration on issues relating to the economic independence of the former soviet union and the republics as greg mentioned about a year and a half ago we traveled together on a trip as part of the american delegation meeting with the council for security and cooperation in europe and attending the first human rights conference in moscow and part of our discussions during that trip related to the energy situation in the former soviet union and the inability of the soviet union to develop joint venture opportunities to allow them to take advantage of the energy resources that they have we met with individual american companies the mcdermott corp specifically and also marathon and we heard them tell us very emphatically that in the existing deposits that the soviets had identified at that point in time they were at best 25 percent efficient which meant that all across the 15 republics of what was the former soviet union they have the energy deposits and they are currently attempting to capture their energy resources but at best they are only 25 percent efficient meaning there is a terrible waste a terrible amount of damage to the environment and also an inability of the former soviet union and the republics to capture the kind of financial support that would allow them to achieve economic independence greg and i also in meeting with the officials of the former soviet union one of whom was general shaposhnekov who was at the time in charge of all military operations for the soviet union greo and i being members of the committee on armed services heard that as greg said they were faced with various options to bring in this hard currency to stabilize their economy two of those options of the three were not acceptable to us the one that greg mentioned was selling off the military hardware we know this has occurred we know the republics are looking at selling off tanks and ships and submarines and planes to other nations as we saw last year in a sale i believe it was a submarine to iraq to iran which greatly concerned our country and our military leaders that is not an option that we like in this country and one that we are very concerned about that is the selling off of their armament the second option is for the former republics to sell off their nuclear technology because we know they have vast reserves of nuclear energy and nuclear weapons that too is not an option that we feel comfortable with the third option the one that all of us agree is one that we should be exploring that does not involve taxpayers money does not involve a commitment of our resources is that of working with them to develop their energy resources and working with them to improve their production capability in the meeting that greg and i had with senator nunn he shared our concerns and in fact in his recent trip it was a focus of discussions he had with the leadership of the former soviet union boris yeltsin and that is that we work aggressively with them to allow them to achieve these joint venture opportunities with american energy corporations who want to help them gain longterm independence economically and develop these energy resources this also helps america reduce its dependence on middle eastern crude because we now have a new source of that energy that we so desperately need here in our country so with those things in mind greg and i decided it was time the congress focused on the assistance from a legislative standpoint to allow the republics of the former soviet union to gain this independence economically and develop these energy resources this caucus that we formed has now grown to include almost 40 members from both parties we played an active and instrumental role in getting the russian aid package to include a section on energy and ways that we could support the energy project that we have talked about and we have testified before the trade commission very specifically detailing changes that we should be pushing in our administration and changes that the russian and other republics have to push in their legislatures to allow enterprises in the former soviet republics and with american corporations to come together to help establish these joint ventures we are at a critical time period right now because there have been 3 major projects proposed in terms of energy two of these projects unfortunately have not succeeded the most recent one the white knights project which greg and i have both attempted to work on there is a major project right now that is under consideration at sakhaline on the far eastern borders of russia that we are aggressively trying to put forth and i am going to ask my colleague in a moment to talk about a meeting he had just this past week with president clinton where he was talking about the specifics of how we can help the sakhaline project but we also realize that there are opportunities in baku and azerbaijan and my colleague the gentleman from texas led a delegation to azerbaijan just a few short weeks ago where he met with the legislature in that republic where he had a facetoface meeting with energy officials where he talked about our concerns in working with the azeris and finding a way that we could work together in developing some other energy resources we have a lot of opportunity here it is an area we can help the russian republics very quickly without massive amounts of hard dollars and tax dollars from the american public it is in both of our interests to move quickly to establish legislative initiatives both in the former soviet republics and in our country in this countrys congress to tear down the barriers that exist largely in the bureaucracy as a matter of fact one of the initiatives of the caucus that greg and i have worked on is establishing a legislative caucus inside of russia and the other republics that can work handinhand with our caucus so that we can have an ongoing dialog with the legislature in both countries to work to break down some of these barriers that have existed in terms of not allowing our energy corporations to do these joint venture projects i am happy to be a part of this special order and this colloquy and again where it not for the leadership of my friend who is from an energyproducing state a lot of this would not have taken place i was not privileged to attend the meeting at the white house but perhaps he would like to give us an update of what occurred a that meeting"], [4.458427429199219e-05, 0.499955415725708, 1, "the

add from both ends ofthe spectrum because we wanted to get a full picture of what it was that we needed to do to make the economy grow we asked what is the single most important thing we can do to produce the right action for economic growth in our country and the broad consensus was the single most important thing that we can do along with regulatory reform and along with marginal tax rates was the change in the capital gains tax rate and we wanted to be very careful of that so we got to bill archer who is the ranking republican on the ways and means committee and we said how do we do this to be fair to everybody how do we do this so that we do not face the argument of trying to do favors for business people often times who are viewed as particularly by the other party as being rich people how do we get away from doing the rich people in this country a big favor so this bill is structured by bill archer in such a way that people who are in the lower brackets get a more significant break than people who are in the higher brackets even on a capital gains tax rate as well as of course the indexing so on that one item we expect very important big things to happen you mentioned the neutral cost recovery which is a fancy word for saying giving people a good break on how to depreciate equipment they buy for their businesses and while these are not common everyday things that we talk about around the dinner table at night at least not most of us we know from our experience in having watched what happened to changes in the tax code that took place in 1986 1990
