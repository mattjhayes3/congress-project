billion dollars out of this budget now when you look and you compare what we have to pay in interest on the debt compared to what we are paying for education or homeland security or veterans it is totally and utterly disproportionate to the kind of investments we need to be making because this money and on the chart here we are borrowing this money from the japanese government we are borrowing the money from the chinese government we are borrowing the money from opec countries we are ceding our country away to these other foreign interests and at the same time we are asking japan and cliina to borrow money because we do not have enough because we are giving out corporate subsidies to the oil companies and corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies while we are doing that we have to go and borrow the money from the chinese government and then we have to borrow it from the opec countries and as we showed before earlier an hour or so ago the chinese government is taking this money they are lending it to us collecting the interest and investing that money in the training of engineers to the tune of 600 000 engineers that they are going to train next year while we are training 70 that really is the bottom line that these kind of decisions are leading and costing they are leading to enormous problems for our country and they are costing us a lot of money they are

the energy companies profits going up subsidizing them too pharmaceutical companies profits through the roof subsidize them too this is paytoplay in washington d c and all the while it is happening at

a whopping 8 18 trillion i used the occasion to contrast the fiscal policies of the clinton administration namely turning the largest budget deficits in history to the largest budget surpluses in history with the fiscal policies of the current administration however my protestations and the warnings of my fellow blue dog democrats continued to fall on deaf ears it is inconceivable that deficits soaring as far as the eye can see mounting debt and the skyrocketing costs of military operations in iraq and afghanistan would be ignored for so long and that it would take a tragedy such as hurricane katrina to finally serve as a wakeup call for years members of the blue dog coalition have warned that we were spending money we did not have that the administration had no economic plan and that massive untargeted tax cutswere not a substitute for an economic blueprint for our countrys future and yet the congress continued to reject every proposal requiring us to do our budget in the same way that our constituents do by paying as we go now that hurricanes katrina and rita have wreaked havoc on the gulf coast causing hundreds of billions of dollars of damage it is clear that we must take immediate action to get our fiscal house in order members on the other side of the aisle have finally acknowledged what democrats have been saying for years that our current economic policies cannot be maintained unfortunately however some in the majority party have proposed that we ask those americans who have been impacted most by katrina namely the elderly and those with low incomes to bear the costs this is not the answer to the persistent poverty exposed so brutally and graphically by katrina we must pursue a comprehensive solution to our fiscal woes by suspending tax cuts for wealthy families by cutting spending and enacting paygo rules payasyougo and establishing an emergency rainy day fund the 2005 budget resolution included 106 billion in new deficit finance tax cuts over the next 5 years these additional tax cuts will impose a huge additional debt burden on the next generation if the government is forced to borrow the money to cover these added expenses the yearly interest payments alone will pile on the already enormous debt that our children and grandchildren will be faced with paying off most of these tax cuts will actually be doled out to individuals who do not need more of the governments largesse with american troops in combat in iraq and afghanistan and with our country coping with the rebuilding of the gulf coast all of us all of us must sacrifice for our troops and for our neighbors in addition to suspending tax cuts for wealthy families the congress must immediately restrain its voracious appetite for spending finding places where cuts can be made to pay the costs of katrina and iraq and in addition to making tough cuts the congress should move to immediately reinstate paygo rules to stop any further bleeding finally the congress must establish a rainy day fund for future katrinas so we will not find ourselves in this spot again the interest earned by such a fund could be used for disaster planning and preparedness to modernize our nations infrastructure fortify our levees and to update and makeinteroperable our communications systems the american people now understand the precarious state of the nations finances

parents taught me and what most of our parents taught all of us that is we leave the country a little better off than we found it in 1989 a new york city real estate developer named seymour durst placed a large national debt clock in times square in order to draw public attention to what he saw as a grim predictor of financial instability for 11 years the debt numbers on the clock rose at the breakneck pace of 13 000 a second in 1995 as the clinton administration began to pay down the national debt onlookers were shocked to see the numbers on that clock not only slow down but reverse the

in a dispute over how to pay for hurricane katrina the cost of which could fall between 100 and 200 billion maybe even more for the federal government alone some for the most part their most conservative members have proposed big cuts in programs that range from student loans to medicaid to food stamps about 50 billion in spending cuts spread over 5 years they present these spending cuts as a way to offset partially at least offset the spending increases that the response to katrina andrita are going to require but in actuality these spending cuts will not go to offset katrina because the republican budget the budget resolution operative for the year 2006 the resolution to be brought to the floor to be amended already calls for 106 billi6n in additional tax cuts 106 billion in new tax cuts and when these new tax cuts are passed the spending cuts proposed ostensibly to offset the cost of katrina will instead go to make up for the loss of revenues due to the 106 billion in tax cuts since the spending cuts are 50 billion and the tax cuts are 106 billion none of the spending cuts will ever make it to the bottom line where they might otherwise be available to offset the cost of katrina so the first problem that we as democrats have with what our republican colleagues are pushing is that it is not what it purports t6 be it is not a plan to pay for katrina it is a plan to facilitate 106 billion in additional tax cuts the second problem that we as democrats have with their plan is that we believe the cost of helping one state sustain the catastrophic loss and cost of a natural disaster a disaster like katrina hurricane rita should be borne by all of us by all of the states should be a matter of shared sacrifice has been in the past should be in future it works and it is right but we do not believe that those least able to bear the costs should be saddled with the lions share of the load and yet that is exactly what their plan will do because they are pushing a plan that will pay fof the cost of katrina by coming down hard and heavy on the backs of students borrowing to pay for their college education on the sick whose only access to care is through medicaid and on the very poor who depend upon food stamps to feed their families this is just some of those on whom the cuts they are proposing will fall and the reason we are proposing alternatives and opposing the plan that they are bringing to the house floor what we have coming before the house is a plan for spending cuts that basically and simply does not achieve its stated purpose because it does not go to cover the cost of hurripane katrina and the spending cuts it does select whether they are used to offset tax cuts or offset the costs of katrina as i have said come down on some of these who are the least able to sustain and bear them it is fair to ask i think as we begin to consider such a program why is it we are insisting upon offsets for rebuilding biloxi or bay st louis or new orleans but not insisting on offsets to pay for rebuilding baghdad or mosul or basra well one of the reasons i believe that we are experiencing this newfound interest in offsets that might diminish the deficit is that the evidence of a swellink deficit that is not going away it is a structural deficit built into the budget not a cyclical deficit deficit based on the ups and downs of the economy one that is going to be with us for a long time to come because of fiscal decisions that were made in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 is becoming so obvious so widespread so obvious so significant that it simply cannot be denied i mean after all the basics are apparent and they are well known as yogi berra used to love to say you can look it up it is a matter of record back in the year 2000 we had a surplus of 236 billion matter of record the budget was in the black by 236 billion unprecedented that was a budget that was inherited by mr bush today just a few weeks ago as a matter of fact the administration closed the books on fiscal year 2005 and when they closed the books they finally declared the balance at 320 billion and they took some credit because that deficit is actually smaller than the deficit in 2004 which was 412 billion but a 320 billion deficit is nothing to crow about look at what has happened over the last four fiscal years the simplest way to show it to you on the back of an envelope is to look at how many times our republican colleagues have had t vote to increase the debt ceiling of the united states and what those total increases come to since 200t this chart shows it to you very very clearly it shows that in june of 2002 despite the administrations assurance that we would not have tn increase the debt ceiling the legal limit to which the united states can borrow for another 8 years they were back a year later saying we need an increase this year of 450 billion then in may of 2003 they came back and asked for an incredible amount 984 billion you would think that big an increase would take you at least several years this request was approved on may 26 2003 by the summer of 2004 the bush administration was back secretary snow came back hat in hand saying we have just about run through the 984 billion increase you allowed us last year we need another 800 billion increase and before we could leave for the winter break last november that had to be passed finally this year we had a budget resolution on the house floor passed the senate has now been passed as a concurrent budget resolution it calls for an increase of 781 billion in the year 2006 if you add all of these debt ceiling increases together you will see that to accommodate to make room for the budgets of the bush administration over the last four fiscal years we have had to raise the debt ceiling of the united states by 3 trillion 15 billion so why do we have this newfound interest in offsets it is because the budget is becoming undeniably unsustainable i yield to the

this budget proposal will have on the lives of working american families this year thanks to president bushs taxcutting progtam the unitedstates government will deliver up to 106 billion to the multiple bank accounts of some of the wealthiest americans this government program to help wealthy americans spend more money now forces a false crunch on our resources a 50 billion cut that

of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are

rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it

opportunity to educate the public and the administration and of course congress with regard to the most pressing issues confronting our country as itrelates to this budget especially as it relates to those who have not benefited from the huge tax cuts few traditions are more significant in our democracy than the presidents annual submission of the budget it provides us really a window on the pres dents and the administrations values and their priorities for this term it also sets the tone and the standard for us in congress by marking the spending levels for this year now i quite frankly had to go back and reread the presidents state of the union speech because i wanted to see how consistent this budget was in terms of what he presented to the country in his state of the union address so i would like to mention a couple of those points tonight first of all of course in his state of the union message he said that one of the deepest values of our country is compassion i think we have heard that tonight this presidents 2006 budget shows very little compassion instead of sending us a budget for the american people for the people this president has sent us a budget that really turns our back on the people and on their future it sacrifices our children our seniors our security our veterans our environment and our economy in order to advance special interests and to make permanent tax cuts for the wealthy in his state of the union speech the president also said over the next several months on issue after issue let us do what americans have always done and builda better world for our children and our grandchildren well let me tell my colleagues how does cutting 5 billion in housing how does eliminating funding for hope vi how does cutting funding by 50 percent for the disabled in terms of housing how does this create a better world for our children and for our grandchildren the assault on the poor in this budget is appalling and the cuts keep coming the presidents budget has cut community development block grants has cut housing assistance for people living with hiv and aids it has cut the lead paint abatement program it cuts the fair housing program it cuts rural housing initiatives it cuts native american housing it cuts the youth build program it has eliminated the empowerment zone and brownfield programs and this is just the tip of the iceberg again going back to the presidents state of the union speech how does this budget build a better world for our children and for our grandchildren also in his state of the union speech the president acknowledged rightfully so the devastatingly high rates of hiv and aids in the african american community and we acknowledge the presidents leadership in calling on congress to reauthorize the ryan white care act during last weeks state of the union speech the president indicated this but again i must say looking at this budget it offers very little for our minority aids initiative he proposes a 10 million increase in the ryan white care act 10 million this is far short of what is needed we need at least 513 million more this year to keep people off of waiting lists and to prevent new infections in short we need a budget that provides a minimum of about 2 6 billion if we are really serious about addressing this hiv and aids crisis here in america a 10 million increase in the ryan white care act really does not signal the seriousness of this crisis furthermore we need more money for the minority aids initiative ever since this president has been in office we have flatfunded the minority aids initiative at 407 million we need at least 610 million this year if the president is really serious again as he said in his state of the union address if he is serious about addressing the hiv aids pandemic in our communitids the budget does not reflect what the president has said in terms of the seriousness of this in our country also in the state of the union the president devoted a large portion of his speech to address social security and as he described it social security is one of americas most important institutions a symbol of trust he said between the generations and that it is headed towards bankruptcy well even if we discount the fact that the president simply is incorrect and i believe he is and many of us do in his assessment about social securitys solvency his budget for 2006 does not even include the cost of his estimated 1 3 trillion proposal for social security privatization over the decade after its enactment this is a critical omission and the president said in his state of the union speech that a taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely or not at all well let me just say parenthetically i believe not only should tax dollars be spent wisely but they should be spent with compassion as he talked about earlier not or not at all but in this budget these cuts that the president has proposed are not even wise let alone compassionate also the presidents state of the union speech was about freedom and democracy very grandiose statements he made but i wondered when i was listening to him why justice as a value why this was omitted really from these grand statements in the state of the union well quite frankly after reading and reviewing this budget i can see why it explains why because there is no justice in this budget so i think we need to go back to the drawing board and we need to remind the president about his state of the union message and i would say as many have said before that we want not just a budget but a just

our national debt just went to 8 trillion the republicans have controlled this house since 1994 they have had the white house since 2000 and the senate on and off but it had control of the senate for the past few years they have been able to implement their agenda and they keep saying that we want to raise taxes we do not want to raise taxes we want to reduce spending here as the rhetoric came from the other side but we do not want to do it on the backs of the middle class we want to reduce corporate welfare to the tune of 16 billion in the two energy bills sixteen billion dollars we voted to subsidize oil companies and they are coming out with the highest profits that they have had in a long long time record profits just in the last quarter we want to end corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies 700 billion in spending on a medicare prescription drug bill that does nothing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs democrats wanted reimportation from canada to help reduce the cost democrats wanted to give the secretary of health and human services the ability to negotiate down drug prices by basically going on behalf of all of the medicare recipients to merck and pfizer and all of these big drug companies and basically say if you want a contract let us talk price if we took 10 or 20 percent of the savings of that bill 700 billion over the next 10 years if we saved 10 percent that is 70 billion which would pay for hurricane katrina but we could save closer to 20 or 30 percent which would be 140 billion of the taxpayers money that we could save we do not want to raise taxes now do we think that we should be giving tax cuts to bill gates and warren buffett and at the same time cut medicaid which is a health care program for poor kids and poor families meanwhile middleclass americas health care is going up 1520 percent my god we cannot do anything to help average people because we have to take care of the big corporations and keep the corporate welfare going let me say this before we get back to our message this is very simple to connect the dots this body taxes the american people the american people send their money down here the republican congress gives that money to the tune of 16 billion in the last few months to the energy companies can you imagine your tax dollars going to subsidize oil companies american tax dollars coming down here and the republican majority takes it and gives it to the pharmaceutical companies to buy prescription drugs for seniors great idea but is it a good policy not to do anything about controlling the costs what the republican majority does is then they go to the shakedown street which is k street where all of the lobbyists are they go and shake down all the lobbyists who they just spent a bunch of tax dollars on and the lobbyists who they shake down fill up the republican campaign committee coffers to the tune of millions and millions and millions of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars is spent lobbying this is corrupt to the core this is not the way to govern we understand there is money in politics but to use the hardworking publics money that average people send down here and to give it to corporations is atrocious our good friend cal thomas who is one of the most conservative republican columnists in the country said in the washington times which is not a liberal newspaper gives his friends in the majority a little suggestion do not start with the poor to pay for hurricane katrina start with the rich he goes on to say which i tend to forget about the corporate subsidies to the big agribusinesses this is cal thomas not the gentlewoman from florida or me this is our conservative republican friend cal thomas 72 percent of farm subsidy money goes to 10 percent of the recipients the richest farmers corporations estates and other entities this is ridiculous that we are going to cut lunch programs food stamps cut student loans for average people

or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and it will not be like it is now and it will not be business as usual and it will not be well i dont care if you do not

because of unconstitutional gun control amendments added tothe bill in the senate as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i cannot support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans i believe that the second amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majority in the senate i regret that under the guise of helping gun owners

around the coastline of our country he particularly focuses on natural gas and professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300

when congress and president nixon joined forces to fight the battle against cancer in 1971 cancer was largely a death sentence thirty five years later our national research investment has yielded

the national flood insurance program is a valuable tool in addressing the losses incurred throughout this country due to floods it assures that businesses and families have access to affordable flood insurance that would not be availableon the open market prior to the passage of the national flood insurance act in 1968 insurance companies generally did not offer coverage for flood disaster because of the high risk involved today more than 20 000 communities participate in the national flood insurance program more than 90 insurance companies sell and service flood service insurance there are more than four million policies covering the total of 800 billion the national flood insurance program provides federal flood insurance for properties located in floodprone areas where the community has voluntarily agreed to institute floodplain management and land use control measures that minimize the risk of flooding and mitigate potential flood damage the program is intended to provide a more costefficient alternative to costly federal disaster assistance by encouraging communities to take preventive measures to reduce flood losses and providing affordable flood insurance that would not otherwise be commercially available last years hurricane season resulted in significant strains on the nfip the claims resulting from the losses from these catastrophic hurricanes is unprecedented in the history of the program since the nfips inception in 1968 the program paid out 15 billion in claims in contrast claims for hurricanes katrina and rita alone are expected to exceed 25 billion this far surpasses claims paid by the entire history of the nfip in the past when losses exceeded premiums the nfip had been allowed to borrow from the unitedstates treasury to repay claims such loans have

proposals and for the best of reasons they said we should look at a 100year traditional floodplain and anybody within a 100year traditional floodplain should be required to pay for insurance the problem that unany of us have who represent districts who have mitigated 100year floodplains is that all of our people who are not at risk would be required to basically boost the program by increased premiums by them participating in it also and when federal dollars state and local have been spent to mitigate 100year floodplains many of us thought that that was unreasonable in fact the 100year floodplain would have impacted a large portion of l a county that i represent anything near the l a river would have been included and most of orange county would also because the prado dam mitigates that there was another proposal made with the best of heart and the best of concern for the people of this country that said lets look at a historical 500year floodplain the problem we had with that is there is no evidence available and then there is no information available either that we can dictate and determine how much a 500year floodplain might be if we had taken a 500year historical floodplain it would have included all of l a most of l a county and most of orange county and any other city in this country that is next to a river or near the coast i offered an amendment and it was supported by the committee that said lets do a gao study to determine if we need to expand the program how it should be done how it should be implemented i think it is a reasonable approach rather than us just making a kneejerk reaction to a severe problem and it is a problem we have to address i am not saying we dont but to tax people who are not impacted or not at risk of flood to boost the program i think is unreasonable it would have impacted many of our districts that dont live in areas of high risk and i do understand the need that we need to protect those who are within thb program we need to make the program actuarially sound and i am pleased with the language in this bill that is included here and it expands the coverage of the program and i urge my colleagues to reject any amendment that would further expand it without gao studies"], [0.999723751534475, 0.0002762484655249864, 1, "on september 14 2006 i was unavoidably detained and missed rollcall votes 442 and 443

move in on something go ahead and i will let you interrupt and you can let me interrupt and we will go like that lets talk about tax policy in the united states congress since i have been here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"], [0.9996832609176636, 0.9996832609176636, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise today in support of h con res 357 which supports the goals and ideals of national cystic fibrosis awareness month beginning in may every year in the united states about 1 000 children are born with cystic fibrosis or cf a lifeshortening genetic disease according to the cystic fibrosis foundation those children face a median life expectancy of 36 years an average that fortunately has continued to increase as science and research have developed better treatment and drugs and while a median life expectancy of 36 is unacceptably low that figure is cause for hope for those living with the disease and of course their families they know that in 1955 the year parents of children suffering from this disease formed the cystic fibrosis foundation children born with cf usually did not live to attend preschool as the life expectancy increases those suffering with this disease and their families continue to work for a cure or a lifeextending treatment while a cure for cystic fibrosis remains illusive the symptoms and effects of the disease are fairly simple cf is one of the most common lifethreatening genetic diseases in the united states more than 30 000 people in the united states have cf and over half of them are children in addition over 10 million americans are unknowing symptomfree carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene cystic fibrosis affects the lungs and digestive system e 1500 the defective gene that causes cf triggers the production of abnormally thick mucus in the lungs that leads to restricted breathing recurring lung infections and in many cases digestive problems the infections deteriorate the lungs and their capacity to deliver oxygen to the body a condition that worsens over time and in many cases even leads to death or the need for a lung transplant one of the goals of h con res 357 is to promote the need for early diagnosis and the importance of newborn screening so that treatment of children with cf can begin as soon as possible to improve their health and longevity the five decades that have passed since the founding of the cystic fibrosis foundation have brought not only hope but years to the lives of those suffering from cf the cystic fibrosis foundation continues to be at the forefront of making more with less in the area of drug discovery and development the therapeutics development program tdp created and launched by the cf foundation has pioneered new ways to conduct cuttingedge lifesaving research in a costeffective and efficient manner this program now includes 18 major research institutions across the country in an established clinical trials network the tdp provides innovative companies with funding raised through private donations to the cf foundation to undertake research and development on promising new drug candidates and supports an extensive pipeline of potential new therapies in fact the cf foundation currently has more than 30 drugs and therapies in various stages of clinical trials any one of which could dramatically improve the life of someone suffering from cf i believe that the innovative programs like the therapeutics development program are part of the blueprint for more efficient and costeffective health care and should be supported so as you can see cf foundationsponsored research is adding precious years to the lives of those living with the disease so that they might live long enough to benefit once a cure is found today there is more potential research on new drugs and therapies than funds to finance that lifesaving work this is a problem created by a wealth of scientific riches and one that i hope can be bridged by more publicprivate partnerships which leverage our worldclass biotech and pharmaceutical companies with the capabilities of institutions like the national institutes of health to ensure that the discovery phase of identifying new drugs and compounds to treat cystic fibrosis continues to that end the resolution before us today advocates strong partnerships between government resources like the nih and nonprofits like the cystic fibrosis foundation as a key means to improve care for those with orphan diseases like cf in closing i would like to commend my friend and colleague mr markey from massachusetts for itis leadership and work supporting this resolution and for our partnership

known as katie to her family and friends was a vibrant loving communityoriented high school junior who dreamed of a career in fashion or interior design she encouraged other young women through her participation in the ophelia project a nonprofit group dedicated to encouraging middle and high school girls to believe that an individuals true beauty comes from within as a junior at durant high school in valrico florida katie planned to take the sats in april and spend her summer examining colleges her commitment to academic achievement and hard work guaranteed that she would succeed in whatever field she chose katies entire future was ahead of her and what a bright one it would have been but it was not to be on march 3 2006 katie was involved in a car accident that ended up claiming her life early the following morning to the devastation of her loving parents vincent and laura and her younger brother andrew she was not wearing her seatbelt had she buckled up march 4 may have been one day closer to realizing her dreams instead it was the day when they were ended unfortunately katies decision to forego wearing a seatbelt is not uncommon among the entire population teenagers are the most likely to neglect this importanf lifesaving measure a study conducted by the national highway traffic safety administration in 2002 indicated that only 69 percent of 16 to 24yearolds use seatbelts compared to 82 percent of children and 76 percent of adults among 16 to 19yearolds the statistics are more troubling only 40 percent use seatbelts consistently and the fatality analysis reporting system shows that 63 percent of teens killed in crashes were not wearing seatbelts data also reveals insights into why teens neglect to fasten up when they get in a vehicle according to a 2003 survey only 79 percent of teen drivers reported that they wear a seatbelt all the time about 47 percent indicated that safety belts were as likely to harm as to help and 30 percent said that crashes close to home were usually not as serious approximately 30 percent affirmed that they would feel selfconscious if they were going against the group norm in wearing safety belts these statistics are troubling seatbelt use has proven effective time and again in saving lives according to nhtsa the wearing of safety belts saved an estimated 14 164 lives in 2002 choosing to buckle up is the best protection against drunk tired or aggressive drivers and yet people choose not to take this precaution what can be done to encourage them to do so studies have shown that highly publicized and visible enforcement of safety belt laws have increased seatbelt use peerled education and awareness also hold promise in changing youth norms and attitudes about seatbelt use parental involvement is absolutely critical children who observe their parents using seatbelts and obeying traffic laws are more likely to adopt these lifesaving habits vincent and laura marchetti imparted this wisdom to their daughter and even prevented her from getting her license until she was 6 months beyond her 16th birthday they instilled a sense of responsibility in her and practiced driving under all sorts of conditions but it was not enough technological advances have proven to be one of the most promising catalysts for increased seatbelt use a study commissioned by nhtsa found that while enhanced safety belt reminders such as buzzers lights and dashboard messages are aimed at the general population they may be particularly effective for teenagers because teens tend to forget to fasten their seatbelts and are less likely than adults to disengage warning systems they may be more likely to be persuaded to buckle up by these annoyances i encourage the automobile industry to help address this problem by increasing and expanding the manufacture of vehicles with warningsystems that do not disengage until the seatbelt is fastened these systems may save precious young lives i didnt know katie
