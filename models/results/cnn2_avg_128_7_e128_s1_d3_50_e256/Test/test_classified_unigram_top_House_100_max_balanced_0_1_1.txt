thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would otherwise have known without the opportunity and privilege of calling sala burton a very close and special friend"], [0.00012350082397460938, 0.9998764991760254, 1, "i rise today in response to the unrelenting assault on amercas elderly and poor that assault is most clearly and most recently reflected in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding americas most vulnerable"], [0.00015279017679858953,

all of our friends on the left who were eager to come down here and explain what is wrong with the government of el salvadoe or eager to explain what is wrong with the freedom fighters in nicaragua suddenly cannot find any spare time to talk about what the communist dictatorship in nicaragua is doing i can appreciate the difficulty that our friends on the left have because the dictatorship in nicaragua is posing a problem about reality the reality that secret police and armies backed by the soviets and cubans if they are willing to be ruthless and brutal can do a great deal to stop those who love freedom and the fact is that those who wish to be free in the absence of some kind of strength may lose their freedom to a slavery imposed by tyrants i would ask if i might for just a moment to go through the recent repressive actions the communists have taken which include the following on may 31 mario alegria and pablo morales two officials of privatesector research institutes were detained by the secret police their personal materials seized and houses searched imagine if members will that the american federal bureau of investigation had gone into the brookings institution and the heritage foundation here in washington and arrested two officials because the reagan administration did not agree with their views that would give one some idea of what the communist government in nicaragua did on may 31 on june 1 the interior ministry ordered radio catolicas news program to shut down for 10 days and radio corporacions news programs to close for 8 days for quoting from a resistance press release in other words imagine cbs news was ordered off the air for 10 days and that nbc news or abc news was ordered off the air for 8 days or cnn was ordered off the air because the government did not like what they were saying that is what the nicaraguan communists are doing on june 9 15 members of a delegation of leaders of the democratic opposition were arrested as they peacefully walked to the national assembly to petition for repeal of the media law under which independent radio news programs had been suspended imagine if you will that 15 members of the democratic party arrived in atlanta and were arrested because they disagreed with the reagan administration on june 23 liberal party members were sentenced to 90day prison terms for distributing peace literature i think this is an important thing for our friends on the american left to understand those in nicaragua who want peace and freedom are threatened by the secret police threatened by the communist army threatened by a communist dictatorship to simply wish for freedom as those who opposed nazi germany discovered to their horror without the strength to uphold freedom is to risk slavery or death on july 3 as an example of that death trade union leader carlos garcia was shot in the head in his home by police who were ostensibly advising him to report for reserve military service in other words if one is a union leader who believes in freedom and in free trade unions in communist nicaragua one may be shot in ones own home and killed by the secret police on july 10 the police violet tly broke up a peaceful march of 3 000 persons in nandaime fortythree persons were arrested again we are going to see in atlanta back home in georgia we are going to see thousands of protesters demonstrating outside the democratic convention and we are going to see politicans of the opposition party gathering peacefully and imagine that 43 were to be arrested myriam arguello was taken from her home early the morning of july 10 and that is the secret police invaded her home to arrest her in order to intimidate those who want to be free finally on july 11 the sandinistas the nicaraguan communists suspended the publication of the newspaper la prensa for alleged subversive activities and closed radio catolica for reporting the nandaime demonstration the point of reading that list is this there is an unequivocal set of recent repressive action that the nicaraguan communists have taken those actions are indisputable the new york times reports them the washington post reports them no one doubts that they have been taken those actions after the nicaraguan communists have met in secret with the speaker of this house and those actions after the leftwing democrats in this house have cut off aid to the freedom fighters those actions after the leftwing democrats promised us that if only we were reasonable the nicaraguan communists would be reasonable i think there is a great burden that the democrats leadership in this house has to look up to that governor dukakis has to meet next week and that is very simple what are we going to do in america when faced on our southern border

antiamerican and consistently prosoviet embracing the soviet model he has established a marxistleninist party a vast network of informers and secret police state ownership and the collectivization of

today and have been talking about over the past few weeks and that is the contra military offensive or lack of progress therein last week the contras staged a major attack in northern nicaragua on san jose de bocaythe site of the most important military operations base of the sandinista army in northern nicaragua the contras claimed they had destroyed the military barracks and occupied the airstrip at bocay and heralded the attack as their biggest victory in their 6year war against the nicaraguan government if this was one of the greatest military successes of the contras then the american people should meet with grave skepticism future reagan administration claims that the contras are about to march into managua according to a july 19 article in the new york times it appears the only success of the attack was the killing of nine soldiers and four innocent civiliansthree children and a pregnant woman there was no evidence of damage to either the towns dirt airstrip or the small collection of shacks that serves as the local headquarters for the nicaraguan army the rebels who have never managed to seize and hold a nicaraguan town in 6 years reached the edge of san jose de bocay but advanced no further in contrast the damage wrought on civilian property was very great more than a dozen homes were burned and cattle and other private property was stolen by the contras the three dead children ranged in age from 3 years to 13 years the woman 18 was in the fifth month of her third pregnancy of the 30 wounded in the attack 18 were civilians among them was maria cecilia novoa fonseca a 12year old girl who was hit by shrapnel which lodged in her throat adolfo novoa described the death of his 13year old daughter as follows a bunch of contras just shot machine guns into my house as they ran by my little girl was hit and died right away i cant overemphasize the importance of this attack and the lessons that can be drawn about the contras and their methods two weeks ago lt col oliver north described with great fervor and elan the contra cause and the legitimacy of their battle with the nicaraguan government many people in this country were moved by the sincerity of norths testimony and were favorably impressed by his description of the contras but the portrayal north gave of the contras is pure bunk the bottom line is in 6 years of combat 6 years the contras have still not been able to capture and hold a single nicaraguan town or piece of territory not a single town contra attacks kill more civilians than soldiers too often the victims are women and children the contras seem more interested in seizing food and personal property than military bases the only targets the contras have had any success at destroying are soft economic targets that are difficult to defend targets such as electric pylons or grain cooperatives even health clinics have been torched by the contras san jose de bocay is one of the poorest settlements in nicaragua even under the best of circumstances the townspeople are barely able to survive many of its occupants had already come down from the mountains to escape the contras after the contra attack they have no food no clothes not even a home one of the stolen cows had provided milk for an entire family with seven children if the refugees were to return to their homes in the mountains now they would most certainly be killed how can the contras ever hope to win the hearts and minds of the nicaraguan people if they continue to use tactics such as these in january this year retired army general paul gorman the former commander of unitedstates military forces in central america told congress that the contras were incapable of defeating the sandinista army in a january 29 1987 washington post report gorman said the 100 million approved by congress last year for the contras is not going to do it the money youre going to spend this year isnt going to do it i must ask my colleagues how we can contemplate continued funding for a rebel force which claims the killing of three children and a pregnant woman as its greatest military success it is immoral for the unitedstates government to continue funding a guerrilla force that has no hope of military victory that destroys civilian lives and property indiscriminately that has no base of popular support among the nicaraguan people and in fact would not exist were it not for the support of united states tax dollars the june 1 issue of newsweek contained an eyewitness account by reporter rod nordland who spent a week with the contras traveling through the jungles of northern nicaragua nordlands account paints the most vivid picture to date of the contras it explains why they will never win the war with the nicaraguan government and why they will never win the hearts of the nicaraguan people nordland says of the contras during their march together in may of last year perhaps from frustration as much as fatigue the march corroded both discipline and comradeship the quest for food outweighed any hunger for combat every campesino hut became a target often other contra units had cleaned out houses before we got to them there were no eggs because the hens had become contra fryers no milk because the cows had become contra beef frequently there werent even beans the contras made a show of paying for these things when they took them but that was little solace as the men in the column grew hungrier fewer bothered with the nicety of paymentespecially after they lost wads of their food money gambling why not make me a gift of this chicken one would ask no one ever refused fright ened peasants become instant if temporary collaborators when scores of heavily armed hungry men drop in for breakfast there is not overt coercion the physical appearance of the contras is usually sufficient many of the men have skulls and crossbones tattooed on their arms or painted on their shirts or boast names like exterminator and dragon hard pressed by sandinistas on the hunt the contras also forced campesinos to scout for them and worse to walk on their point the first man in the column to make sure we werent falling into a trap they bragged that these men were their collaborators but when we talked to them privately it was clear they felt more like human mine detectors the contras were great at retreating attacks they never quite managed one after another we abandoned targets assigned us by the high command the conduct of the sandinistas made a striking contrast with the contras their discipline held firm after many months many told us they hadnt seen a paved road or had a cold drink in 15 months of steady action where it had taken a mere 3 weeks for the contras we accompanied in the same mountains to turn into an unruly scourge sandinista troops on the march never even stopped at a peasants house except with permission from an officerand then only to wait outside for drinking water when they did requisition food the campesinos told us they always paid that is the end of the quote of mr nordlands description of what it is like being with the contras in the middle of a war and it was done last january we cannot expect the american people to support indefinitely a war the contras can never hope to win six more years of hundredmilliondollar installments would still not result in victory for the contras the sandinistas are surviving and are likely to do so for some time continued unitedstates funding of a rebel force which has no hope of military victory would surely be the most detestable atrocious immoral crime that has yet been committed in this long ugly struggle i call upon my colleagues for their help in drawing a swift and a final conclusion to this ugly spectacle now i was in a meeting and i did not hear the previous special orders i understand questions were raised about photos that scores of my colleagues showed here earlier in the day photos i might add of women children teachers maimed wounded during contra attacks and where they came from well they came from witness for peace program and as usual some of my colleagues attacked that organization and the people they represent the people on their board as having leftist leanings and questioning their patriotism is it not sad in the year in which we celebrate the constitution of this country its bicentennial the ability to speak freely on this floor or in villages and cities throughout this country that opponents of this program that we are trying to bring forward to the american people supporters of the presidents program will try to stifle that free speech would paint a dark gloomy red picture of those who take exception to their concept of what is happening in central america but they should know when they do that they not only attack me and my staff and the people that work for me and the people in the witness for peace program and the 2 500 people that witness for peace has sponsored in their witness to the war in nicaragua but they attack the board of the witness for peace they attack the american religious community they attack the two catholic bishops who serve on that board they attack representatives of the presbyterian church the united church of christ the episcopalian church the president of the conservative baptist seminary and if they are comfortable stifling those voices i think they make a tragic mistake witness for peace has sent 2 500 american citizens to central america from every state in this union representing 24 religious traditions volunteers travel at the invitation of central american churches the group is committed to nonviolence and neither receives or gives any aid to any government in the region the pictures we used are from welldocumented contra attacks documented by at least two eyewitnesses the bulk of the pictures were taken from a landmine attack on october 20 1986 this incident has been documented in the new york times on october 23 as well as in the americas watch report of december 1986 contra abuses my friends and colleagues are real they are well documented and as much as people would like to paint them over as red and deny that they ever happened they are real the people of this country have a right to know about them religious leaders of this country have spoken out against the contra war who have seen the contra terror with their own eyes have a right to speak about them time and time again this administration has tried to silence its critics by resorting to smearing the names of those who dissent from this policy the american people will not stand for this we will not see our own religious and political leaders names publicly stoned i say to you and i say to my colleagues and friends that we have reached a shameful point in american politics when the ability to speak freely without our patriotism being questioned is raised to the level that it has been raised in the past couple of weeks it only tells me the fear in the hearts of the people who oppose our position on this issue and it is that fear that will permeate the souls of the american people and will put an end

their ranching operations to the area north of the arsenal the lands claim that both the family members and their livestock suffered neurological disorders eventually half of mr lands calves developed

peaceful settlement with them this measure also authorizes funds for the contadora peace process and urges the president to resume bilateral talks with the nicaraguan government and to persuade other central american nations to join with the united states in using economic sanctions to pressure the nicaraguan government into changing its policies the single greatest issue in determining this nations policy toward the situation in nicaragua is whether or not we are willing to accept the establishment of another marxistleninist beachheadlike cubain the western hemisphere to fail to recognize the threat the sandinista government poses to the security of central america and the united states is to bury our heads in the sand the head of our own intelligence agency bill casey tells us that since 1979 when the sandinistas seized control over the government they have developed the best equipped military in the region he estimates the sandinistas have 6 000 to 7 500 cuban advisers and another several hundred other communists from the soviet union and eastern european soviet bloc countries to assist in their military buildup and consolidation of power if we allow the soviets and cubans to develop this powerful beachhead in central america and that ferment spreads our nation will know a security threat that we cannot abide clearly there is only one choice consistent with our national security and foreign policy objectives we must apply pressure from all possible sources to make the sandinistas call a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table with the democratic resistance known as the contras this will be especially difficult at a time when nicaraguas conversion to a marxistleninists state is 80percent complete they are already suppressing the press and expelling those not on their side they are arresting and imprisoning political opponents they are exporting communism to other countries they are tightening down more on the private sector and the evidence goes on down the line that the sandinistas are crs426 intent on following everything cuba has done it is also an unfortunate political reality that marxist governments do not revert to democratic forms of government not one of the some 21 countries that have gone communist have been reversed in nicaragua however there is somewhat of a unique situation a grassroots resistance movement is fighting for a democratic form of government and the same kinds of freedoms this country enjoys but the leaders of the democratic resistance emphasize shortages of food medicine and clothing which severely impede their ability to successfully wage their fight by passing the michel amendment we can encourage and help the democratic resistance continue and bestow legitimacy on their efforts thus we would send a clear message to the sandinistas and to neighboring countries whose borders have been violated that we intend to protect the freedoms and the democratic form of government in this hemisphere if we are going to provide aidhumanitarian or otherto the contras we had better do it now and in a fashion that doesnt slowly bleed them to death and diminish the strongest incentive for the sandinistas to negotiate there are those critics who charge any support for the democratic resistance will result in the united states entering the war in nicaragua with our own military forces the president himself has clearly told us his administration does not seek the military overthrow of the sandinista government or to replace it with supporters of the old somoza regime we certainly dont want another vietnam on our hands we certainly must never again get into a situation that we dont intend to win but whether or not this country would ever have to make the tough decision of military intervention is not the issue at this time lets first utilize all the peaceful means that are available through the michel amendment to try to accomplish our objective of preventing another marxistleninist beachhead we better not keep sticking our heads in the sand and say the situation in nicaragua will go away by itself because that simply will not happen its a lot easier to pay for peace now by helping those grassroots resistance forces who want freedom for themselves and are willing to fight for it than to pay for war with our own blood on a far larger

to address the administrations opposition to this bill few members of this body have been more supportive of the administration than i however i believe the administration is wrong on the three points of objection it has raised the administrations first objection states that the bill authorizes 40 7 million more in fiscal year 1988 than was requested actually the committee recommends an increase of 11 9 million above the request as follows there is plus 2 3 million for landsat 4 and 5 and advanced system studies both landsat 4 and 5 are operating beyond their designed lifetime but continue to provide data to users through eosat the additional 23 million provided by the committee in fiscal year 1988 will assure continued operation of the system through the fiscal year as well as provide additional funds to begin development of a muchneeded advanced technology civil earth remote sensing satellite there is plus 6 7 million for severe storm research these additional funds maintain this important research at the fiscal year 1987 level aimed at a wide variety of activities including industry and agriculture and protecting the lives and property of our citizens there is in this bill plus 1 7 million for fire weather agriculture weather and fruit frost warnings these consist of daily forecasts for fire danger rating computations spot forecasts for wildfires and onsite mobile units for large fires within national parklands they include observations forecasts warnings and advisories and issuing of warnings of low temperatures that are especially important in citrusfruitgrowing areas these are services central to the mission of the national weather service and should be maintained finally plus 1 2 million for climate forecast centers these funds are necessary to maintain the current centers these centers are an important link that bring together federal state and private institutions to produce and disseminate climate data and information the committee intends that these climate forecast centers continue and that access to climate data and products be maintained the administrations second objection is that the bill would prematurely authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1989 i cannot agree with this the committee on science space and technology is very familiar with the programmatic and funding needs of noaa for fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1989 and these are covered in this bill there is no need for either the committee or the house to devote additional time to noaas fiscal year 1989 authorization finally the administration objects that the bill would impose restrictions on the department of commerces ability to manage effectively the national weather service through closings or consolidations of offices all the bill requires is certification from the secretary of commerce prior to any closing consolidation automation or relocation of any weather service office this provision does not in any way hinder the secretary from taking such actions but only that congress be notified in advance it should be noted that the national weather service has proposed to close 7 offices and reduced staffing in 21 other offices in each of the last 3 years without success because of congressional actions by establishing a procedure for such closings or consolidations the committee has improved rather than hindered the departments ability to manage the national weather service in summary i cannot agree with any of the administrations objections to s 1667 i want to reaffirm my strong support for the bill and i urge my colleagues to vote for it"],

speak to the record for the future as well as to extend our deepest sympathies and affection for jean and for the entire grotberg family i miss john very much and as a democrat who sat on the other side of the aisle from him in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs i still find myself looking down to where his chair was we had the opportunity to work together on several bills and i came so much to appreciate his quick wit and wry humor i think even in his brief time here i could see the imprint of his experience in the illinois legislature when you saw him function as an effective member of our committee we were abletogether and just for the record i wanted to say that the last bill that he had a hand in here was public law 99202 december 23 1985 the save for the usa year which had to do with savings bonds and increasing the sale of our public debt securities to unitedstates citizens he and i worked on that together for a very long period of time and it is really the bill that permitted me to get to know him better as a person i thought for the record it might be interesting just to tell the story of this bill and how very much it meant to him we had to get signatures we had to get 218 signatures and he knew i was interested in savings bonds and he was as well so we decided to hitch up as a team within about 2 days john had over 70 signatures i said gosh john i said i cant keep up with you i said how in the world do you do it he said i know how to work a cloakroom we within just a few days had the required number of signatures and in that particular session of congress we had the only bill that managed to make it through that committee get passed on the floor of this house as well as over on the senate side and be signed into law by the president of the united states when we were getting our signatures on this side i said gosh john i said weve got a problem over in the other body theyre not moving very quickly he goes no problem follow me so we went out this middle door we walked across the rotunda we went over to the senate side and we went into the cloakroom over there and of course i was a little cautious i wanted the officer to clear me to go into the cloakroom and john said just walk right in we walked in and he said to the person at the desk wheres dole well it turned out that the majority leader at that time was in an airplane somewhere over the united states and john made sure that we made a telephone call right there and within 10 minutes senator dole was back to us in the cloakroom and john said when can you schedule it on the floor the senator informed us we should go see the speaker pro tem strom thurmond and we got off the telephone at that time senator dole had two huge boxes of chocolate candy over in the senate john and i both managed to grab a couple handfuls of that candy on the way out the door and we proceeded to find the speaker pro tems office without any knocking or anything john walked right in to the office and he said to the young woman sitting at the desk wed like to speak to the speaker pro tem who was standing back in the corner completely startled that these two members from the other side would have walked in unannounced like that and john walked up to him and said i happen to be a freshman this lady is a sophomore and we dont have anything important to do over there were just lowerranking members so we decided to really get on savings bonds this year and push them and we need your help we need your signature and heres the bill and senator thurmond stood there and kind of looked at this bill and looked at the two of us and it had to be one of the most unusual requests he had ever had and we got his signature within 15 seconds it was in that way then that we got the bill moved over in the senate senator dole scheduled it the next day and it passed the senate on december 16 1985 after having passed the house here on december 12 1985 it was then signed by the president i said to john before we left washington you know john this is such a big thing weve got to promote savings bonds in america when can we go over to the white house we have to get the president involved in this the first lady involved in this he said well why dont we do it in january i said ok john when he said well you take care of it im going on vacation i said oh john you have to be back here for that you cant miss an event like that that was the last time that i really had an opportunity to speak with him i never knew he was ill and he was going into the hospital that christmas and when i got back here in january to try to recoup and to put our agenda together to go over to the white house i found that he was in intensive care never to come out again last year i had to go before the national committee the private sector group that promotes savings bonds sales in the united states and to accept a liberty bell on behalf of both john and myself for our efforts in promoting this particular legislation which resulted last year in the largest number of savings bonds sales in the united states in several decades i will tell you it was a very emotional moment for me because i felt that i wanted to say so many things for john he was alive at that point and i wanted him to be there with me and he was not able to be there so i think this bill and the savings bonds sales in 1986 are a true tribute to him it has been an honor to have served with john grotberg he put a human face on this house and i pray for him and for his family"]], "top_unsure":

bringing sex education to the people of america as it relates to reducing the incidence of pregnancy and reducing abortions in our country it is relevant because surgeon general koop his main thrust up until now of dealing with this epidemic is education that is how we are going to educate the american public to reduce the incidence of aids dr koop is essentially rejecting any public health options or policy alternatives that he should be pursuing but on the point of what experience we have had and the money we have spent on family planning in 1971 we spent about 80 million on family planning activities and the incidence of pregnancies per 1 000 in women 15 to 19 was 64 by 1980 that sum for family planning had increased by almost a factor of four a little less than 300 million would my colleagues believe that the pregnancies per 1 000 in the age group 15 to 19 went up from 64 to 95 in other words we quadrupled the expenditures for family planning and we increased by a factor of 50 percent the incidence of pregnancies in teenagers in the group 15 to 19 on the growth of abortions in that same age group 15 to 19 per 1 000 it went from 19 to 42 in other words the more money the federal government spent for sex education and family planning in america the more was the increase in the incidence of abortions and pregnancies in teenage children in america i cite that as relevant to the suggestion that we can control the aids epidemic by just spending hundreds of millions of dollars to educate the american public as to the problem and danger of irresponsible sex as a means of showing that those who engage in irresponsible sex are increasing their risk of getting aids i think it will have just the opposite effect the more money the government spends for sex education the more sexual promiscuity we are going to have in our society and increased chances we are going to have of people getting aids the tragedy of the irresponsible approach that dr koop has taken is this idea that there is such a thing as safe sex it is fair to say that there may be safer sex but a condom used in anal intercourse has a very high failure rate some researchers say 40 to 50 percent and even in vaginal intercourse a failure rate of 6 to 10 percent so the suggestion that if we only arm ourselves with condoms we americans can avoid aids is the height of irresponsibility another feature about the deficiency of dr koops report is the tragedy of the chief health officer of this nation failing to recognize and affirm the inseparable link between human sexuality and morality and ethics that is a tragic failure on the part of dr koop dr koop recognized that from the standpoint of the family influence on the issue but dr koop ignored totally when he released his report to the nation last october that inseparable relation between human sexuality morality and ethics i think that was a basic defect in his approach my concern is that if we pursue this course of socalled spending hundreds of millions of dollars for education and not at the same time talk about affirming the heterosexual ethic as a foundation of our western civilization that the ideal in our society of human sexuality as expressed within the confines of a marriage between a man and a woman that is the ideal and we should not apologize to anyone in america for affirming that as the ideal but some of our chief officials at the federal level dr koop for one and others in state governments around the country are not willing to affirm that basis today and it is a tragedy as a part of the

drugs has to be incredibly misguided but my favorite philosopher as people who know me know is a fellow named archy the cockroach and archy wrote an old book back in the 1920s which is my bible when it comes to human nature and human foibles one of the things that archy said is did you ever notice that when a politician does get an idea he usually gets it all wrong let me simply say that i fully respect the gentleman from pennsylvanias concern about the drug problem and his desire to try to create a social atmosphere in this country which pressures people through social mores and other devices into refusing to use drugs certainly everybody applauds that intention my problem is that i take this job seriously in fact some people i suppose think i take it too seriously but my concern with this amendment as offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania is that i really believe that it diverts attention from the real action which is needed if we are going to engage in a real as opposed to a sham war against drugs we need massive drug education in the early grades ve need more resources committed to prosecutors offices to the courts to the coast guard and we need more help to governments who are fighting to reduce the control of the medellin cartel and other drug cartels around the world we need more tough action in this country but this walker amendment sort of reminds me of the folk song army back in the 1960s the people who would sing a song about the war rather than trying to debate seriously about it there was a song written about them and tom lehrer used to sing it and he talked about the folk song army and the theme of the song was ready aim sing i would suggest that the motto for the walker amendment would be ready aim pose for political holy pictures because i think that while its intention is certainly good it is so carelessly thought out and so wacky in its implementation that it weakens longterm support for serious efforts to get at drug abuse no one can take it seriously if a contractor is required as the result of one employee using drugs that contractor loses his federal contracts or if a company for instance which has worked for 3 years to get a union to accept a collective bargaining agreement under which drug testing is required and drug rehabilitation is required if anyone is found guilty of using drugs in a plant is then told sorry but that is not enough you have to lose your federal contract if one worker decides to get out of line i have had a good many members come up to me and simply say that they know that the walker amendment is unworkable that it is outlandish but they say please leave it alone just fix it up in conference i have to say there is nothing so pitiful as a groupof panicked politicians in full flight

seems to me that if we are really serious in applying this business to american industry and to american government and to the american military then we ought to apply it to foreign governments to foreign military entities who receive taxpayers money under this bill that is all this amendment does it clarifies the walker amendment to make sure that it is applied also to any government that receives federal money under this foreign aid bill and to any military which would be using american taxpayers funds as a result of that appropriation what it says is that if we are going to screw up an american businessmans operation because of the underlying conduct of one worker then what it says to honduras is sorry but if your ambassador to panama is going to try to bring cocaine into this country you get no money from us it says that if we really want to play king canute and pertend we can tell this country that the drug tide shall not rise simply by having a missive like on the floor

understand the importance of having an effective foreign aid program i believe however that foreign aid is a twoway street that is while we may be willing to give aid to the extent that we are able our friends and allies that are the recipients of that aid must also do their part to try and develop their economies so that eventually they can stand on their own el salvador is a case in point there is no nation that has suffered more during this decade from political strife than el salvador this strife has naturally caused a great deal of economic hardship for the people of el salvador that is why a ceasefire and real effort toward bringing peace to that nation is so important i believe president duarte is making an effort but he must do more he must work with the unions and he must work with the private sector he and his government must attempt to rebuild the salvadoran economy as they try to build democracy i believe the two go hand in hand peace and democratic institutions cannot take hold if there is economic chaos and economic stability cannot exist unless there is a partnership between the government the unions and private enterprise since taking over as chairman of the banking committees subcommittee on international finance trade and monetary policy i have come to appreciate just how important the economic side of international relations is for determining the political fate of a nation so it is throughout central america nations as diverse as nicaragua and el salvador cannot function properly if they are choking off theright of workers and businessmen a do not mean to exaggerate the case of el salvador or for that matter compare president duarte with daniel ortega there is no comparison president duarte is trying to build a democracy and has been for several years my point is this labor and business are the backbone of any democracy perhaps they should be listened to a little more not only in el salvador but throughout the region if political stability that is democracy is to thrive that way we can be sure that the foreign aid dollars we give are well spent"], [0.00028461217880249023, 0.5002846121788025, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may oonstime h r 5552 is identical to s 2130 senator wilsons bill it requires the consumer product safety commission to amend its regulations to revoke an existing exemption to the ban on lawn darts under present regulations lawn darts are banned unless the boxes in which they are sold contain a prominent warning and the lawn darts are not sold in toy stores or the toy departments of other stores the consumer product safety commission has found however that this exemption has largely swallowed the rule many lawn dart sets are being sold in or near toy departments and many do not bear the proper warnings these lawn darts because of their metal construction and weighted tips have a significant potential to injure or even kill persons especially children the staff of the cpsc has estimated that an average of 670 lawn dart injuries per year require treatinent in hospital emergency rooms over 75 percent of the victims were under the age of 15 years most tragically three youngsters have been killed by lawn darts when the dart penetrated the skull to its credit the cpsc has recognized the hazards posed by lawn darts on october 20 1987 the commission published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on march 2 1988 the cpsc voted to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to ban lawn darts that are designed to stick in the ground on may 25 cpsc approved the notice prepared by the staff and it was published on july 29 1988 i understand that the commission plans to meet soon to adopt the rule set for in that notice in addition cpsc has taken action against store chains found to be selling lawn darts in violation of the regulations and sears agreed to voluntarily cease selling such darts while it might be argued that this legislation is unnecessary in light of the existing cpsc action i believe that this bill expresses the concern of congress that this hazard be addressed and i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it i yield 18 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania"]]}
