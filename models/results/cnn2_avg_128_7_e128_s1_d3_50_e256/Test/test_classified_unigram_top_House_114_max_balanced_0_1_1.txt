{"top_correct": [[0.0, 0.0, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman as profoundly tragic as it is no one should have been surprised by the recent revelations that planned parenthood is harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of god and the inhumanity of

have a lateterm saline abortion this method of abortion burns the baby inside and out blinding and suffocating the child who is then born dead usually within 24 hours instead of dying after 18 hours of being burned in my mothers womb i was delivered alive in an abortion clinic in los angeles on april the 6th 1977 my medical records state born alive during saline abortion at 6 am thankfully the abortionist was not at work yet had he been there he would have ended my life with strangulation suffocation or leaving me there to die instead a nurse called an ambulance and i was rushed to a hospital doctors did not expect me to live i did i was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy which was caused by a lack of oxygen to my brain while surviving the abortion i was never supposed to hold my head up or walk i do and cerebral palsy is a great gift to me gianna asked the committee if abortion is about womens rights then what were mine you continuously use the argument if the baby is disabled we need to terminate the pregnancy as if you can determine the quality of someones life is my life less valuable due to my cerebral palsy you have failed in your arrogance and greed to see one thing it is often from the weakest among us that we learn wisdomsomething sorely lacking in our nation today and it is both our folly and our shame that blinds us to the beauty of adversity gianna

is worthy of support but nonetheless i will take a shot at it we can build 9 or 10 pits a year now if we go to two shifts we could build 20 the only reason we would need 80 has to do with a revamped refurbished nuclear bomb which i will talk about tomorrow morning because at the request of the majority i was asked to put it off until tomorrow morning in any case where are we today we have enough nuclear weapons to pretty much destroy the entire world or any enemy that would like to take us on do we need to have 80 new nuclear pits a year in all the testimony i have heard in the various classified sessions the answer is we would like to have it we would like to have that capability because sometime maybe somehow we may have a nuclear war and we will expend all of our existing bombs and we will need to somehow make more i am not exactly sure why we would be making more after a nuclear war but there are some who would argue that would be necessary i dont get it i really dont understand when we have the capability to build sufficient nuclear bomb components the pit the plutonium pit why we would want to spend a few billion dollarsan unknown number by the way not unlike the mox facility it is likely to rapidly escalate but our los alamos scientists would like to have something new and fancy when something old is quite necessary my wife always said that there is a choice between nice and necessary i have yet to hear the argument for necessary why we should set our path on spending several billion dollars on a new pit production facility i am sure there is some

sustainable growth rate formula unfortunately we return to the floor this week with legislation intended to further undermine the doddfrank financial reform law and give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest americans by repealing the estate tax without even finding an offset thereby increasing our deficit what we should be doing today is considering legislation to strengthen financial protection for consumers create jobs and ensure the continuation of our economic recovery or in honor of equal pay day we should debate and vote on the paycheck fairness act to ensure that women get paid for equal work a fulltime working woman still earns significantly less than what a man earns for comparable work it turns out that women earn nearly 25 cents less than a man for doing the same work achieving equal pay for women should be the top of our priority list but unfortunately this republican majority has denied us a vote on this critical issue today instead we will consider two pieces of legislation under a closed process to roll back important doddfrank consumer protections h r 650 the preserving access to manufactured housing act strips from manufactured homeowners critical protections enacted by congress as part of the doddfrank financial reform law manufactured homes are an important affordable housing option for many low and moderateincome families especially families living in rural areas it is critical that these homeowners are able to have access to the same consumer protections afforded to consumers with traditional mortgages h r 685 the mortgage choice act would allow mortgages with higher fees to improperly qualify for the qualified mortgage standards established by the consumer financial protection bureau by removing affiliated title insurance fees from the 3 percent cap established by the cfpb creditors could be incentivized to direct borrowers to expensive affiliates passage of this legislation could ultimately drive up the cost of mortgages limit competition in the marketplace and undo borrower protections a coalition of civil rights organizations including the center for responsible lending the leadership conference on civil and human rights the naacp and i could go on and on and on has urged the house to reject these bills as they could trigger the return of predatory lending irresponsible underwriting excessive fees and the lax regulatory environment that sparked the housing crisis now i know that my friends in the majority dont like the doddfrank financial reform law they have made countless attempts to overturn the commonsense provisions contained in the law that protect consumers and work to prevent another financial crisis but i dont think anybody in this house should want to set the stage for another financial crisis and i have serious concerns about the process being used by the majority to repeal doddfrank my friend the ranking member on the financial services committee maxine waters has worked in good faith with the majority on legislation to make technical corrections to doddfrank and other bipartisan updates in fact just yesterday this house passed several pieces of legislation from the financial services committee with overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle but the two bills that we are considering today fall far short of that goal after the passage of a clean homeland security bill and the sgr fix i had hoped that bipartisan cooperation in legislating would be contagious i was wrong today the republicans are back to their old ways of bringing up my way or

manufacturing we can all agree on that on both sides of the aisle the disagreement occurs when the other side the republicans are asking us in this congress to make a hasty decision that could undermine the advantage that we are now experiencing in the rapid increase in manufacturing this bill runs the risk of reducing our competitive advantage that we have now in the manufacturing sector it requires doe to rush its process and make final decisions on pending applications to export a huge quantity of lng if all of the pending applications are granted doe will authorize the export of approximately 38 million cubic feet per day of lng that is more than half of the total unitedstates natural gas consumption it is more than the worlds largest lng exporter qatar currently makes each and every day there is no question in my mind or in the minds of the american people that exports of that magnitude will increase the domestic price of natural gas it just makes common sense and it is what the eia found when it studied the economic impact of increased lng imports where is your study how do you answer the conclusions of the eia when it found again that the economic impact of increased influence will increase the domestic price of natural gas what amount of american manufacturing what amount of american jobs lets protect american manufacturing lets protect american jobs

let me offer my appreciation to the gentlewoman from minnesota the gentleman from california and their staff who have worked with us let me remind my colleagues that just a few days ago i offered this amendment dealing with museums and dealing with my concern for the funding and the smithsonian to provide for the nations museum let me also say to my colleagues that i have offered this amendment in the past because i have a particular interest in the museums of america and their ability to do outreach i imagine i am not alone standing here amongst appropriators to again say and call for the end of sequestration to be able to provide the appropriators and to provide the people of america the full funding to address these quality of life issues from the various lands and federal parks and as well the historic trails of which i will talk about but museums urban reforestation all elements of the beauty of this nation and i frankly believe that museums likewise are that form of beauty my amendment specifically says none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution in order to fulfill the smithsonians mission the increase and diffusion of knowledge the smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater audience by bringing the smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amounts of cultural history offered by the smithsonian our museums of the nation are in trouble the smithsonian has a beautiful array of museums that are here that millions of americans have the opportunity to visit but the outreach program serves millions of americans thousands of communities and hundreds of institutions in all 50 states through loans of objects traveling exhibitions and sharing of educational resources via publications lectures and presentations training programs and web sites allow me to mention just a few in my own district the holocaust museum unique in its presentation of a horrible time in history but it also serves as a very unifying entity in our community the childrens museum as one of the original board members and founders now the childrens museum is one of the major childrens museums in the nation but again it needs the impact of the outreach of the smithsonian and then of course the museum of african american culture headed by a dear friend but also a champion of holding this museum together and that is john guess he needs a fuller embrace by the smithsonian including its expertise its experts its ph d s traveling efforts and again its encouragement of corporate communities to recognize the value of participating in museums the smithsonians outreach activities include the smithsonian institution traveling exhibition the smithsonian center for education and museum studies national science resources center the smithsonian institution press the office of fellowships and the smithsonian associates who are we if we do not value preserving those items that tell the varied and diverse history of america the good history of america the history that is unifying and purposeful in citing us as a country that recognizes our wonderful diversity so i ask my colleagues to support this amendment that deals specifically with allowing the outreach to the kinds of museums that really need the help of the smithsonian the smithsonian in concluding is very important to urban areas and rural areas alike and its ability or its affiliation is to build a strong national network of museums and educational organizations in order to establish active and engaging relationships with communities throughout the country again allow me to salute in particular john guess with the museum of african american culture in houston he has literally put that museum together along with his board members the smithsoniani hope they are hearing me as i am talking on the floor of the housewe need your help in houston texas we probably need your help in washington state in california minnesota new york and beyond to preserve and help these small museums throughout the nation i ask my colleagues to support not only this amendment but the museums of this nation and i say to mr calvert we had discussed this before this amendment now is a placeholder hopefully for our discussion going forward dealing with the preservation of our museums let me thank mr calvert mr simpson and ms mccollum i yield back the balance of my time mr chair thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my amendment to h r 2822 the interior and environment appropriations act of 2016 let me also thank chairman calvert and ranking member mccollum for their leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor among other agencies this legislation funds the smithsonian institution which operates our national museums including the air and space museum the museum of african art the museum of the american indian and the national portrait gallery the smithsonian also operates another national treasure the national zoo mr chair my amendment is simple but it sends a very important message from the congress of the united states the jackson lee amendment simply provides that sec none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution this amendment is identical to an amendment i offered to the interior and environment appropriations act for fy2008 that was approved by voice vote on june 26 mr chair the smithsonians outreach programs bring smithsonian scholars in art history and science out of the nations attic and into their own backyard each year millions of americans visit the smithsonian in washington d c but in order to fulfill the smithsonians mission

amount of cultural history offered by the smithsonian the smithsonians outreach programs serve millions of americans thousands of communities and hundreds of institutions in all 50 states through loans of objects traveling exhibitions and sharing of educational resources via publications lectures and presentations training programs and websites smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with smithsonian museums and research centers as well as with 144 affiliate institutions and others across the nation the smithsonians outreach activities support communitybased cultural and educational organizations around the country they ensure a vital recurring and highimpact smithsonian presence in all 50 states through the provision of traveling exhibitions and a network of affiliations smithsonian outreach programs increase connections between the institution and targeted audiences african american asian american latino native american and new american and provide kindergarten through collegeage museum education and outreach opportunities these outreach programs enhance k12 science education programs facilitate the smithsonians scholarly interactions with students and scholars at universities museums and other research institutions and disseminate results related to the research and collections strengths of the institution the programs that provide the critical mass of smithsonian outreach activity are 1 the smithsonian institution traveling exhibition services sites 2 the smithsonian affiliations the smithsonian center for education and museum studies scems 3 national science resources center nsrc 4 the smithsonian institution press sip 5 the office of fellowships of and 6 the smithsonian associates tsa which receives no federal funding to achieve the goal of increasing pubic engagement sites directs some of its federal resources to develop smithsonian across america a celebration of national pride this mobile museum which will feature smithsonian artifacts from the most iconic presidential portraits historical american flags civil war records astronaut uniforms etc to the simplest items of everday life family quilts prairie schoolhouse furnishings historical lunch boxes multilingual store front and street signs etc has been a longstanding organizational priority of the smithsonian sites mobile museum is the only traveling exhibit format able to guarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during sustained periods of economic retrenchment but also because it is imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling financially yet eager to participate in smithsonian outreach for communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic downturn the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions the mobile museum promises to answer an evergrowing demand for smithsonian shows in the field a single conventional sites exhibit can reach a maximum of 12

result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach locations to which sites shows can travel annually and in addition to its flexibility in making shortterm stops in cities and towns from coasttocoast a mobile museum has the advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people live work and take part in leisure time activities by establishing an exhibit presence in

against civilians in this country and around the world in the past few weeks we can and we should help reassure the american people that their representatives in congressthat we here in this chamberare doing everything in our power to prevent such a brutal attack from happening in any one of our communities if we do not act this week how can we go home how can we go home and look our constituents in the eyes and tell them that we are doing everything we can that we are upholding our sworn duty to protect the american people but we can act we can act and we should act today we need to close the loophole that allows dangerous people from buying guns there is no loophole more egregious more glaring or more shocking than the one that allows suspected terrorists in this country to walk legally into a gun shop to go online or to go to a gun show and purchase a weapon in order to kill american citizens this astounding loophole has allowed more than 2 000 individuals on the fbis terrorist watch list to buy weapons legally in this country in the last 11 years in that time more than 90 percent of the individuals on the watch list who have tried to buy guns have been given a green light they have been handed a gun those numbers are shocking and they are disturbing as members of congress it is our responsibility to protect all americans wherever they live and one of those areas of protection is from terror in their communities it is to keep our citizens safe what is terror there has been a lot of discussion about what terror is in its most simple sense terror is spreading fear and chaos and that is exactly what the american people are feeling right nowfear and chaos here and around the world there are no easy answers for mass shootings and there are no easy answers for combating terrorism but the fact that the answers are not easy does not absolve us of our responsibility to step up and do what is hard we are not elected to do what is easy we are not elected to do what is possible we are elected and we are sworn to do what is hard and what is necessary to protect and advance the interests of the american people now is the time to act yesterday the house voted to strengthen the security screening process for those who travel to the united states under the visa waiver program and i was proud to cosponsor that bill we acted together in this body to protect the american people while reforming the visa waiver program is a good thing it is not enough it is insufficient to the task keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists in this country on american soil is a necessary and an important step for us to take but until we have the opportunity to vote to close this loophole suspected terrorists in this country will continue to have and to use the opportunity to buy weapons in our country the simple truth for the american people to know is that we have been denied even the opportunity to vote to close this loophole and we have a bipartisan bill right now that we could act on it is time for us in this house to stand up for the safety of the american people and to stand up to the nra and others who are sowing fear and misinformation about what is possible to do to protect people i am a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan bill that would protect the american people the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act would close this loophole by banning the sale or the distribution of firearms to anyone the attorney general deems to be engaged in terrorist activities the unitedstates government already maintains a list of known and suspected terrorists if there are problems with that listand i have heard my colleagues raise that questionthen lets fix the list if there are problems with the law lets fix the bill we cant afford to remain silent we cant afford to remain passive we cant afford to be denied the opportunity to exercise our duty to vote as members of congress that is what we do and right now we are being denied that simple and straightforward right it is time it is past time for this congress to act lets keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists lets bring up the bill if you cant fly you shouldnt be able to buy a gun tonight i will be joining some of my colleagues at the third national vigil to end gun violence here on capitol hill in a church a few blocks away we will be meeting with families and survivors of gun violence from across the country from newtown connecticut in my district from aurora colorado from chicago from harlem from across this great country thousands of americans are affected every month by our inaction i am going to have a very hard time looking these folks in the eye today i ask you to join me come with me and look them in the eye and tell them why you are unwilling to take one single vote one single step to try to protect people in america we have an opportunity to change that today we have an opportunity to act together we have an opportunity to fulfill our duty to protect and defend the american people from the scourge of gun violence a simple straightforward and important way to start is to allow us to vote on this bipartisan bill that will close an absurd loophole in the law that allows terrorists to buy guns to kill americans i reserve the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[1.0, 1.0, 0, "you know you have drafted a strong bill when you unite both national security hawks and civil libertarians the usa freedom act has done that it also has the support of privacy groups tech companies and the intelligence community this bill is an extremely welldrafted compromise the product of nearly 2 years of work it effectively protects americas civil liberties and our national security i am very proud of the usa freedom act and am confident it is the most responsible path forward i do not fault my colleagues who wish that this bill went further to protect our civil liberties for years the government has violated the privacy of innocent americans and i share your anger but letting section 215 and other surveillance authorities expire would not only threaten our national security it would also mean less privacy protections i emphasize it would also mean less privacy protections the usa freedom act also ends bulk collections across all domestic surveillance authorities not just section 215 it also expands transparency with increased reporting from both government and private companies if the administration finds a new way to circumvent the law congress and the public will know the bill also requires the fisc to declassify significant legal decisions bringing an end to secret laws if the patriot act authorities expire and the fisc approves bulk collection under a different authority how will the public know without the usa freedom act they will not allowing the patriot act authorities to expire sounds like a civil libertarian victory but it will actually mean less privacy and more riskless privacy and more risk now to my colleagues who oppose the usa freedom act because they dont believe it does enough for national security this bill is a significant improvement over the status quo americans will be safer post usa freedom than they would be if congress passes a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions i am not ignorant to the threats we face but a clean reauthorization would be irresponsible congress never intended section 215 to allow bulk collection that program is illegal and based on a blatant misinterpretation of the law that said the freedom act gives the intelligence community new tools to combat terrorism in more targeted and effective ways specifically the bill replaces the administrations bulk metadata collection with a targeted program to collect only the records the government needs without compromising the privacy of innocent americans it includes new authorities to allow the administration to expedite emergency requests under section 215 and fills holes in our surveillance law that require intelligence agencies to go dark on known terrorists or spies when they transit from outside to inside the unitedstates or vice versa under current law the administration has to temporarily stop monitoring persons of interest as it shifts between domestic and international surveillance authorities what is more likely to stop the next terrorist attack the bulk collection of innocent americans or the ability to track down a known terrorist as soon as he or she enters the united states if you answer that question the same way i do then dont let the bluster and fearmongering of the bills opponents convince you we are safer with a clean reauthorization than we are with this bill attorney general lynch and director of national intelligence clapper recognize this in a recent letter of support they wrote the significant reforms contained in this legislation will provide the public greater confidence in how our intelligence activities are carried out and in the oversight of those activities while ensuring vital national security authorities remain in place lets not kill these important reforms because we wish this bill did more there is no perfect every bill we vote on could do more i play the lottery when i win i dont throw away the winning ticket because i wish the jackpot were higher it is time to pass the usa freedom act i am asking all my colleaguesdemocrats and republicans security hawks and civil libertariansto vote for it lets speak with one voice in the house of representatives and together urge the united states senate to work quickly and adopt these important reforms"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "reclaiming my time and thanking very much the gentleman from florida for the compliments and the input here too i learned something in this discussion and listening to mr yoho from florida and that is when he spoke of divine intervention in our constitution the answer required divine intervention because men just arent that smart i hadnt heard that expression in this town or anyplace that explains it in a lot of ways i have long said that i believe that the declaration of independence and the constitution are written with divine guidance i choose those terms because the bible was written with divine intervention and divine inspiration that is up here divine guidance is just a little click below that i dont want to claim biblical standards but it is really close we would not have this country if it were not for gods guidance of our founding fathers and so i tuned my ear to that i would say also whose advice should the senators listen to on the other side well they should listen to ted yohos advice i hope they are listening to my advice but those on the republican side of the aisle they are pretty solid i want to publicly and personally thank my friend whom i appreciate and respect a lot jerry moran who has been in a difficult place in kansas he is a terrific friend and i served with him here in the house of representatives his position is shored up in opposition to having hearings in the judiciary committee and trying to move this i think the reconsideration that he has done is a good thing and i hope the people of kansas understand and appreciate jerry moran in the fashion that i do as well i would suggest that maybe jerry moran and some of the democrat senators in particular may have been listening to this advice this would be advice from the vice president himself joe biden advice that he gave on june 25 1992 so it has sustained the test of time in this fashion it is called the biden rule quote from vice president joe biden it is my view that if a supreme court justice resigns tomorrow or within the next several weeks or resigns at the end of the summer president bush should consider following the practice of a majority of his predecessors and not repeats itand not name a nominee until after the november election is completed that is joe biden and at that time he was the chairman of the senate judiciary committee again that was june 25 1992 we are only a couple of months away in proportion to that in this period of time so if our friends over on the senate side are not listening to the vice president i would suggest they might listen to the senate minority leader harry reid the former majority leader in the senate this is harry reids statement made in 2005 you will note that this was back when george w bush was president harry reid minority leader today in the senate the duties of the united states senate are set forth in the constitution of the united states nowhere in that document does it say that the senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote it says appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the senate that is very different than saying every nominee receives a vote the senate is not a rubber stamp for the executive branch that is harry reid 2005 both of those gentlemen i would say today would argue against their previous arguments i am reinforcing their arguments today on the floor of the house of representatives we are not finished who is another strong influential voice over there in the senate judiciary committee senator schumer of new york he wanted to block the bush nominees and here is what he had to say he said we should not confirm any bush nominee to the supreme court except in extraordinary circumstances senator schumer cited ideological reasons for the delay and i begin another quote they must prove by actions not words that they are in the mainstream rather than we have to prove that they are not well there is a statement of ambiguity for you requiring an appointment to the supreme court to prove that they are in the mainstream what is the mainstream that would be what chuck schumer would define as the mainstream depending upon whether or not he supported the candidate that was speaking to present themselves to be in the mainstream i would argue that mainstream is not a requirement for an appointment to the supreme court the requirements for the appointment to the supreme court are determined by the discretion and the judgment of the confirming senators over on the other side of this capitol building and they should be obligated to only confirm justices who interpret the constitution to mean what it says to mean what it says is that too much to ask why then do we have a constitution if it cant mean what it says senator schumer wasnt done however he argued again in 2007 we should reverse the presumption of confirmation the supreme court is dangerously out of balance we cannot afford to see justice stevens replaced by another roberts or a justice ginsburg by another alito that was 2007 well i think the supreme court is dangerously out of balance precisely because of the justices that senator schumer supports and because there are not enough justices on the supreme court that he has opposed because i believe that the justices need to reflect and protect the text and the original understanding of the constitution every founding father believed that as well when they went to their grave and they would be rolling over in it if they saw a supreme court that was writing law on one day manufacturing commands the next day and now hearing an argument that the president of the united states has a right to his appointment to the supreme court no matter what kind of activist he might serve up that is going to visit upon the american people for at least the next generation decisions that usurp the authority of the united states house of representatives and the united states senate and commandeer the legislative authority away from article i and commandeer some kind of authority to manufacture commands as they did last june then we are not done yet in case this argument isnt strong enough at this point here is another the very individual that made the appointment to the supreme court that would be thensenator barack obama now president obama he filibustered the alito appointmentthe alito nomination excuse me here is what thensenator obama argued in 2006 well they say this now this is his spokesman today president obama regrets filibustering the nomination of supreme court justice samuel alito in 2006 this is from his top spokesman who said just a week or so ago though he maintains that the republican opposition to his effort to replace justice antonin scalia is unprecedented no the president of the united states opposition to justice alito was unprecedented not the opposition created here by chairman grassley or majority leader mcconnell and almost every republican over there in the united states senate and i dont know any republicans in the house who think they ought to move this appointment now so here are some other positions along the way regarding senator grassleys comments senator grassley made some strong positions on the floor of the senate a little over a week ago and they were published in politico as i recall where it would be this the supreme court has weighed in on this nomination and that would be chief justice roberts has intervened and made comments in this way that before scalia had passed away he argued that the confirmation process is not functioning very well that it has gotten too political i was very proud of senator grassley when he stepped up on the floor of the senate and rebutted that argument and he made the case that no the confirmation process in the united states senate has gotten political precisely because the court itself is making political decisions rather than decisions based upon the law and the supreme law of the land the constitution so when you see political decisions come out of the courtand those decisions i have described some of them there are many othersthat means that the confirmation process itself is political and when i sat before the supreme court and heard the oral arguments before the courtand i hope to do that again next weeki was amazed i expected that i would hear profound constitutional arguments before the united states supreme court i mean i grew up i guess naively believing that those were the arguments made before that court i think the warren court had already turned that thing in the other direction and i didnt realize it but when i first sat before the united states supreme court and listened for those arguments thinking it was going to be an amazing educational experience for me what i found was there werent any profound constitutional arguments made those arguments instead were being made to the swing justice on the court to try to get to that individuals heart because they understood the various proclivities in the thinking and the rationale that might come they went back and looked at the lives the lifestyle the history of the justices and wondered what moves their heart rather than what moves their rationale we should only have justices whose rationale is moved by constitutional arguments before the court lets see who else do i have president obama who made the argument that he wants appointments to the supreme court who havewhat is the word compassion empathy president obamas word is empathy we are not looking for empathy on the supreme court we are looking for justices that can rule on the letter and the text and the original meaning and understanding of the constitution and the letter and text of the law here in congress that we passed and yes they can take into consideration congressional intent but they cant amend the language if the language says one thing they dont get to add words to it they should ship it back over here and tell us what they have interpreted that it said and then the congress can decide whether or not we want to act we take an oath to support and defend the constitution that doesnt mean we are bound by a decision of the supreme court that turns the constitution on its head so this fight that is going on in the supreme court with the nomination to the court now is one that will turn the destiny of the united states of america depending on who ends up as the next president of the united states i have every confidence that senator grassley holds his ground that there will not be hearings before the united states senate judiciary committee that the senate prerogative will prevail and that the people will go to the polls in november and elect a president part of that decision will be will that president make the right appointment to the supreme court in the meantime chuck grassley the man who is now the chairman of the committee stands in the gap in the same way that leonidas stood against xerxes at the battle of thermopylae when he led the 300 to stand in that gap and face 300 000 persians he is holding his ground he is holding his ground nobly he is holding it with conviction he is holding it with determination and we need to stand with him beside him and behind him in every way that we can and understand that this is a political assault that is going at him we should reward him for his convictions by electing a president who will make that appointment to the supreme court who reflects the will of the people and the will of the people i trust will still want to see an appointment to the supreme court of a justice who would stand up and say this constitution means what it says the text of this constitution has to mean what it says and it has to be interpreted to mean that which it was understood to mean at the time of its ratification and if you dont like what it does for our policy then get to work and amend the constitution that is why that provision is there that is why we have the amendments to the constitution today so i thank senator grassley for his strong stand i thank mitch mcconnell for his leadership in the senate i thank everyone over there who holds their ground and everyone here in this congress who takes an oath to support and defend the constitution and means it i yield back the balance of my time"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "my amendment is very simple and straightforward it calls on the department of energy working together with the environmental protection agency and the office of management and budget to take another look at what is now 20yearold data about how used oil is managed in the united states and to develop comprehensive strategies to increase recycling used oil as part of a national strategy to save energy and reduce pollution right now there are options for disposal of motor oil commonly used in trucks and cars the worst option is for that oil to be simply discarded leading to contaminants polluting our air and water if properly collected the oil can be burned once for use as lowcost fuel however the best option uses modern technology which now exists to collect and sustainably recycle used oil these refining techniques can now produce a product that is the quality equivalent to fresh virgin base oils so this option also maximizes the benefits by conserving most of the energy needed to make oil while cutting emissions of carbon and other harmful pollutants rerefining can turn what used to be a waste product into an infinitely renewable resource and not only does this rerefined oil meet government and industry specifications but it is also costcompetitive reduces waste and reduces emissions earlier studies done by doe as well as our national labs show that used motor oil is a valuable and reusable energy resource as the motor sports capital of the worldindianapolis that isit is no surprise that indiana has traditionally been a leader in recycling and rerefining oil we have two major used oil refineries in indiana employing almost 1 000 people and our state has a proud tradition of utilizing this product and promoting its technology rerefined oil is already being actively used by dod and other federal agencies public and commercial fleets and average consumers with great success however far too little of our used oil is recycled in this way so my amendment is intended to increase conservation and sustainable reuse the last major federal study was called for in the energy policy act of 2005 that study was issued in 2006 but relied on data that was then 10 years old now that data is 20 years old my amendment will require the doe to update that data so that we know how much oil is available and how much is actually being reused and rerefined data from 20 years ago showed that the united states was well behind other developed and even some developing countries in terms of sustainable reuse this amendment will also provide for the development of policies that can significantly increase both the collection rate and sustainable reuse of this valuable

budget office cbo and the joint committee on taxation jct incorporate into the official cost estimates required under section 402 of the congressional budget act of 1974 budget act the macroeconomic effects of major legislation because this rule builds on the existing requirement for cost estimates it does not apply to appropriations legislation by including an analysis of how major legislation will affect the economy this rule provides the house with a more comprehensive estimate than can be produced using only the traditional conventional scoring methods which implicitly assume that legislation has no effect on the broader economy in particular this analysis is required to include the budgetary effects of changes in economic output employment the capital stock and other macroeconomic variables resulting from major legislation in addition this rule requires a qualitative assessment of the longterm budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major legislation major legislation is defined as legislation causing an increase or decrease in revenues outlays or deficits in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution equal to or greater than 0 25 percent of the projected gross domestic product for that year in applying the 0 25 percent threshold cbo and jct are required to look at the gross budgetary effects of the legislation in carrying out this requirement the intent is that cbo and jct review provisions in the bill that have a significant effect thus the test is whether any provision in the legislation has a budgetary effect larger than the threshold or if the absolute value of the sum of the provisions exceeds the threshold rather than whether the legislation as a whole has such an effect when all of the provisions are netted out alternately for legislation that may not have a large fiscal effect but would still have significant economic impacts the new rule empowers the house to designate major legislation for all legislation other than purely revenue legislation the rule authorizes the chair of the budget committee to designate major legislation for purely revenue legislation i e legislation that contains only provisions described in section 201 f of the budget act the rule authorizes the house member serving as the chair or vice chair of jct to designate major legislation for purposes of this rule the rule carefully preserves the existing division of labor between cbo and jct which requires close collaboration between these two nonpartisan institutions when major legislation involves both revenue and nonrevenue provisions cbo and jct will need to work together to produce a single integrated cost estimate for the legislation drawing on each agencys institutional responsibilities the rule requires enhanced transparency around these budgetary estimates both cbo and jct as applicable must provide together with their estimates a description of the critical assumptions and the source data underlying such estimates it is important that cbo and jct make this information available so that the public academic and other experts have an opportunity to review the analysis and pursue possible improvements in the methodologies used to develop these estimates distributional analyses of proposed tax changes that jct provides as background information is another area where estimates could be improved by incorporating macroeconomic effects into these analyses the preparation of cost estimates incorporating macroeconomic effects is frequently more complex and requires more time than the preparation of conventional cost estimates committees should therefore build in additional time to allow for the completion of the cost estimate both cbo and jct should strive to promptly produce the estimates required by this rule to the extent it is not practicable for cbo and jct to produce the required estimates the rule provides an accommodation in this instance two possible circumstances may arise when it is not feasible to produce the required analysis first committees and the house may be operating under tight deadlines and it is not possible for cbo or jct to complete the analysis prior to the legislations consideration second while cbo and jct have developed a great deal of expertise and experience in producing these analyses there may be situations where it is not possible for cbo and

concerned this resolution urges all political candidates to respect their pledges of nonviolence and insist that the government hold a free fair and credible election and that they do so on time this election date has already been postponed once meanwhile nigeria continues to face grave insecurity in the north at the hands of boko haram which loosely translates to western education is sin this islamist terrorist organization indiscriminately kills in mass and pillages villages in their quest to establish a sharia state satellite images document that after boko haram comes through villages are literally wiped off the map the group is responsible for 5 000 deaths last year in 2014 and displacing over 1 million people last year making this organization by the way one of the worlds most deadly but this weekend forces fighting boko haram reported discovering another hundred bodies in a shallow mass grave we dont really know how many they have killed out there in total but we know that the killing continues after watching boko harams violence i wasnt surprised to see that that group pledges allegiance to isis isis publicly accepted the overture claiming this new relationship expands their selfdeclared caliphate to west africa at the same time we have seen boko harams propaganda increase in quality mimicking the production of isis videos sweeping what we call the virtual caliphate on the internet so the good news is that nigerias neighbors chad niger and cameroon have all been making progress in the fight against boko haram under a newly established african union regional force they have rescued more than 30 northern nigerian towns to date from boko haram and from that harsh rule this is a good beginning but this african union regional force lacks equipment and it lacks training this resolution expresses the houses support for robust security assistance to these troops in their fight against boko haram nevertheless we cannot rely solely on other countries in the region nigerias security forces should have the lead role to play if dismantling boko haram is the goal we need a welltrained wellequipped nigerian military we must make sure there are no impediments legislative or otherwise to providing this muchneeded assistance i reserve the balance of my time"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "i thank the gentlemen for yielding i want to thank congressman desaulnier and congresswoman lee for their leadership and drawing attention to this issue and for helping to bring attention to this story of injustice the story of the port chicago 50 isnt in most textbooks or histories of world war ii but perhaps it should be while it may not be this nations proudest moment it is a part of our history and it is a tragic event from which we can learn and we can actually grow i think as a nation the enlisted men stationed at the port chicago naval magazine including the port chicago 50 served our nation proudly and they served her honorably for that they deserve our gratitude for those unfamiliar with the story and i know it has already been talked about but i would like to talk about it very briefly again following a catastrophic cargo vessel explosion on july 17 1944 which killed or wounded 710 people several enlisted men voiced concerns about continuing to handle munitions at the port among those voicing concerns were two gentlemen from cincinnati ohio from the area that i am proud to serve mentor burns and edward lee longmire both men enlisted in 1943 they were not lifelong soldiers with extensive training they were ordinary patriotic americans doing their part to help in the war effort mr burns was a woodturner in a furniture factory before enlisting mr longmire worked as a sales clerk selling poultry nothing in their background prepared them for handling munitions and unfortunately the navy at that time did not provide adequate training for the men serving at port chicago so it is understandable that the men who survived the explosion were reluctant to continue loading munitions without efforts to make the process safer for that they were charged with mutiny reluctance and even refusal to return to unsafe conditions and procedures is not mutiny it is common sense america is the greatest country on the face of the globe but that doesnt mean we dont at times make mistakes and that is what happened here injustices like the mutiny convictions for the port chicago 50 certainly fall within that category however one of the things that makes america great is the freedom of the american people and the peoples elected representatives to speak out against injustices correct past wrongs and strive for a better future for all of us we cant go back in time and prevent the convictions of the port chicago 50 but we can correct the record and we can exonerate those wrongfully convicted and give their families and their loved ones the peace of knowing that they served our nation honorably and faithfully and that they did nothing wrong it is far past time that the port chicago 50 received justice we owe it to mr burns mr longmire and the rest of those wrongfully convicted and discharged we need to set the record straight i want to thank my colleagues for making it possible for us this evening to participate in this effort"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "i thank the chairman for his leadership on this important package and i thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for his leadership and i rise in strong support of his legislation h r 37 the promoting job creation and reducing small business burdens act indeed this bill is about jobs and it is about economic growth and it is about jobs on main street make no mistake about it essentially the same legislative package passed the house last fall by a bipartisan vote of 320102 if i may i want to talk a little bit about title viii of this legislation which passed the house last april by voice vote and it contains language from a bill i introduced in the last congress h r 4167 the restoring proven financing for american employers act i worked closely with my colleague across the aisle congresswoman maloney of new york to craft sound commonsense bipartisan language to clarify the volcker rule while maintaining its original legislative intent regarding the treatment of collateralized loan obligations now lets just talk a little bit about the volcker rule and what it does as currently structured this rule will substantially disrupt the market for clos a vital source of capital for midsized and emerging growth american companies that cannot costeffectively access the corporate bond market there are two negative impacts of this rule first of all it will have a serious negative impact on banks many smalland mediumsized community banks and it is estimated that banks will have to divest or restructure up to 70 billion of clo notes under this rule if unchanged second it will compromise credit availability for american companies that are beneficiaries of this innovative source of credit today clos hold approximately 350 billion of senior secured commercial and industrial loans to some of the most dynamic jobproducing companies in america one of these companies tempur sealy international the worlds largest manufacturer of mattresses foundations pillows and other bedding products is headquartered in my district so it seems to me that the medicine being prescribed by the volcker rule forcing banks to sell billions of dollars of clo paper in a firesale scenario and the loss of credit availability for a wide range of main street businesses growing companies jobproducing employers would be a far more damaging result to jobs and the economy than the perceived disease banks ever suffering losses from holding aaa clo paper which is fundamentally different and distinguishable from the mortgagebacked securities that led to the runup to the financial crisis it is important to note what this bill does and what this title does and what it does not do it doesnt do away with the volcker rule if you listened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle you would think that we are totally doing away with the volcker rule that is not what this does what it does is it grandfathers legacy clos and prevents a fire sale of these clos so without the adoption of this grandfather provision the volcker rule would effectively operate to make illegal certain investments that were perfectly legal and safe when they were made in other words the volcker rule as currently written applies retroactively to clos attaching legal consequences to investment decisions made by private parties who did not anticipate these consequences at the time the decision was made such retroactivity will profoundly and negatively disrupt the plans and settled expectations of clo investors and this will create turmoil in the commercial credit market and force banks to sell billions of existing clo debt as a result the cost of financing will increase and access to credit will dry up and this will reduce liquidity in americas capital markets let me make a point here much has been said about wall street versus main street this is about main street jobs the unitedstates chamber of commerce the independent community bankers association and the american bankers association all talk about how this will help our bill our fix will help community banks grow capital and support local economic development and job creation on main street the bipartisan policy center says that forcing a select group of banks to sell these assets over a short time is not the optimal solution such an action would create an environment of institutions forced to sell and buyers who can purchase clos at extraordinarily cheap prices and this would create unnecessary losses at banks and produce windfall profits for those who can demand to buy them at below market rates the clo provision represents a small and commonsense solution not a rollback of doddfrank by any means it keeps the volcker rule completely intact and simply provides phasedin compliance to banks of all sizes that made sound investment decisions allowing for a finite universe of wellperforming legacy clos to be sold or paid off"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00036019086837768555, 0.5003601908683777, 0, "it is just as critical and just as vital in some ways more so in that the ultimate

today s 764 recognizes consumers demand to know more about their food by directing usda to create a national mandatory genetically engineered food labeling program my colleagues may remember that almost a year ago this chamber passed legislation to establish a voluntary labeling program i still believe a voluntary label is best but frankly if we are going to address this issueand as the chairman said we are out of timewe need to work with the senate this is the compromise that was reached and in my opinion is probably the only alternative that is available at this point science tells us that foods and ingredients from genetically engineered crops are safe to eat this technology allows farmers to protect natural resources and provide an abundant food supply unfortunately there is a lot of public confusion about these issues but labeling products is really more about marketing than any safety concerns that people have this legislation is needed to avoid a situation where 50 states set up 50 different labels which would only create confusion for consumers farmers and food companies news reports indicate that vermonts labeling law which went into effect july 1 has already led to the loss of some 3 000 products from store shelves this legislation would rectify this problem while addressing the laws shortcoming for example the vermont law exempts processed food products containing meat from labeling so cheese pizza would be labeled but pepperoni pizza would not that doesnt make any sense s 764 closes this loophole requiring an additional 25 000 food products to meet new labeling requirements i am also pleased that usda will be responsible for implementing and enforcing this program they have the expertise to do this they have shown this with the labeling that they did for the successful national organic program i would also like to note that s 764 received strong bipartisan support in the senate and more than 1 000 farm and food organizations including the american farm bureau federation grocery manufacturers association and organic trade association and others are calling for passage in closing i believe this is a good compromise it is another example

other forms of entertainment we also want talent from other countries to come to the united states for our enjoyment in such instances however we must ensure that the immigration process effectively balances the needs of the entertainment industry while protecting the rights and interests of american workers congress has long realized that this is a delicate balance which is why we created a
