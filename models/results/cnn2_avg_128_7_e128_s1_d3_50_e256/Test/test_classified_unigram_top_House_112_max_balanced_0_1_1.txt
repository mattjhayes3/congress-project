america can remain a leader in the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut cap and balance act this bill is an extreme version of the republican budget plan that would make permanent the dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires hedge fund managers and oil companies nor does it address runaway pentagon spending based on cbos most conservative estimates the dod alone is projected to spend nearly 300 billion on the afghan and iraqi wars from 2012 through 2015 and estimates by harvard researchers which take into account longterm costs like caring for our veterans put the total cost of these wars in the trillions rather than ending tax breaks for corporations and millionaires and

act boldly and to create jobs in this country to protect our safety net and to target resources where they are neededbasically to communities of color lowincome communities those communities rural areas who were hit hardest by the economic downturn its really beyond shameful that over 45 million americans including over 16 million children are living in poverty in the wealthiest nation in the world the data also shows a wide racial disparity with the poverty rates for whites standing at 9 8 percent while the rates for african americans and hispanics remain unacceptably high at 27 6 percent and 25 3 percent respectively in 2005 i founded the congressional out of poverty caucus because of the rising tide of poverty some of us saw this unfortunate day coming that was beginning under the failed policies of the previous administration of course we also know the terrible economic impact of the massive financial crisis that they left us on their way out of office with the swift efforts of president obama and congressional democrats we are finally beginning to dig ourselves out of the hole that was left by the bush administration and slowly moving the poverty rate in the right direction we must do more and we can do more one of the most critical responsibilities we have as a government is to promote and enact policies that keep our middle class strong and provide opportunities and a safety net for those striving and fighting to become middle class and to get into the ranks of the middle class to enhance their quality of life but far too many americans are continuing to suffer joblessness and have dropped out of the middle class and into poverty because of this republican donothing congress republicans in congress have continually blocked efforts to extend and expand vital safety net programs which safeguard millions of american families and children who face stark realities of unemployment hunger and homelessness further their continued blocking of critical federal support to our states and localities has caused widespread layoffs of dedicated public servants like teachers police officers and firefighters in communities all across the country this attack on our countrys public servants has had a particularly hard impact on communities of color and on women across the country i just have to tell you african americans and women have long found job opportunities in the public sector in public employment african americans in particular often found work with the city or the state because of racial bias and barriers and obstacles in the private sector the american people know that you cant have it both ways government spending cannot kill jobs on one hand when spent on hiring teachers and police officers and create jobs on the other hand and those services are desperately needed throughout our country we need more police officers on the street my colleagues on the other side of the aisle must begin to accept the reality of history federal investments in our nations infrastructure in our schools and in programs that help struggling families are critical to boosting our economy and spurring our economic recovery tax cuts for millionaires dont pay for themselves they create massive deficits and weaken our country markets dont regulate themselves deregulation allows rampant fraud and creates massive bubbles that inevitably burst and threaten our entire economy we need a balanced approach that ensures that every american pays their fair share and is invested in a united and prosperous future for all americans of every background we need a balanced approach that ensures that millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share so that we can reignite the american dream for all how this nation treats the least of these is not just a measure of our nations moral priorities but it will directly impact whether the american dream survives and thrives for all let us not forget that our greatest strength is the freedom and opportunity that our democracy created to allow us to work together to build the largest and most prosperous middle class the world has ever known but this means that we must reduce and we must eliminate poverty and i hope in the few days that were left that this congress will come together and figure out a way to pass the presidents american jobs act because in that legislation we have

apopka in florida their backbreaking work helped to provide the bulk of the winter season produce on the eastern seaboard in the early 1990s a settlement was negotiated with the large farming corporations where 20 000 acres of land were sold for roughly 100 million a negligible amount of 200 000 was allocated for the 2 500 farmworkers and most were simply given pink slips despite decades of service on the farm for years these workers were exposed to a chemical mixture of carcinogens and other contaminants as planes cropdusted the fields now these workers are suffering from an array of diseases that have been linked to longterm pesticide exposure their children suffer from defects cause by prenatal exposure to harmful contaminants these women have worked for over a decade to bring attention to their cause while many of their former colleagues unfortunately have passed away although these women are desperately seeking some relief and good health what they ask for more than anything else is their dignity dignity is the contribution of their community to feeding this nation and the sacrifices they made in doing so i would therefore offer my profound and earnest gratitude to these incredible women to their community and to farmworkers across the country for theirs truly are the hands that feed us now more than ever we need to redouble our efforts to reward hard work we must work to be sure that americans who work all of their lives have something to show for it this does not just affect linda lee or geraldine matthew we cannot ignore the fact that millions of americans have seen their retirement savings decimated their pensions shortchanged and their wages stagnant or falling even in the face of a rising tide of poverty and an economy with high unemployment the tea partyled republicans continue their efforts to slash programs which protect the health and wellbeing of millions of lowincome and working poor families in the coming weeks and months we will begin to see the impact of the quite frankly immoral cuts to vital unemployment benefit extensions as thousands of people thousands of people across our country who are struggling to find a job will be thrown off of unemployment benefits thrown off kicked off the rolls some of them may be lucky enough to find work but far too many will be suddenly cut off with nearly nothing nothing to keep them from falling behind into poverty they will have been left out and left behind we may disagree on how to help families in need and workers who are struggling find work access needed health services or feed their children but we can all agree that leaving struggling families completely cut off of unemployment insurance with nowhere to turn for help is not the american way when republican politicians protect tax cuts for millionaires we must be very adamant about protecting the working poor when tea party republicans fight to protect tax writeoffs for corporations and big oil we must fight to protect hardworking americans when republican tea party members continued to expend their energy protecting the dividend gains on investments we must fight to protect linda lee and geraldine matthew women who have worked their entire lives and are left with nothing to show for it unfortunately there are some who continue to support policies for the 1 percent where profits rather than people matter we need a jobs bill for those who are desperately in need of a job and we need to help with their support for themselves and their families so we do need a strong safety net to act as a bridge over these troubled economic times its critical to reaffirm that the needs and the aspirations of the poor and the working poor are really important and critical for us

simply about dollars and cents they are about values and priorities and the debate over spending has revealed republican priorities in my opinion in the worst possible light first republicans passed a spending plan for the remainder of the fiscal year that would cripple americas ability to outinnovate outeducate and outbuild its competitors that spending plan would cut billions in medical and energy research cut out support for 20 000 research scientists kick 200 000 children out of head start put college out of reach for millions of middle class students and end vital infrastructure projects in 40 states infrastructure projects which provide american jobs a consensus of nonpartisan economists has found that the plan will cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and mark zandi moodys analytics chief economist and an adviser to senator mccains presidential campaign said that it would cost almost 700 000 jobs in addition to these skewed priorities republicans are insisting that any bill any bill to keep the government open must also include controversial social policy provisions that have little if anything to do with the deficit even though their own pledge to america promised to end the practice of packaging unpopular bills with mustpass legislation bills that should pass on their merits not as related to some extraneous issue rather than compromise with president obama with the democrats in the senate and the house republicans are threatening once again to shut down government as they did in 1995 now they tell us that they will back off on their threat but only if we pass a partisan 1week spending bill that triples the ransom to keep the government open in other words this bill contains three times the weekly cuts as the last weektoweek bill did it also takes all cuts from only a small slice of the budget frankly that makes this latest bill a mockery of fiscal responsibility especially because it leaves entirely untouched for the rest of the year what the secretary of defense himself has called the pentagons culture of endless money this partisan patch contradicts republicans own promises to put everything on the table defense spending included listen to their own words as reported by the associated press on january 23 the houses new majority leader representative eric cantor of virginia has said defense programs could join others on the cutting board but of course they havent done that new york times january 27 representative chris gibson a tea partyendorsed freshman republican and retired army colonel made it clear that no part of the pentagons 550 billion budget some 700 billion including the wars in iraq and afghanistan was immune this deficit that we have threatens our very way of life and everything needs to be on the table however they have not done that congressman mike pence on january 7 said if we are going to put our fiscal house in order we have to be able to look at defense we need a strong defense i am a supporter of a strong defense but to take those dollars off the table is irresponsible and inconsistent with the representations that our republican friends have made those words are sounding very hollow however today why are republicans breaking their word madam speaker because in my opinion they know that the only way to get their conference to support this spending bill is to bribe it with a year of defense spending left untouched and a divisive social policy provision as well which is what they said they would not do what we need to do is sit down and over the next 72 hours now over the next 48 hours frankly come to compromise thats our job my way or the highway is never going to get it done finally republicans showed their priorities in their budget for the upcoming fiscal year we will have a lot to say about that in the days ahead their budget ends medicare as we know it seniors thought that they were going to protect medicare well their way of protecting it is ending it it dismantles medicaid and other vital programs for our seniors we will talk a lot about that in the coming days and on top of that it includes yet trillions more in tax cuts for the wealthiest americans

became the most important civil rights organization in the south during the 1960s reverend shuttlesworth was an inspiration to other activists because of his strong commitment to the fight for

american jobs act plain and simple its about addressing the deficit and providing for the dignity of work and the enhancement of services that strengthens the fabric of our communities our states our nation so the american jobs act according to experts is a phenomenal plan weve heard the republicans say we have some 30 bills that are about growing the economy and producing jobs when in fact when put under the test when reviewed by some very sound organizations out there and professional economists and analysts they said it would do precious nothing that it was not the formula its not what the doctor called for if we can stay on that healthcare related theme but the american jobs act well listen to some of the experts the chief economist at moodys analytics who by the way mark zandi was the former economic advisor for senator john mccain what does he theorize that anywhere from 1 9 million to 2 million jobs would be the outcome of the american jobs act something that not only produces the jobs but would reduce the unemployment rate by at least 1 percentage point thats a major significant factor what also happens is that when you produce those 2 million jobs youre addressing the gdp by at least 2 percentage points growth in the gdp reduction in the unemployment reducing the deficit putting people to work strengthening the economy providing purchasing power at a time when businesses are saying the best thing you can do get us customers a healthy economy putting people into the work mode creates customers it creates purchasing power it creates a strength in the economy two million jobs how can we walk away from a proposal oh i know why because there were those who spoke before cameras reaching all of america saying anything this president offers we wont do our goal is to make him a oneterm president my friends that is putting partisan politics petty partisan politics ahead of the interests the better interests of the american public where is that american spirit where is that sense of patriotism where is that sense of responsibility of leadership in this house and in the unitedstates senate that needs to go forward with the american jobs act representative garamendi i know weve been joined by another colleague it is just great to share this hour with you to talk about the progress we can taste that would lift every community in this great nation mr garamendi i was reading one of the hill magazines often called the hill rags and they said that the speaker of this house starts off his weekly press conference by asking where are the jobs well the jobs mr pwalker on dsk7tptvn1prod with house so long overdue and now to taste success and have it pulled away from the american health care consumers of this great nation is a very troubling notion mr garamendi well mr tonko thank you very much next monday did you know next monday is the annual birthday of medicare next monday it went into effect in 1965 and ever since as you said earlier republicans have been trying to terminate it they tried again this year but the american public knows better they know that they want to live long enough to get to medicare because in medicare they have a guaranteed benefit they know that wherever you are in the united states whether you are in vermont or in california you have the same quality policy that will cover most of what you need if you want more you can go out and buy that thats called the advantage program and you get to choose your program its not a government takeover at all in fact it is a financing mechanism so that every senior in america can choose their own provider they get to choose their provider they can go wherever they want to go to get their medical services and if they dont like their doctor they can change so the government is not saying where you can go in fact the government is financing the system so you can choose whatever provider you want to choose it is a common policy across the nation it is efficient and it is effective and the republicans are trying to destroy it we wont let that happen bottom line we will not let that happen and there are serious cost containments in the current medicare program and in the affordable care act im just going to end with this and then we really need to get to what we wanted to talk about which were the job programs the congressional budget office today estimated that the affordable care act over the next 10 years will reduce the deficit by 109 billion in the 20 years going out because of the cost containment in this system the affordable care act will reduce the deficit by over 1 trillion now thats worth engaging thats worth us doing and simultaneously provide far better health care to americans and far better access to health care wherever they may need it across this nation its a good thing when they want to stand up here and say obamacare im going youre right obama cares cares deeply about the very health of every single american thats why the affordable care act is in place today was found to be constitutional does reduce the deficit and does provide quality health care and choice of where you want to get your medical care mr tonko my colleague from california just indicated that there would be a favorable deficit outcome because of the affordable care act speaker were proposed last september by president obama the american jobs act two million jobs minimum could have been created this is one of the great woulda coulda shouldas of our time we could have had people back to work today and in doing so reducing the deficit there are so many different pieces of this the american jobs act are where the jobs are you talked about a piece of it im going to just pick up one more this is one that speaks to the american homes whats going on in the house where we live many of those homes are run down they have problems with insulation or they dont have any insulation at all they leak energy well the president proposed as a piece of the american jobs act that we could provide construction jobs really lowskilled construction jobs in rehabilitating the american homes this is not a new concept this

from 20 22 to some 32 people in the class now this is a serious problem for the teacher making it more difficult to provide the quality teaching thats necessary my daughter is a great teacher my soninlaw is too but its much more difficult the class size has increased by a third the american jobs act would have put 280 000 teachers back into the classroom now if you happen to be a secondgrader and youre not getting what you need to learn then thats going to carry on through the remaining years of your schooling and so 280 000 teachers could have been brought back into the classroom had the american jobs act passed b 2030 mr tonko mr tonko yes they are both significant bits of legislation so its good to interlace the american jobs act and the affordable care act to the 280 000 teachers i think its very easy to state that the human infrastructure in our school systems across this nation are a critical component to quality education that personal relationship of students to teacher the exercise of selfdiscovery who am i what are my gifts what are my talents what are my passions that is exercised in the classroom that is a spirit that prevails its a magic that happens in the

longterm unemployed 8 1 million involuntary parttime workers and marginally attached individuals no longer in the labor force who wanted and were available for work and who looked for a job at some point during the last 12 months and so it becomes obvious that any budget should have at its core jobcreation opportunities so that people can experience this opportunity or this commodity that we call work appearances of an economy poised for growth does little for underserved minorities residing in disinvested communities blighted with high rates of joblessness poorperforming schools poverty and crime indeed the promise of a new day and new hopes are few and far between for poor and lowincome workers generally and returning citizens with barriers to employment in particular indeed over the past decade the poor in america have gotten poorer and of course the wealthy have gotten wealthier those called middle class have been squeezed to the point where theyre teetering and certainly could go in either direction that is up with the right kinds of opportunities and down with the wrong kinds of opportunities i dont believe that we can afford in good conscience to continue to turn a blind eye to census figures and monthly data reports of the economic injustices and suffering being imposed upon a growing number of people moreover we cannot continue to hold a great nation hostage for the sake of a few while millions suffer if were truly going to address the crisis in america and put all americans back to work and reduce poverty we must create a mixture of universal and targeted programs capable of weathering political obstacles the congressional black caucus alternative budget is a means to this end indeed the cbc budget safeguards investment in public education pell grants and transportation vital to equipping minority youth and adults with skill sets so that they can obtain and maintain access to gainful sustainable employment in our everchanging global economy and also by renovating and building new schools and investing an additional 50 billion in transportation and infrastructure in 2013 and 155 billion above the presidents budget over the next decade repairing and building bridges across lakes rivers and streams but also bridges to opportunity the congressional black caucus budget protects the health care safety net programs that have been developed it also protects second chance funding while restoring funding to department of justice programs for citizens who are returning home from jail and prison with serious barriers to employment we hold these truths to be selfevident that if america is to become the america that it has never been but the america that all of us hope for and know that it can be then we would take the principles encased in the congressional black caucus budget and comply those to whatever budgets are ultimately passed so again i want to commend mr scott and i want to thank delegate"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "for a great number of hours today in this chamber there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the affordable care act when we know fully that the chances are slim to move forward and the measure would not be signed into law is it political posturing i believe it is of a grand style theres a pattern being established here theres been an attackoutright attackon social security attempts to privatize the system its been under attack for the last 76 years its been the underpinning that provides stability for working families across this great nation it has been a security piece that has enabled many to have at least assurances that there would be some support in family budgets as they move month to month we know that that measure social security has been dealing with its enemies for a long timesince before it was made a law likewise medicare which came to us in the midsixties enabled our senior community to have its health care needs met provided predictability and stability for retired households enabled people to enjoy a quality of life a better quality of health care we know that before medicare many of those who had retired expected to see their economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing health care when they perhaps could not get that coverage in an insurance context so medicare as we know it today would be undone by the republican majority in this house they would prefer to privatize social security allow us to reach to the financial sector to perhaps see a repeat of what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this past recession where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away trillions lost in the american economy pain and suffering endured by families across this land theyd rather see a voucher system for medicare handing it over to the insurance companies to leave seniors digging deeper into their pockets so the pattern has been established here and now a repeal of the affordable care act before its full implementation before given a chance as we arrive as the last industrialized nation in the world to provide a universal health care coverage program unacceptable progress is struck a decision is rendered by the highest court in the land a conservativeleaning court before the ink is dry on that decision a move to repeal the court spoke it has spoken to america and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a decision rendered that said yes in fact it meets the constitutionality test and so this evening on the eve of the attempts to repeal the affordable care act as it stands is a very telling moment it is one that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo programs that serve our middle class so very well and without a thriving middle class our nation is not prosperous without that thriving middle class theres not purchasing power strong enough to provide the recovery of our economy without a strengthening of our middle class there is not a confidence in the economy a confidence that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base and so the affordable care act is offering promise and hope to millions tens of millions of americans across this land whether youre insured underinsured uninsured all categories will see strengthening because of this measure think of it i represent a large proportion of senior citizens who are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs many dealing with that doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig into their pockets we close that doughnut hole we make more affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well and in some cases to have the medications that keep them alive we deny that opportunity to our nations seniors we deny the respect that we offer we deny the dignity in the equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals that our senior community requires that doughnut hole would have been closed by 2020 further at the other end of the age spectrum many young adults finding it difficult in this recessionand now the recovery periodto gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college are given the opportunity with the affordable care act to remain on their familys policy until the age of 26 therein lies a strong benefit for some 6 6 million young adults denied with the repeal measure denying access and affordability to health care situations how many cases of young adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction that would not forego this opportunity for our nations young adults a strong benefit associated with this package what about those who have a preexisting condition some 17 million children in that category and thats not to account for the many adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions asthma in children diabetes in our senior community being a woman utilized as a preexisting condition an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic core need that we should consider to be truly american another benefit lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in this house and the united states senate and signed into law by this president what about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding time in their lives games played with people and their lives and their recovery hope pulled from working families across this nation because of an insensitivity of this congress a deplorable situation assistance to our small business community now if we profess our small business community to be the economic engine that is part and parcel of our economic comeback our economic springboard then would we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area would we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business community many a majority of those businesses will remind all of us as representatives that they want to provide for their employees they want a productive workforce that means a strong and well workforce and so they see it as a strong investment one however that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating costs 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker coverage they wanted that turned around they wanted a smart approach a businesslike approach a sensitive response they got it with the affordable care act progress denied the small business engine weakened by this sort of neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing social security privatizing social security changing medicare as we know it forever now repealing the affordable care act we see the pattern we see the gross neglect the disrespect for americas middle class her working families so we go forward and we understand that with the opportunities of an exchange small employers our small business community understands that if theyre unable to enter into an exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the rules to sharpen their pencils roll up their sleeves provide the service live within the parameters and allow for the many to enter into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits think of it if 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be impacted with catastrophic illness its devastating an actuarial impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ if those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange a better outcome a different outcome a stronger outcome for the economic recovery of this nation because the gross majority of jobs being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business community and so you know the formula is quite obvious we want a comeback we want that strongest response here from washington for that kick that we endured from a recession that drained us of 8 2 million jobs the best way to do it first of three principles small business provide for the strengthening of small business which the affordable care act does because that small business community has forever been the pulse of american enterprise secondly invest in that entrepreneur the dreamer the mover the shaker it always stretched us since our days of pioneer spirit with the industrial revolution and the westward movement very familiar to the district i represent which is the donor area to the erie canal in upstate new york in the capital region mohawk valley that pioneer spirit exists in our fabric today its our dna invest in the entrepreneur to be the ideas economy kingpin we rely on these wizards to build us sustain us stretch us empower us and then finally invest in a thriving middle class which the affordable care act does it enables us as a middle class community to be bolstered by the confidence the security the stability that has come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and not just deal with illness that will put together efforts to cost contain that will bring people into a structured program so that we can monitor their activities and connect them to a system you know youll hear from some on the floor we dont want to pay for this its going to cost us too much were paying today for the neglect for the consequences of a notsoperfect system status quo will not cut it and so we need to go forward with progressive policies with the soundness of reform with the boldness of transition with the confidence we can instill with the progressiveness of policies that we can draft and so it is a sad note here echoed in this chamber that would attempt to unravel dilute destroy deny the promise we can make to america as i look at this effort for a comeback the containment of health care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control create that better environment in which to grow jobs cultivate a prosperity its important its important for us to understand that it is part of an economic recovery equation but theres also the wisdom of investing in education in higher education again under attack by a system that does not always profess the strength of research and education and patents and discovery we understand that we are in the midst of a global race on innovation clean energy and ideas and high tech to be outstanding competitors to arrive at that race ready to conquer we will need to be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global scene we saw that order of passion we saw that order of investment in the global race on space just decades ago this nation impacted by a sputnik moment dusted off its backside and said never again never again and what was the result together a nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race on space we are going to be that agent that nation that proud people that would stake the american flag on the moon and we won that race because of a commitment because of investment in the soundness of the people of this great country and her business community we embraced research we embraced science we believed in our strength as a people and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the victory where is that like passion today where is that leadership a rather youthful president that led us in the sixties and challenged us in almost replication today finds us interestingly to be challenged by a rather youthful president asking us to enter into the global sweepstakes committing with passion to the cause and so we need that investment in education in higher education and research just today in schenectady new york in the 21st congressional district of new york that im proud to represent we announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing center at that facility of ge ceo jeff immelt traveled for the celebration came to town to announce this wonderful wonderful addition that is america at work with her genius activity thats america determined to win the global race on ideas advanced battery manufacturing the battery the linchpin to so much potential out there to grow domestic supplies of energy to grow jobs as we grow our energy future to reduce the gluttonous dependency on fossilbased fuels oftentimes imported from some of the most unfriendly nations to the united states sending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the battlefield unacceptable there is a better way and this congress knows it we invest in jobs we invest in health care we invest in education we invest in research we do it in a way that promises our best attempt as a nation to generations yet unborn someone was there for us and we need to be there for future generations of americans to provide the sort of cuttingedge opportunity that will spell america at her best i look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but nanotechnology and semiconductor signs chip manufacturing the newly designed 20th congressional district in new york that comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st district that i represent is probably one of the most technology investedin congressional districts in the country it is happening because there is this belief in the worker a belief in the entrepreneur a belief in the small business community a belief in the industrial context of the district and knowing full well that americas needsbe they for the environment or energys sake or business creation job creation business opportunityare inspiring this remarkable progress it requires our moving forward with a plan it requires our moving forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends i see it all the time i see it in energyefficiency programs that produce jobs that enable us to capture waste heat that is part of the energy process enabling us to be much more efficient efforts that enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown much more competitive much more sophisticated we can ill afford to weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international economy the old american spirit the history of this nation replete with those rags to riches scenarios that became the reason and the inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to these shores because the opportunity called the american dream became the prize for which they searched i see it in my own roots the proudest label i carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants their journey gave me great opportunity and it gave my family great opportunity those journeys chased after the american dream we need beginning in this house chamber to reignite the american dream to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people to reach into that american heart and soul that has forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have opportunity and that we will not deny that opportunity that we will strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a generation of americans let us not fail in that attempt let us continue to reach deep into that american spirit at a time when we were challenged and our economy was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources and when we tripped and fell let it be known that in the recovery we were stronger than ever before because of that belief that our best days lay ahead of us the belief that those best days were in the future we moved forward and we dug deep into that american spirit to respond with the respect for americas middle class our middle classall of us in that middle classhave always understood if you play hard if you abide by the rules if you roll up your sleeves and do your best you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success that is america in her most shining moments and that is an economy that we can produce it begins with the soundness of a strong and productive workforce that went through training and retraining that got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that comes with education and to then understand our gifts so that we could share them in the most profound way and then to provide for the wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive so that the conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to a nation that was humbled by its own beginnings where the rightful stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a nation that believed in her people so tonight on this eve of an attempt to repeal the affordable care act let us understand that our budget here in washington our actions with legislation our responsiveness to the needs of the american people are an establishment of our prioritiesa prescription of what we see our future to bea reaching into the heart to say that we are a truly caring lot thats what separates us from other nations it is the uniqueness of america and her greatness the affordable care act is a measurement of not only sound policy it is a statement of a compassionate society that understands its not about oneself that its about neighbors that its about community that its about the great society it has been the history through the decades through the vintages of time that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation to respond to the challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger we owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn let them look at this moment in history american history knowing that america was challenged that she stepped up to the plate and said yes to her people and truly made a difference and allowed people to understand full well that the best days of this great nation

pittsburgh it was named in honor of marie de la roche the first superior of the congregation of the sisters of divine providence originally a college for religious sisters it now educates a diverse group of students from around the world offering highquality educational opportunities that continue to reflect its catholic heritage soon after its founding la roche experienced financial difficulties that threatened the schools existence due to the financial strain the congregation at that time seriously considered permanently closing the college however because of the profound and positive impact the school made on the community in the short time its doors had been opened the students state officials and the community leaders urged the congregation and the schools leadership to continue the mission of the school and to keep the school open thankfully due to the outpouring of support from the community in 1970 the board amended its charter to establish la roche college as an independent coeducational catholic institution which it remains today it also joined with the art institute of pittsburgh and diversified its course offerings expanding the areas of study the college would offer including graphic and interior design programs that are among la roche colleges most popular programs today i was proud to serve on the board of trustees at la roche college it was during my time as a trustee that i had the wonderful opportunity to get to know the late monsignor william kerr who served as la roches president for 12 years it was during his tenure that the college established the pacem in terris institute a scholarship program for outstanding collegeage men and women from conflict and postconflict nations such as rwanda and bosnia the institute allows students to receive an education at la roche college to study leadership and diplomacy in return for their agreement to return to their home country after graduation to help engage in the peace process and rebuild their nations the institute successfully reflects the colleges vision and mission to foster global citizenship that program over the years has created a bond with some countries that is unlike any other institution of higher learning in america it has had students go through the program that have gone back to their home countries and have very successfully become leaders in those countries we are better off as a nation and as a global community because of their work and because of that program which initiated and continues at la roche college it was also during my time on the board of trustees in 2004 that la roche college board of trustees appointed sister candace introcaso as the colleges seventh president sister candace began her career in education at la roche in the late 1980s and its under her leadership that the college has continued to expand its global footprint while placing a renewed focus on serving the needs of those in the pittsburgh region i had the privilege of working closely with sister candace during my time as a trustee and as the congressman who now represents la roche college the future is bright for the college under her continued leadership la roche college improves upon itself year after year it continues to expand its academic offerings with more than 50 undergraduate majors 20 undergraduate minors and three graduate programs for six consecutive years it has been named one of the best northeastern colleges by the princeton review and it fields 12 intercollegiate teams on many occasions my office used their facilities for workshops

has not happened in fact the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 straight months nowthe longest stretch of high unemployment since the great depression the congressional budget office predicts it is going to go even longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive dance software 1 2 million was spent on a train museum 2 million was spent to study ant behavior 762 000 was spent to study improvised musici am not sure what that is but i am sure it is lovely not necessarily deserving of scarce federal resources 300 000 to track weather on other planetsgreat if one lives on another planet not so great if one lives on earth in a country that has accumulated an unprecedented debt exceeding 15 trillion 153 000 for an indoor water park and 712 000 to develop a machinegenerated humor systemin other words a joke machine this big joke is on the american taxpayer unfortunately it is no laughing matter in the last 3 years we have added more than 4 trillion to the national debt we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in our nations history and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit exceeding 1 trillion this week the president submitted a budget that calls for adding 11 trillion in new debt over the next decade his own treasury secretary calls the level of spending unsustainable and it is despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has failed the president has called for additional increases in spending i know the president is a good man i also know he faced a difficult economy when he took office but the president is unwilling to tell the truth to the american people about what lies ahead about some of the challenges we face i think he needs to do so and he needs to acknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can avoid making similar mistakes in the future today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the presidents stimulus rather we must lament a tremendous lost opportunity by this administration to put this country back on the right track over these last 3 years for the sake of future generations i hope it is not too late to change course i suggest the

concealed firearm permit to carry a concealed firearm in any state that issues concealed firearm permits as an avid hunter and outdoorsman and as a lifetime member of the national rifle association i can share with personal experience the frustration of my fellow hunters and outdoorsmen the absurdity of having to know which states recognize visiting permit holders from other states and which states that do not our country should not force its lawabiding citizens to check in their fundamental right to selfdefense at the state line the national righttocarry reciprocity act would clarify this matter by requiring states that allow concealed carry to recognize each others permits similar to how states recognize each others drivers licenses righttocarry laws also help deter crime

exporting terror a decade later irans global threat is greater than eve r we are currently embroiled in a standoff with iran over its pursuit of nuclear capability we find ourselves on the brink of conflict over potential iranian armed interference with oil and other shipments through the strait of hormuz and its persistent threats against israel even prior to 911 hezbollah supported by iran was responsible for more american deaths around the world than any other terrorist organization since 2001 iran has embarked on more direct efforts to harm american interests as evidenced by last years foiled iranianbacked assassination plot against the saudi ambassador to the united states the current state of iranian sanctions clearly has not worked to reduce tehrans threat to global peace thats why we need the enhanced approach this legislation will take in countering efforts by iran to evade the impact of international sanctions h r 1905 as amended tightens reporting on countries violating sanctions on these countries and strengthens measures against those who would aid and abet these disturbers of global peace it also effectively blacklists irans energy sector and anyone doing business with it by preventing iran from repatriating the proceeds from its oil sales this rogue government will be deprived of 80 percent of its hard currency earning and half of the funds used to support its national budget iran has used many tricks to subvert current sanctionsfrom oil for gold swaps to selling energy bonds to other trading and bartering schemes they have been successful because there are governments who care more for making profit from doing business in iran than in preventing threats to world peace international efforts to rein in the nuclear ambitions of iran have been stymied particularly by china despite expressing formal support for united nations security council sanctions against iran since 2005 china has stepped in where other nations have curtailed trade with iran chinas bank of kunlun and the elaf islamic bank in iraq have facilitated transactions worth millions of dollars for iranian banks already under sanctions stronger sanctions will make such unsavory

very much for yielding the underlying legislation represents another attempt by the republicans to gut the clean air act shell oil spent years changing its mind about how it wanted to drill what ship it wanted to use and even which of the arctic seas it planned to drill in they themselves dragged out this process interminably this legislation prevents epa from requiring emissions reductions from all drilling support vessels from icebreakers to the drilling ship itself as part of the air permitting process what that means is thatlisten to this numberup to 98 percent of the total air emissions associated with arctic outer continental shelf drilling could not be regulated by epa under the permitting process so hear that again their bill says that epa cannot regulate 98 percent of the emissions thats not reasonable thats not a compromise thats not balance epa has informed congressman waxman that as part of its permit negotiations shell has actually agreed to add technology to one of its icebreakers to reduce the icebreakers nox emissions by 96 percentto reduce them by 96 percentand particulate emissions reduced by 82 percent shell has already agreed to use a cleaner burning fuel than what would otherwise be required by law shell agreed to take these measures so that it could receive its permit from epa and the net effect of all the measures shell has agreed to take will reduce the nox emissions for the entire drilling project by 72 percent but under this bill epa would no longer have the ability to require or to request measures such as these because the bill says that epa cant require reductions in emissions from mobile sources using its stationary source air permitting authority several weeks ago bob meyers who led epas air office during the bush administration pointed out at the energy and power subcommittee hearing that in fact epa can regulate icebreakers and other support vessels under title ii of the clean air act he said that this is why these mobile sources emissions could be exempted from being regulated as part of the stationary source air permitting process that all sounds so reasonable but what these guys are saying is maybe you shouldnt be regulated as both a mobile source and a stationary source under the clean air act but theres just one problem shells air permit says that all of its icebreakers and other support vessels are foreignflagged so they cant be regulated under title ii of the clean air act in the first place and even if they were american vessels theyre all too old to have been subject to the most stringent clean air act or international emissions requirements so what theyre saying is for all intents and purposes theyre neither mobile nor are they stationary so theyre not regulated at all its like being
