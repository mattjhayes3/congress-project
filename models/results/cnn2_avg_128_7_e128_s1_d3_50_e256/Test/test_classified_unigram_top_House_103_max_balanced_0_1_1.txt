federal government is already 400 billion in the red 1 out of the 3 spent by this congress is borrowed money this bill is an insult because under this bill the 4 1 trillion federal debt will get worse much worse the federal debt is so bad that 1 out of every 5 that the american taxpayer sends to washington goes for nothing but interest payments on a national debt and now the democrats in this

democrats are pushing through this congress and under this bill social security will be raided even more yes social security is being taxed under this bill and the worst insult of all is that the democrats in this house want working families middleclass taxpayers and remember that tax cut they were promised americas senior citizens are going to pay even more taxes the american people should understand that under this bill the democrats will increase taxes on your social security benefits the democrats will tax social security and will tax social security benefits because the democrats in this house cannot control their big spending habits we republicans are opposed to taxing social security on february 10 the house republican study committee and the house republican research committee jointly held a congressional forum on the social security tax we revealed the damage that this bill will do to millions of senior citizens we detailed the unfairness of taxing benefits that average people earn through their lifetime of work just because the democrats in this house cannot say no to the special interest groups it is not only that they are spending money that upsets me it is that it is a payoff to the special interest groups yesterday i inserted in the congressional record the statebystate impact that this tax will have on senior citizens the democrats budget bill is an insult

be turning over in his grave one hundred and thirtytwo years ago today he signed into law the nations first income taxdesigned as a temporary emergency measure to finance the civil war today president clinton is raising taxes to finance his version of a class war of course the administration is not without admirers one master of illusion the great houdini must be smiling down on this chamber today when we blow away the smoke and shatter the mirrors what we get from president clintons taxandspend road show is nowhere near what he claims not the 496 billion in deficit reduction not if we use the cbo numbers because cbo based on their estimates would score it at best at 428 billion in deficit reduction even that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of slower spending growth 4 or 5 years from now and then that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of lower spending in the fourth and fifth years this is the president who said we have all got to use congressional budget office estimates they are the real estimates and we have got to reject accounting gimmicks then he ignored cbos baselines and had his bookkeepers invent their own and counted savings from the 1990 budget agreement twice in order to puff up his deficit reduction numbers and i do not know if that is smoke and mirrors or what but if an accountant on main street did it he probably would go to jail that fact is this package includes about 120 billion in promises of net spending reductions almost all in the third fourth and fifth year 255 billion dollars worth of real net new taxes and user fees and about 53 billion in questionable debt service claims that is what you get when you lay this package against cbos estimates instead of the ones the administration cooked up there will be no net spending cuts in the first year zero and virtually none in the second year this package includes deficit increasing items totaling 62 billion over 5 years this new spending probably seems odd to the american people in a socalled deficit reduction package it is one of the reasons why they are nervous about this bill the largest tax increase in our nations history yes the largest by cbo estimates new taxes in this bill are 275 billion the democrats dispute this and they talk about the 1982 tax act but the cbo scored the 1982 tax act as raising 3214 billion in new taxes instinctively americans know these new tax increases are jobkilling poison for the economy they do not believe for one minute that the democrats tax increases are going to create jobs nor do most of the economists in this country the president claims the vast majority of these taxes will hurt only the rich and that is baloney he must not have read his own bill the socalled rich who are targets for massive retroactive tax increases are the small business men and women who create the vast majority of new jobs heaping higher taxes on those jobs creators translates into fewer jobs for working people perhaps we should remember the socalled luxury tax from the 1990 budget deal it is repealed in this bill because that misguided class warfare scheme backfired and killed the boatbuilding industry try to sock the rich and you drown working men and women simplistic attempts to minimize the impact of the energy tax on american families will not hold water either when the democrats tax transportation they are not just taxing people who pull up to the gas pump they are taxing everything that has to be transported senior citizens are among the hardest hit in this package thanks in particular to increased taxes on their benefits it must make them feel real special to learn that president clintons definition of rich people includes seniors with incomes of just 34 000 and that includes half of their social security benefits now that sounds pretty callous especially since seniors on fixed incomes are the one group of americans for whom lower interest rates serve as a financial curse rather than a blessing yes president clinton would like the american people to believe his own taxes only hurt rich people but with over 40 tax increases and 16 user fees in this package no one should seriously buy that story here is what the taxpayers do understand when he was courting their vote clinton promised the middle class a tax cut now he is raising their taxes he promised to create jobs now he is promising tax increases on employers that will kill jobs he promised 500 billion in deficit reduction he is at least 73 billion short of that at best all of the rate increases in the bill including estate taxes are retroactive to january 1 potentially unconstitutional and the installment payments gimmick for individuals does not change the bottom line he is imposing tax increases on people who have already died i urge my colleagues in the house to reject this bill today let us solve our deficit problem through spending cuts up front not tax increases"],

colleagues to join me in defeating this monstrosity so we can start over on a real deficit reduction plan that will reduce the deficitone that will cut spending and increase jobs in america a couple weeks ago i sent out a constituent newsletter to the people of the fourth congressional district as you might expect a good part of that newsletter was dedicated to the presidents tax bill and the reasons i felt it was bad for the country and the reasons why i opposed it in the original draft of the newsletter i made a couple lighthearted jabs at the presidents tax bill i mentioned that opposition to the bill was growing as more people learned more about it i said people started realizing that bill clintons economic plan is a lot like his haircutits much more vxpensive than it looks i also mentioned that the presidents btu tax was a technical energy termit stands for bill tricked you neither of those remarks was in the final version of my constituent newsletter they were both censored out by the house franking commission the franking commission would not approve the newsletter until i removed these two remarks they said they were too partisan but if this bill passes today and if you vote for this bill today you will not be able to hide behind smoke or mirrors and you will not be able to censor out the truth the btu tax was dropped in conference that is one of the few good things that did happen there but if you vote for this bill today the term btu still applies bill tricked you this is not what bill clinton promised in the election this is not what the american people voted for last november this is nnt even what bill clinton said it was tuesday night in his oval office fireside chat he is smooth and he is slick and he is a great teleprompter performer but regardless of how convincing the president may be this bill is still taxandspend pure and simple it will not cut the deficit it will not create jobs and it will not cut spending and no matter what you say you are not going to be able to hide the tax increases in this bill from the american zeople come next april 15 we treat criminals better than this bill treats taxpayers at least criminals are protected by the constitution from laws passed ex post facto you cannot make an act a crime retroactively and punish someone for it this bill punishes taxpayers for success after the fact all the way back to its amazing a lot of presidents have raised a lot of taxes but mr clinton is the first one who has managed to raise taxes before he was even sworn into office the clinton tax increases that we are voting on today actually go back and raise peoples taxes on income earned before mr clinton was even president i guess we should consider ourselves fortunate he could have made it retroactive even more and tried to tax the money people made when people were still making moneyduring the reagan years before the 1990 tax increase you can run and you can hide but even death is no protection against mr clintons appetite for new taxes like grave robbers in the night this bill raises the estate taxes on people who had the misfortune of dying since january it rips open the coffin and steals the silver dollars from the eyes of the dearly deceased if that is not punitive taxation i dont know what is i am not touching that grave diggers shovel you can hide behind the presidents assurances that this bill only taxes the rich but what about the jobs it destroys do you really think that small businesses the real job creators in this country are going to be able to expand and aire at the same time they are trying to come up with the money to pay their retroactive tax liability most small businesses partnerships and s corporations are taxed as individual income taxpayers and yes some of them are successful enough to be in the category that mr clinton calls the rich they are the folks who do the hiring and growing and who create 80 percent or more of the new jobs in this country by plowing their profits back into their business but if this tax bill passes small business wont be plowing back much they will be paying up new jobsdo not count on it the president is definitely right about one thing the people who do not get those new jobs which are not created because of his tax bill they definitely will not be paying higher taxes they will be unemployed retroactive taxation is not the only inequity here look at the taxes on senior citizens they are not richat least most of them six million social security households are going to be hit with the largest tax increase in the entire bill by having 85 percent of their social security benefits taxed rather than 50 percent the number will go up to 8 million by 1998 and higher every year after as inflation pushes more and more social security recipients over the threshold some 40 000 households in kentucky will be paying 32 million more in taxes because of this one provision and we arent talking about people with incomes over that magic 180 000 level that the president keeps using 57 percent of the taxes generated by the elderly surcharge will come from seniors with incomes under 75 000 even if you hold your nose long enough to get past the punitive retroactive tax increases and elderly surcharges in the bill you are left with one simple factthis bill just will not work it will not reduce the deficit tax increases wont reduce the federal deficit congress has proven this over and over again every time this body raises taxes it just turns around and raises spendings gimmicks like the presidents deficit reduction trust fund will not change that reality the promised spending cuts will not materialize and i have never seen a single economic model which even begins to suggest that you can create prosperity with tax increases it just cannot be done i ask you all to listen to the people for a minute they are sayingand they have been sayingcut spending first this bill does not do that it doesnt cut spending today it raises taxes yesterday it raises taxes today it raises taxes tomorrow but when it comes to spending cuts it only promises it only promises cuts some place down the road at some far off tomorrowa tomorrow that probably will never come we have heard those promises before we heard them in 1990 the taxes are still here but the promised budget cuts never came when i say there are no budget cuts in the bill i am of course speaking in relative terms there are some budget cutsthey are few and far betweenbut even these are phoney and temporary the presidents bill takes a token slap at federal employees cutting manning levels and freezing pay it slashes defense and it cuts reimbursements to doctors and hospitals but the only realistic way to cut federal employment costs over the long run is to improve efficiency or to cut the size of the federal government and to eliminate unnecessary programs as long as the federal government keeps growing we are going to need good qualified people to run those programs temporary employee cutbacks and pay freezes wont do the job but the presidents program doesnt cut back the growth of the government and it doesnt eliminate a single federal program the president does propose slashing defense spending in fact he plans to decimate national defense by cutting 127 billion but is that realistic i dont think so if he tries to cut that much some place along the line he is going to discover he doesnt even have enough aircraft carriers left for photo opportunities if he cuts as much as he proposes from national defense mr clinton is even going to have to ask mike dukakis to return the tank he used in the 1988 campaign and of course i think everybodyif they tell the truthrealizes we cant keep cutting the reimbursement for doctors and hospitals without destroying the quality of health care the savings arent real anyway the costs are just shifted out of the governments budget into the private sector so even the few cuts that are included in the presidents plan are phoney or temporary at best so overall the presidents plan was not improved very much in the conference process it is still a taxandspend bill the cuts are few what cuts there are are phoney and the taxes are very realretroactivejob killers the president would have us believe that he is our nations savior with a plan to heal the sick and raise the dead instead his proposal would sicken the economy and tax the dead it didnt have to be this way the republicans worked hard to come up with a realistic budget alternative that proposed real cuts in real programs but our proposal was frozen out early on the majority never gave it a chance or a second thought maybe if we defeat this bill we could get together and work out a real deficit reduction plan thats what we need to do this bill is not going to do the job you will not be able to hide behind empty promises backroom deals and censorship if this bill is enacted when april 15 comes around people are going to learn the truth it is a tax bill there is no fairness here just taxes i urge my colleagues to join me in defeating this mess"], [4.5869990572100505e-05, 4.5869990572100505e-05, 0, "i want to

democrat majority first pressed for a task force to investigate these charges i said the majority is offering an unacceptable resolution for an unnecessary investigation into unbelievable allegations based on unsubstantiated claims made by unsavory characters now after an 8month investigatlon at a cost to the taxpayers of 4 5 rrlion the october surprise task force conclusively refuted all alegations nde by the proponerls of 1he october surprise conspiracy theory i hate to tell you i told you so but i told you so i belileve now and i have always beleved that thi investigation was not necessary we were told by th majority tvhi there were trowbing llegations those allgatons were not troubling there were preposterous both newsweek and the new republic concluded as much in detailed investigative reports before the democrats even started this committee there is a curious aliceinwondarend logic about all of this first there were a number of october surprise conspiracy theories reported in the media these theories fed off each other repealing the same myths and fentasles in different ways taking unproven assertions and claiming they were undeniable facts quoting dubious sources playing up anything that could damage the reagan campaign team playing down anything that would damage their own case al the sordid ancient ticks of the conspiracy trade but simply by being reported and commented upon in the politcay correct media outlets ihat is the new york tames public television et cetera the conspiracy theories were said by democrats to raihe questions that needed to be answered once that claim was made it was inevitable that a congress dominated by democrats would be asked to provide the answers particularly since it was the antirepublican conspiracy theorists themselves who primarily did the asdng so the house had a costy investigaton based on nothing more than the claim that questions had been raised but questions are raised all the time in the media theories about secret powerful cabals of sinister puppet masters abound why was this particular theory dragged out for so long in the press paid such respectful attention and finally made the subject of two congressional investigations the fact that the questions were raised by disgruntled democratic party partisans shady characters and worldclass international liars was rarely mentioned by democrats when democrats were accused by republicans of partisanship in asking for an investigation based on unproven allegations they held up their hands in pious horror and exclaimed but questions have been raised we must investigate as if they rush to answer all conspiracy theory questions as matter of principle shorn of its sensationalism here is what happened reaganhating political activists and scoundrels concocted a libelous story claiming that ronald reagan or his aides or both deliberately used the hostages for their own political purposes the media reported the story and gave the theorists forums from which to spread the ibel because the story had been reported democrats said there are questions that must be answered and a congressional investigatory committee was formed and funded the theories were as i have said groundless is this going to be the investigative model for our future in the house will the democratic leadership always call for an investigation of conspiracy theories no manner what the source so long as questions are raised will we see democrats rushing to the floor or secretly enlisting the gao to investigate conspiracy theories about president clinton if and when such theories appear if some disgruntled republican who served in the bush administration manages to get a large part of the oped page given to him of the new york times as mr sick dkto offer a wacko conspiracy theory about the president clinton will democrats say questions have been ralsedl and call for an investigation i watch and wait with patient expectation it is also interesting to note the timing of the release of the report i can guarantee you one thing if there had been one bit of evidence that the reaganbush campaign was indeed involved the information would have been on every front page across the nation before the election instead the report concluded that there was no credible evidence of a conspiracy and it was released following the election i commend mr hamilton the very distinguished member from indiana who did a fine job in leading this investigation but lee hamilton should not be forced to waste his valuable time tracking down erroneous outrageous ridiculous allegations he should spend his time on the substantive things he does best things like heading a task force on congressional reform in fact investigations like this should be an item for the joint committee on the organization of the congress we should have better procedures in the house so that we can make certain that we dont form committees to investigate every wild conspiracy theory that hits the halls of congress we should also have a requirement that the minority is always kept informed of gao investigations initiated by the majority we should also prohibit staff from writing to federal judges urging them to release convicted felons from prisons because they proved helpful with secret investigations i appreciate the role that henry hyde both as the republican leader of this task force and as a force for reason during the entire debate i would like to thank him for reminding us all through this special order that the october surprise task force was formed not because the majority wanted to answer troubling questions from credible sources but because there are some who want to cast a shadow on one of the greatest presidents in our history i think the formation of this task force not the work product of the members of that task force symbolizes much to what is wrong with this house after 38 years of majority control"],

should remember george bernard shaws famous quip about second marriages the triumph of hope over experience while i heartily applaud the presidents emphasis on deficit reduction like the famous irish writer i urge my colleagues to focus on experience the problem is the underlying principles of the clinton plan that tax increases will reduce the deficit flies in the face of precedent recent history shows higher taxes lead to more federal spending lower economic growth fewer jobs and ultimately larger deficits we saw budget agreements and this chart reflects those budget agreements that resulted in massive tax increases in 1983 1985 1988 and 1990 in each case you can see from the charts more spending and larger deficits resulted from those tax increases chairman obeys own chart showed us that it was only in the years when congress was forced to restrain spending under the grammrudman act did we see any slowdown in this pace of runaway federal spending and that is reflected in chairman obeys own chart that he has presented us under grammrudman total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 1 1 percent under the 1990 budget agreement with its supposedly stricter than grammrudman spending controls total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 8 4 percent the proof is in the pudding as you can see from this chart here the grammrudman record clearly shows that seriously restraining congress ability to spend is the only real way to achieve progress on the deficit in addition i think it is important to point out actual tax revenues since the 1990 budget deal have fallen by more than 3 25 for every dollar the deal is supposed to raise and the deficit increased from 3 1 percent of gnp in 1990 to 5 percent in 1992 every economic study you look at shows that every dollar in new taxes raised since 1947 has led to 1 59 in new government spending a recent study by citizens agonst government waste showed that the 1990 budget agreement produced 2 37 in new spending for every dollar raised in new taxes that is hardly a formula for real deficit reduction experience shows that excessive government spending not a lack of tax revenues causes massive deficits revenues to the federal government have remained steady at an average of 18 6 percent of gross domestic product between 1965 and 1992 never falling below 17 5 percent at the same time government spending has risen from 17 6 percent of gnp to 23 5 percent in 1992 even more telling tax revenues have grown annually at an 8 percent rate over the past decade but spending has increased at an annual rate of 11 percent during the same time the clinton plan is more of the same with deficits the administration projected to average 250 billion a year and their analysis does not even reflect the blow to the economy of taking 328 billion out of the private sector out of the revenue stream in new taxes 328 billion these new taxes will stifle economic growth destroy jobs reduce revenues and increase the deficit economists across the ideological spectrum are convinced that the clinton tax increases will lead to widespread job loss let us look at a few of their comments david resler of nomura securities puts the cost at 400 000 lost jobs by the end of 1994 from these new tax increases drimcgraw hill says 700 000 jobs will be lost in 1997 and 1998 larry kudlow the chief economist at bear stearns estimates job losses at 3 2 million by 1996 and a reduction in real economic output of 450 billion we are going to have unfortunately i think the votes are there for the huge tax increases and we are going to see the prophecies of these economists realized constricting the economy with higher taxes not only means additional job losses less revenues from taxes higher expenditures for unemployment claims but ultimately larger deficits we all remember the infamous boat tax hike in the 1990 budget agreement that illconceived and shortsighted proposal not only failed to reduce the deficit despite the claims from many that it would do just that but it actually lost revenue the boat tax actually lost revenue because it threw thousands of workers out of their jobs as we now know the government lost the income tax revenues from these workers and increased spending on their unemployment claims the experiences of economies across the globe show that higher taxes and more government lead to longterm economic sluggishness we simply cannot grow the government without seriously stifling the private sector at the same time that the government gets bigger these tax increases stifle the productive private sector and destroy jobs we will not balance the budget or even make a dent in the deficit unless we allow the private sector to operate as the engine of economic growth i hope we can learn something from these economic lessons learned throughout our history economic lessons learned in couptries from mexico to poland but unfortunately lost on many of the politicians in this body when will they learn that free markets less government spending and low taxes are the only solid foundation for real economic growth 1 i urge my colleagues to support real

with the remarks of a fighting commonsense democrat the gentleman from ohio with all the white house has been doing over the last couple of weeks the american people are justified in asking what in blazes is going on with the clinton administration and specifically what is up with his budget while the concern is real the focus may be a little off indeed many things are going up with the clinton budget we are considering today but the worst things about it are what things are going down i want to bring my colleagues attention to both the ups and the downs of the socalled plan needless to say spending is up despite omb director leon panettas comments earlier this year that the administrations budget would contain 2 in spending for every 1 in new taxes this reconciliation bill reverses this plan it actually contains 6 in taxes and fees for every 1 in spending reductions and it is a 20toi ratio over the first 2 years call me a cynic but that is more in line with what some of us expected indeed whether spending reductions will ever occur is open to question but one thing is clear the president and the majority democrats in congress are interested only in paying lip service to spending cuts in its exhaustive search for domestic programs that dont work and are no longer needed the administration came up with only 11 programs totaling less than 3 billion out of the 1 427 trillion in nondefense outlays in 1997 and of the 343 billion this bill contains in reconciled reductions less than 70 billion is not arrived at by higher taxes overall this budget adds nearly 38 billion in new or expanded entitlement programs which have after all been the problem with this budget all along while the administration has been forced into negotiating with congress over entitlement caps little has been said about the entitlement programs the budget creates even though halt a dozen human resources provisions were cut by 1 2 billion over 5 years incredibly 20 other programs were expanded by 1 9 billion creating a spending increase of 700 million so what did the ways and means committee do characteristically it added new taxes including extending the federal unemployment tax which now enjoys permanent status as a temporary tax only in washington the new immunization program is a good example of how the democrats pass up opportunities to reform social services and simply resort to throwing dollars at problems despite evidence that govemmentprovided immunizations will have no impact on the immunization rate the democrats passed on a republican plan to allow states to use rewards and punishments to encourage welfare recipients to immunize their children thereby adding another 2 billion to cost of this bill there is not even a pretense that the regressive energy tax portion of this tax bill will not be used for more spending the white house has stated that the energy tax will help reduce the deficit and put the government on a payasyougo basis for needed public programs thats more spending folks and itis interesting to see how the democrats have tried to hide the taxs regressivity by robbing one class of taxpayers to pay off another this budget spends at least onehalf of the 71 5 billion expected to be raised over 5 years on lowincome families and individuals including printed on recycled paper containing 100 post consumer waste h 2998 c a 28 billion increase in the earned income tax credit eitc 7 billion in additional food stamp payments and 1 billion for lowincome home energy assistance program payments this forces middleincome familieshardly our nations richest taxpayersto pay an excessive share of the administrations revenue goal and as the energy tax increases yearly it is impossible for the middle class to know the size of the bag it is left holding it truly is a stealth tax which brings me to the next item that is up with the clinton budgettaxes all of this increased spending will require passage of the most massive tax hike in history it calls for 332 billion in tax increases over next 5 years and adding the various hidden increases the tax bite will grow even larger in later years it creates a new individual income tax rate brackets at the 36 and 39 6 percent levels which reach even lower down the income scale than now these new tax rates are supposed to raise 31 billion of the 39 billion in deficit reduction for 1994 under this plan gone at least from this reconciliation bill is all pretense of a millionaire surtax the white house no longer pretends that it is anything more than another rate bracket with millionaires defined now as those earning more than 250 000 and of course this tax is retroactive to the beginning of 1993 even families with incomes under 20 000 contrary to the presidents claims will bear the burden every time they pay their heating bills fill their gas tanks of make a purchase of almost any kind the clinton energy tax alone will cost every american family 471 a year individuals with adjusted gross incomes over 150 000 who pay estimated taxes must under the clinton budget pay 110 percent of current year taxes as next years estimated taxes to qualify for a safe harbor so individuals with no increase in income or tax liability during that year are effectually giving the government an interestfree loan this is outrageous but it is even worse for corporations even though this bill sets the maximum corporate tax rate at 35 percent large corporations which pay estimated taxes must pay a full 100 percent estimation rather than the 97 percent under current law this reduces the margin of error in computing estimated taxes and virtually assures the assessment of penalties the administration hopes to gain 2 7 billion from this unfair illusory deficit reduction provision which will only speed up the payment of corporate taxes by a few months and make a cheap profit from hardtofollow rules which are broken there is a hidden rate bracket increase in this reconciliation bill on small businesses and family farms the biggest job creators throughout the 1980s the bill would phaseout the permanent personal exemption limiting itemized deductions and

possible challenges i must inform you and everyone else that the delegate vote issue is not the issue foremost in the minds of the people of guam for we have a concern with an issue more fundamental

united states the legislaton maintains the relationship between guam and the united states yet allows guam to have more control over its domestic affairs some of you might ask what is wrong with the current relationship between guam and the federal government nothing unless you believe that the ending of the cold war and the development of the new world order signal a reevaluation of the relationship between guam and the federal government nothing unless you believe that the relationship should be a partnership between guam and the united states nothing unless you believe that the citizens of guam should have the right to determine how they should be governed guam is currently an unincorporated territory an unincorporated territory means that first laws can be imposed upon the people of guam without consultation second any local law can be abrogated by the unitedstates congress third unitedstates citizenship can be taken away from the people of guam fourth guam can be bought sold or traded by the federal government and ffth guam as a territory is in the truest sense a possession h r 1521 proposes restructuring the fundamental political relationship between guam and the federal government to a partnership which recognizes the mutual interests of both parties this new partnership will not affect guams role as a strategic outpost of the military in the western pacific the federal government should and will maintain defense authority in guam if commonwealth status is successful the only difference is that under commonwealth there will be an enhanced sensitivity to guams land needs and planning h r 1521 recognizes guams strategic role and continued reliance upon the united states for its defense and the act acknowledges that defense and foreign affairs are unique federal responsibilities some of you might ask why are the people of guam seeldng commonwealth status why not remain a territory as a territory guam has all of these tax benefits guam desires stability and some control over its status this reminds me of a man who asks his girlfriend why be maried when you are getting all of the benefits without the responslblities of mardage just be happy with the benefits you are getting the people of guam desire stability and control over its status some of you might ask why commonweath status why not statehood why not independence why not free association the voters of guam have made that determination in january 1982 two plebiscites were conducted to give the voters of guam the chance to choose the future political direction of guam the options included status quo statehood incorporation commonwealth independence and free association in the first plebiscite 49 percent of those voting chose the commonwealth option 26 percent chose statehood 10 percent chose keeping the status quo only 5 percent of the voters selected incorporated status while 4 percent opted for independence and 4 percent opted for free association independence later that year a runoff plebiscite was held between statehood and commonwealth choices this vote attracted over 81 percent of the voters an overwhelming 73 percent of these voters supported commonwealth status the voters chose commonwealth status it is believed because it was considered to be the most pragmatic and attainable of the options thus the philosophy of the commonwealth act is to structure a better relationship with the united states a relationship tailored to meet the unique circumstances that exist on guam a relationship tailored to meet the growing aspirations of the people of guam for greater seifsufficlency a relationship tailored to provide a more balanced partnership between guam and the united states besides establishing a partnership

pennsylvania in 1925 and upon graduation applied to the state law school in baltimore however because of the segregated time in which he grew up thurgood marshall was not admitted because of the color of his skin as a result he registered at howard university law school whereupon he graduated at the top of his class in 1933 and began a solo law practice in baltimore during the depths of the depression with an undying passion in his heart for justice and equality for all justice marshall was selected as general counsel to the naacp legal defense fund in 1936 where for 25 years he traveled throughout the nation representing the interests of black citizens who were systematically denied their constitutional rights provided in the constitution itself thurgood marshall made it his life ambition to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination he fought hard to protect individual and minority rights one of marshalls most important victories occurred in 1954 when he successfully argued before the supreme court the school desegregation case brown v board of education the court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal justice marshall also valiantly represented the black students vho sought to gain entry to central high school in little rock ar he also fought to protect the civil rights of many of the students who staged lunch counter sitins and integrated the southern bus lines in freedom rides justice marshalls fervent dedication to and belief in the constitution of the united states gained the attention of more than just a few then president john f kennedy appointed him to the unitedstates second circuit court of appeals in new york in 1961 four years later former president lyndon b johnson nominated him for the position of

against entrenched tradition and archaic laws that validated segregation in america mr marshalls rich experience as a civil rights advocate was expanded by his subsequent service as a judge of the unitedstates court of appeals for the second circuit and as unitedstates solicitor general few of the 4istinguished judsts who have ever served as justices brought to the court the wide experience and brilliant achievements of the first africanamerican appointed to the unitedstates supreme court by the time of his appointment he held an unequaled record of victories in arguments before the supreme court specifically thurgood marshall won 29 of 32 cases he argued before the highest court in the land for the hopeless and the helpless masses of unrepresented and underrepresented american citizens this rock of justice became widely recognized and respected for his efforts in bringing about the landmark decision in 1954 in brown versus board of education which rendered separate but equal education unconstitutional however we are reminded by the honorable robert l carter senior judge in the unitedstates district court for the southern district of new york and a friend and former colleague of thurgood marshall at the naacp that mr marshalls contribution to civil rights jurisprudence far extended his nofeworthy efforts in the area of school desegregation judge carter stated in an opinioneditorial in the wake of his friends death although thurgood is always credited for his efforts in school desegregation we were involved in cases striking at segregation in inter and intrastate commerce and in housing indeed he was involved in all aspects of discrimination against blacks in the united states when i joined the staff thurgood was taking cases of black servicemen who were being treated in a discriminatory manner by the military he handled a number of criminal cases he took en cases of police brutality and of course he followed up on his victory before the supreme court in smith versus allwright by seeking to secure the rights of blacks to vote in prlmaries throughout the south washington post jan 26 1993 a17 on the court justice thurgood continued to champion the cause of civil rights and individual rights for all americans his greatness as a lawyer and commitment to the highest ideals of the unitedstates constitution shone through an indifferent and sometimes hostile judicial system to engender equal justice under the law we are all poorer by his absence from the legal landscape but richer by his living legacy as we look to the future remembering his past achievements and recognizing that there are presently too few role models for our youth we should hope that generations unborn will possess an even greater appreciation of mr civil rights"],

follow the same intelligent path as it weighs the funding demands of major government programs particularly health care the reason higher beer taxes should be avoided has nothing to do with politics using such taxes to fund ongoing government programs is not smart budgeting because it simply doesnt work all we need to do is look toward the states to discover the growing inefficiencies of beer excise taxes last year the council of state governments called these socalled sin taxes a wom out tax source the council advised states to look for more stable revenues to fund vital programs such as health care and education the council is not alone in its contention that revenue for important social programs should not come from unreliable sources such as beer taxes other widely respected organizations including the federation of tax administrators and the national council of state legislators agree that the excise tax piggy bank has been raided too often the federal government should heed these omens and leave beer taxes off the table once and for all when searching for health care funding vehicles funding for any major social program especially national health care should not fall unduly upon the shoulders of beer consumers or any other single group tax fairness is a timehonored principle in our country and during the past few years responsible beer consumers have shelled out more than their fair share when the federal beer excise tax was doubled in 1991 moderate drinkersnot chronic abusers reduced their consumption not only did this prove beer taxes to be a shaky revenue generator but it also punished 84 million hardworking middle class americans whose only offense was purchasing a perfectly legal adult consumer product the minority of drinkers who abuse alcohol are not put off by higher costs they have serious problems which can only be cured through education and tougher law enforcement not excessive taxation punishing the many for the irresponsible behavior of the few is not just a bad idea its bad public policy period access to quality health care is a vital issue of our times but implementing a regressive tax to fund a program for every american doesnt jibe with common sense our task in congress is clear any health care program up for consideration must include reasonable funding mechanisms ones that do not gamble with peoples

crossed the country speaking out at abolition rallies in 1947 when he joined the brooklyn dodgers jackie robinson became the first africanamerican to play majorleague baseball jackie distinguished himself as one of baseballs ailtime greats by compiling a long list of accomplishments including rookie of the year in 1947 most valuable player in the national league in 1949 and a lifetime 311 batting average most importantly his entrance into the game paved the way for other africanamerican players to play major league baseball in 1962 he was inducted into the baseball hall of fame as we celebrate the accomplishments of africanamericans this month it is important to realize that what africanamericans have ac complished should not solely be heralded in relation to race this celebration should not only highlight accomplishments of africanamericans it should make clear the vital importance that these accomplishments have made to american society as a whole in a time when the basic

may be heard on this point of order again i think the congress should be well aware that we have indeed already acted on this issue before the aviation safety and capacity extension act of 1990 to which the gentleman from minnesota referred did establish a new type of facility charge program that permitted airports to impose charges of up to 12 per round trip on passengers traveling on scheduled airlines the statute specifies that airlines shall collect this charge from paying passengers nevertheless pfc regulations promulgated by the faa did not incorporate the term we in congress used paying passengers which was used in that law but used instead an entirely different a term not a word of art certainly but one that they called passenger emplaned and the regulations definition of the latter term references made to revenue passenger which is a far more ambiguous term than paying passengers that departure from the precise language of the law has incorrectly exposed an entire category of passengers to the statutorily unauthorized collection of pfcs in the last congress i offered language which the committee on appropriations accepted and which this congress passed and it became law that prohibited the faa from using any appropriated funds to plan or execute any rule to add the cost of pfcs to frequentflier tickets as you know those are the ones that oftentimes are

normandy beaches in france that day operations overseas immediately became known as dday even though in military parlance there have been many other ddays before and since in the public mind however june 6 1944 is and always will be the only dday it is easy from a vantage point of 50 years in the future to underestimate the success of our forces on that june day in retrospect the success of the normandy invasion as well as the final defeat of nazi germany within the following 11 months seems preordained and inevitable however we must never forget that at the time the normandy invasion was far from a guaranteed success and were it not for a combination of skilled planning valor and just plain luck the success of dday could readily have gone the other way throughout world war ii the carnage and waste of world war i were never far out of the minds of the governmental and military leadershipand of our fighting forces world war i we must remember was fought less than 30 years prior to dday virtually every soldier in the foxhole every sailor at sea had heard stories from their own fathers from other world war i veterans from motion pictures and books and from their own commanding officers about how it was common during that earlier conflict to expend a loss of thousands upon thousands of casualties to gain a few square yards of land they were all familiar with the static trench warfare of 1914 to 1918 during which a generation of european youth was killed off or maimed without any significant change in the location of the fighting front they were well aware that world war i was a bloody stalemate with an unprecedented loss of life and which resulted only in the rise of naziism and a renewed conflict within a generation they did not want this to happen again at the time of dday the allies were under tremendous pressure from the kremlin to initiate an invasion of western europe to relieve the brunt of military combat which the russian army was absorbing on the eastern front many wellmeaning american citizens british subjects and french freedom fighters joined in this call for a western front both the government and the military resisted this pressure roosevelt and churchill as well as generals marshall and eisenhower well remembered the carnage of 19141918 they did not want the wholesale slaughter to be repeated nor would they countenance a return to the bloody and fruitless trench warfare of world war i they determined that france would not be invaded from the west until the allies were guaranteed overwhelming military superioritydespite the entreaties of the soviet union the mastermind of dday was one of the military giants of all time dwight d eisenhower it was ike who supervised the accumulation of materiel in britain who made the decision which beaches would be the most productive to invade and made the final decision on the date gen ike eisenhower had the personality the charisma and the leadership capabilities to take the often diverse and divergent military leadership of the various allied nations and mold them into a united efficient fighting machine we all know that ike deserves the credit for the incredible success which resulted from the gamble on dday few americans realize however that ike was prepared to take the sole blame if the invasion proved a failure he had in fact prepared a press release in which he contended that the failure of dday was the result of his own miscalculations and that no one should be blamed other than he as we all know that press release was never issued and in fact its existence was unknown until after general eisenhowers death originally dday was supposed to take place on june 5 weather conditions prohibited this and the forecasts predicted june 6 would not be much better however if the invasion did not take place at this time it would be many weeks before the tidal conditions were right for an invasion of this nature and eisenhower was convinced that his security could not remain tight and that the secret of the invasion would be leaked if postponed again so ike took a gamble that the weather would hold on june 6 long enough for sufficient forces to secure the shore we all know what happened next the names of normandy beaches will be emblazoned in all of our histories as long as valor and dedication are honored but so much could have gone wrong on that june morning 50 year ago if the weather did not hold out if the germans had taken the invasion seriously and counterattacked immediately if roosevelt and churchill had caved in to stalin and authorized the invasion before our forces were ready if hitler had authorized the development of v1 and v2 missile rockets and other military hardware earlierif any of these thing had gone differently we may well not be here today saluting the bravery and valor of dday but thanks to our superior military leadership and the incredible gallantry of american and allied soldiers sailors and pilots dday is a glorious day a day when the ideals of liberty and justice were guaranteed to western europe and in fact because the wave of the future for the rest of the world it is fitting that we adopt this resolution so that future generations can be reminded of what dday should mean to us all i withdraw my reservation of objection"]]}
