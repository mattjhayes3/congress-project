{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise in support of the fauntroy substitute the congressional black caucus once again has presented an alternative budget plan that offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [5.960464477539062e-07, 0.9999994039535522, 1, "first of all i would like to commend congressman wyche fowler for providing the time for this much needed discussion of a very critical issue the slaying of over 20 children in atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty injustice and other societal ills which cloud any efforts to provide equal opportunities for each and every citizen e"],

was also a major participant in the house impeachment proceedings during the judiciary committees review of watergate during these hearings george became prominent in his role in developing meticulous legal points regarding violations of the law and constitution since he had such a keen mastery of the law he was an extremely valuable participant and was very strong on relevant questioning of witnesses during the impeachment proceedings georges marvelous sense of humor and penchant for colorful quotes to the local and national press became apparent for example during a heated interrogation of an evasive watergate witness george was widely quoted for his comment that eliciting a response was like trying to nail a drop of water to the wall while undergoing more serious questioning of another watergate witness george demonstrated his great talent for thinking on his feet and quickly getting to the point at that time president nixons counsel protested that the impeachment hearings were damaging to the presidency george replied that only the president can damage the office of the president what we are doing is protecting the office of the president during his service in the house george has achieved numerous legislative victories these include the ethics in governnlient act copyright reform bankruptcy legislation and his involvement in performers royalties legislation additionally george has been a key leader in numerous administrative procedures legislation dealing with the improved functioning of government additionally many of us are well aware of his exceptional performance as presiding officer in the house speaker oneill frequently calls upon george to preside over this body and we have all noted georges fair and efficient manner in conducting this important duty numerous press accounts have referred to george as a workhorse a trait that all of us who have been privileged to work with him have noted repeatedly george spends tremendous energy and time on hi legislative and constituent duties and has justly received many accolades for his efforts just recently for example president reagan signed into law legislation which previously had appeared before georges subcommittee on administrative law and governmental relations this federal tort claims measure was signed hito law in december of last year and when presenting george with

receive a quic reagan veto one of georges endeavors in the congress has been is personal and dedicated interest in the analyses of house rolleall votes after undertaking an extensive review over a 4year time period george concluded in a comprehensive report that the house was being inundated with unnecessary rollcalls resulting in a waste of house time and taxpayers money this report which was the subject of a syndicated column appearing in newsday and numerous newspapers received w de praise a brief reference accompanying the newsday article referred to george as follows george danielson brings both expertise and a sense of humor to his critiques as a result of his efforts georges report led to improved rules changes in house rollcalls it is clear to all of his colleagues his

business of the congress to speak on a matter which i consider to be of the utmost importance as it pertains to a community within our country a group of americans who we can approximate as between 7 million and 8 million who reside in the united states itself and on the island of puerto rico last week while speaking in dallas tex the chairman of the private sector survey on cost control mr j peter grace speaking before the american feed grain manufacturers association and this statement came over the wire services the united press wire that we have back behind your desk at approximately 4 37 on thursday may 27 mr j peter grace in dallas tex the head of this organization whose official title is the private sector survey on cost control but is really a government spendingwatchdog committee said thatthere are presently 900 000 puerto ricans who live in the city of new york and they are all on food stamps he went on to say that 2 1 million puerto ricans were living on the mainland but then went on to also talk about the puerto ricans who live in puerto rico and stating thatthe food stamp program is basically a subsidy program for the puerto ricans i take offense with that because both you and i know that poverty is no joke yes there are many persons in this country 2q million to be exact who today are forced to use food stamps as a way of life most of these people if not all of these people prefer not to have a handout what they prefer is to find a mechanism by which we can give them a handup mr grace has since stated in the new york times and in several periodicals of course that have come out in various parts of the nation that he made an oratorical mistake and that lie apologizes for making that oratorical mistake an oratorical mistake may be one thing but a slip is yet something else this is not the first time that the poor of this nation have been faced with an insensitive person at the helm talking about making certain that the private sector and the trickledown theory can function and that we should be much more sensitive toward following that road and that example my feeling about that is as the chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus and as a proud puerto rican a person who was born in the city i represent the city of new york but of two parents who arrived in new york just as many other people have arrived just looking for a better way of life andtrying to raise a family to make certain that we all had our education mr grace was born in a totally different atmosphere he was born in an atmosphere of polo ponies and private clubs there is a big difference between the world from which he comes and the world from which so many puerto ricans come from we have refused to accept his apology because the only apology we will accept is if and when mr grace steps down from that position as the head of this government watchdog committee it seems to me that those who may understand the words oratorical mistake may compare it to what we call a poets license or poetic license in which a poet has discretion to write words as he sees fit to make the poem a complete poem and to be able to have that poem interpreted he does not have a poetic license and my sense of what he said was that those statements would never have been made had they been made before the american grain association who was having their meeting or their convention let us say in the city of new york why should he pick dallas why should he pick dallas to make those statements because he probably felt secure that in the city of dallas because there were no puerto ricans or very few to speak of that it would not be picked up it was picked up by the press and it was sent out throughout the country both myself and my colleague

finds itself in as a result of the illadvised actions taken last year in adopting the presidents budget and tax programs one article by robert j gordon appeared in the washington post for sunday february 28 the writer a professor of economics at northwestern university sketches out what might now be the state of the economy if a different approach one based on objective economic analysis instead of a rigid ideology had been adopted last year one need not agree and i do not agree with all of professor gordons specific suggestions to recognize the cogency of his overall appraisal and the soundness of some of his specifics the latter include especially gradual reform of taxes emphasizing productivity and saving incentives more federal support for education especially technical and vocational education and improving defense preparedness at lower cost by eliminating wasteful practices and unnecessary weapons like the b1 bomber his commentary on the administra tions economic programs he himself aptly summarizes astfollows reaganomics seems stunningly misdirected in almost every aspect from its caveman monetary policy to its goldplated defense budget fo its disregard for the longrun payoffs of training and education we still await the new broom of a politican who will sweep away the liberal and conservative dogmas of the past as well as the damage inflicted in 198182 the other article by walter w heller containing some practical recommendations for action this year appeared in the wall street journal of february 25 professor heller former chairman of the council of economic advisers under presidents kennedy and johnson and now a professor of eco mics at the university of minnesoft is generally credited with the successful tax and budget policies that led to the rapid economic growth low inflation and low unemployment rates of the early 1960s citing projections showing that the deficit trap is far greater than tlhe reagan budget would have us believe mr heller states reaganomics is caught in a nowin trap while denying any rift with the fed mr reagan wont give an inch on the rapid military buildup and gigantic tax cuts that will put deficits into a tripledigit orbit for years to come but unless these menacing deficits are brought within bounds mr volcker wont give an inch on a supertight money policy that will prolong recession stunt growth and abort recovery yet there is simply no way withinthe bounds of political tolerance or human decency to cut the 198386 deficits down to size via further assuits on social programs the truly sad thing about mr reagans budget standhis stonewalling that masquerades as steadfastnessis that a strategically plausible economicaliy positive and politically palatable alternative lies within his reach professor heller then proceeds to outline the steps he believes the president should take as follows announce that he recognizes that his tax budget and defense programs are trying to do too much too soon convene a summit economic disarmament conference among the white house congress and the fed to hammer out an agreed agenda to end the recession promote sustained growth and curb inflation the centerpiece of the accord would consi t of two parts first agreement by the white house to slow the tax cuts and the defense buildup for 1983 and beyond while continuing to make carefully targeted cuts in nondefense spendingheller would however accelerate the 1982 tax cuts and second a firm bargain with the fed under which the fed in exchange for the deficit cutbacks it has been demanding would agree to accommodate expansion by lowering real interest rates a presidential appeal to big business and big labor to moderate their wage and price behavior in exchange for the improved job and profit opportunities generated by lower interest rates and more rapid expansion i agree with professor heller that it is hard to see anything but winners from such a program as a democrat who puts the country above the party as i believe most of us do i would rejoice if such action were taken by the president to reversing the vicious cycle of recession unemployment and inflation we find ourselves in however if he declines to provide such leadership then it must come from congress itself clearly the time is at hand to put aside ideology and partisanship and pull together for the sake of our country the full text of the two articles follows these remarks a way out of the nations economic trap by walter w heller reaganomics is caught in a nowin trap while denying any rift with the fed mr

bounds mr volcker wont give an inch on a supertight money policy that will prolong recession stunt growth and abort recovery yet there is simply no way within the bounds of political tolerance or human decency to cut the 198386 deficits down to size via further as saults on social programs to see just how unyielding a trap were caught in one must appraise the true size of the deficit problem that mr reagan and congress have to surmount to head mr volcker off at the gap the basic raw materials for drawing up a best bet deficit profile are the two official budgets just issued the congressional budget office cbo baseline budget which projects receipts and outlays under existing policies that is before any further spending cuts or tax increases the reagan budget which proposes sharp civilian budget cuts and modest tax incrqases and projects markedly lower interest costs and a faster defense buildup than the cbo budget the accompanying table gives a birdseye view of the two budgets and then offers a modified reagan budget constructed on the following best bet assumptions"], [2.8014183044433594e-05, 0.9999719858169556, 1, "i would only allude to a few comments admiral laroche of the center for defense information quoted lord mountbatten the brilliant british military person who said in 1979 i have come to the conclusion that nuclear weapons are not military weapons because nuclear weapons cannot be used and the danger that imperils humankind on the face of this earth is the perception the illusion that nuclear weapons can be used to me this was an eloquent and powerful statement that nuclear weapons are never to be used but only for deterrence but the supporting documents for this military budget fiscal year 1983 say we must have the capacity to fight to survive and win a nuclear war anyone who believes we can fight survive and win a nuclear war bydefinition with all due respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility who said as i look at the united states and the soviet union and their nuclear arms race i think of two men and i think that is appropriate because it is very sexist and macho to play war gamestwo men in a room locked tight up to their throats in gasoline one standing there with 10 matches and the other standing there with 7 matches and they are both arguing over whether they need 15 matches apiece before they can agree not to strike 1 match in that room that is where we are that is precisely where this arms race is millions of the american people are beginning to awaken to the reality that nuclear war is insanity bloated wasteful and unnecessary military budgets are not in our best interests finally my colleagues are talking about a 5percent addon for fiscal year 1983 military budget as if these numbers make some sense the point is that fiscal year 1982 was an incredibly high base in fiscal year 1981 the military budget in budget authority terms was 173 billion in fiscal year 1982 it went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent increase in 2 years the aspin budget in 2 years calls for a 31 3percent increase the latta budget 33 4percent increase in the military budget in 2 years the obey budget 30 6 percent and even this socalled radical document known as the congressional black caucus that budget is still 25 percent over and above fiscal year 1981 a 12 5 average increase in 2 years so yoticannot tell me or any other rational human being that we are not pouring an incredible amount of money in our military budget in conclusion i would simply say think analyze

is exactly the point i was trying to make we are damaging our ability to have a strong defense by putting all this emphasis and huge expenditure into nuclear weapons in fact we are denuding not only our colleges and universities of professors in the sciences and engineering we are also at the present time already without this huge buildup creating shortages through our defense program in our industrial base on which we depend to produce weapons and on which we ri pend to try to keep an industrial base that can support a sound defense we are even injuring the military itself because so much of the military budget is going into nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery systems that we have not got adequate funds to be able to strengthen our conventional force to train our personnel so that they can operate the military equipment we were embarrassed not too long ago by having an initiative to try to recaputure our iranian hostages which went bad because we could not keep the helicopters flying i think increasingly we are going to see this with tle sophisticated technology we have ve have to give greater incentives to get qualified people into the military and to keep them in the military i have advocated a program which would give educational benefits very much like we do now at west point and the other military academies in return for people having an obligation of service for a period of time and obviously there is that critical need but we have not got money enough for that now i think from every aspect we are undermining our security by proposing to spend these trillions of dollars in nuclear weaponry there is another aspect of this that i would like to emphasize and then i will put the rest of my remarks in the record and that is the question of proliferation that also endangers our future and the future destruction of humanity i am very disturbed indeed that this administration is dropping the efforts that have been put together by all previous administrations republican and democratic to keep a curb on the weapons gaining capability of other countries who are not already nuclear weapons countries i think we need much greater effort internationally and in our own domain to end a fast growing proliferation which in many ways in more dangerous than the nuclear weapons race between ourselves and the russians i think it is highly unlikely that the russians are going to drop bombs on us knowing that they would be committing suicide in doing so they would be destroyed but if we allow reprocessing and enrichment in breeder technology to go around the world with plutonium and highly enriched uranium therefore very greatly available and not subject to effective controls we run the risk that a quadhafi in libya or an araot in the palestinian liberation organization or the red brigades in italy will gain control of a nuclear weapon and might be able to blackmail the world or anybody else and what is our response if the red brigades get a nuclear weapon you do not blow up italy the only real response is to assure that irre sponsible powers of that sort do not get access to nuclear weapons and nuclear materials from which weapons can readily be made today and yet this administration is not only dropping the previous administrations resistance to the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities the sale of reprocessing and enrichment and highly enriched uranium and breeder reactors abroad but we understand it is even being seriously considered that we would start selling reprocessed and enrichment material and equipment abroad ourselves and that we are even contemplating contaminating our civilian nuclear program by turning over spent fuel to be used for the production of weapons by our military forces i would like to say that if we proceed on that road i think we run just totally unacceptable risks that instead we ought to be calling an urgent international conference of nuclear weapons nations to try to restrict the further proliferation of nuclear weaponsmaking capability and the spread of plutonium and highly enriched uranium from which bombs can be made we ought to set up some kind of an international mechanism to assure countries that using fission reactors they would have an assured supply of lowenriched uranium we ought to put a tremendous effort into technology that the united states has developed to extend the lifetime and the burnup capability of existing fission reactors to do what we can to prohibit the sale to any other countries of the machines or the actual materials from which bombs can be made i think that this debate is exceedingly important again i congratulate its sponsors i am happy to take part in it to lend whatever efforts i can to have us stop saying nuclear policy overall and nuclear weapons policy in particular the reagan administrations stand accelerating the nuclear arms race is the crowning glory of a myriad of senseless destabilizing and dangerous policies it is thus especially gratifying to see so many americans finally rise up against this huge senseless nuclear arms buildup with its socalled tactical nuclear weapons neutron bombs and winnable nuclear wars and resist the administrations policies which are leading us on a course toward unprecedented nuclear calamity president reagan has initiated the most massive buildup of nuclear weapons in unitedstates history and on top of that an equally risky foray into develoying a new generation of chemical warfare weapons yet it has not even defined a coherent military or foreign policy the administration is planning a 6year 222 billion expansion of nuclear forces invulving land sea and airbased missiles space weaponry civil defense systems and more in the next decade reagans policies would add 17 000 new nuclear weapons to the 30 000 already existing in the unitedstates nuclear arsenal the stated purpose of this policy is to achieve the capacity to fight and win a nuclear wara goal as unattainable as it is dangerous the administration defends its buildup by claiming that we are vulnerable to the soviets in response to our repeated calls for priority efforts to control the development testing and deployment of nuclear weapons the administration has used distortions and inaccuracies to portray our present nuclear capability as inferior to the russians there is only one important fact in this equation howeverit is not comparability that matters but sufficiencyand we clearly have sufficient nuclear powerin fact the unitedstates has far more power than needed to destroy russia should it attackand russia knows it that is what mattersnot whethler we outnumber the russians or they us in particular weapons system even using the administrations comparisons however the united states and the soviet union are in rough parity today each possessing advantages and disadvantages in its nuclear weapons capability for example the united states leads the soviets by 9 400 deliverable strategic nuclear warheads to 7 800 according to the center for defense information moreover our warheads are more survivable because of more diverse unitedstates strategic force deployments despite the clear sufficiency and even advantage in strategic nuclear warheads possessed by the united states the administration has argued that the soviets are at an advantage in nuclear megatonnage but as paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency said in a recent interview which appeared in the new york times the fact that they might have a 2megaton warhead compared to our modest ones of something like 400 000 tons of tnt only makes one difference how big is the hole going to be where the high school used to be h 1260 again though all these comparisons are irrelevant we have more then enough power for our security already despite the incredible redundancy of nuclear weapons the reagan administration wants to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars to fuel the arms race paralyzing our nations 1 the administrations continued development of more sophisticated nuclear weapons and delivery systems on this massive scale has created the impression that the united states is building a nuclear force to destroy the soviet unions nuclear arsenal in a preemptive attack as the united states and russia approach preemptive capabilities we both become much less secure requiring hairtrigger launch on warning policies enormous amounts of money will be spent and we will be less secure than ever as the military budget is absorbed by destabilizing nuclear weaponry really needed expenditures are denied for conventional forces spare parts improved pay and technical training for our military personnel we deny our soldiers sufficient education and training necessary to understand the tenets of military strategy and even how to operate the sophisticated weapons to which we entrust our national security thus again we will be less secure ever but the nuclear arms race is not the only problem risking nuclear destruction of humanity we need not only a freeze on nuclear weapons development but on the transfer of the materials and equipment for producing nuclear weapons the development of nuclear power on an international scale also carries with it the risk of increasing the number of countries that will have access to the technology and the materials for nuclear weapons specifically nuclear e richment and reprocessing facilities and breeder reactors are direct sources of bombquality materialshighly enriched uranium235 and plutonium if countries decide to use these facilities to develop nuclear weapons the rate of nuclear proliferation could increase and with it the chance of a provoked nuclear war or nuclear blackmail by terrorists against which there is no defense while we can deter russia from nuclear war by making it suicidal there would be no adequate response if a qadhafi or an araffat gains access to a nuclear bomb the only realistic recourse is to prevent terrorists from gaining access to weapons during the past decade the united states has expressed increasing concern over the proliferation risk assocated with nuclear power i one of the great ironies of reagans policies is that they will leave us much weakerweaker because of diversion of funds from our economly weaker because of the established nature of our nuclear investment and weaker because the billion to be spent on nuclear weapons will deprived our conventional military adequacy by 1985 25 nonweapon countries will have operational power reactors each generating enough spent fuel to manufacture a score of bombs annually if the plutonium is separated from the fuel more important some of these countries plan to build reprocessing facilities that will enable them to separate the plutonium from spent fuel once separated the plutonium could be put to weapons use quickly other countries have or are building enrichment plants that could be used to enrich uranium235 to bomb grade levels the reagan administration would greatly exacerbate this problem by condoning even promoting the intro duction and use of these sensitive nuclear technologies and materials on a commercial scale throughout the world once introduced they would be impossible to safeguard effectively providing too easy access to any terrorist group and nuclear weapons ca pability to countries that might use them for blackmail or in local conflicts if they got pressed to the wall the result could be incredible carnage in the late 20th century from the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and the possibility of a third country provoking a nuclear war between the united states and russia the worlds most volatile regionsthe middle east and south asiaalready include five countries reported either to have the capability to construct nuclear weapons or to be actively seeking that capability in a worst case libya israel iraq pakistan and india could all have nuclear weapons within a few years the actions of these countries will not be independent of each other the nations are connected in a complicated fashion by enmity and cooperationthus the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one of these nations is likely to generate similar actions by others the region has suffered from major wars every few years the introduction of nuclear weapons into these wars could threaten millions of deaths in the region the destruction of the petroleum transportation facilities through which 40 percent of the western worlds oil must pass and the threat of annihilation of much of the worlds population through fallout or the provocation of wider nuclear conflict even the fear that one of these nations was attempting to acquire nuclear weapons could lead to armed conflict the iraqi nuclear program already has been the subject of assassinations and an air attack with conventional munitions of these five countries three of their governments came to power through internal military takeovers nuclear weapons in such internally unstable countries may not remain in the hands of the national governments subnational forces attempting a takeover are likely to try to seize the nuclear weapons sooner or later nuclear weapons or the material for their manufacture may fall into the hands of smaller military units or terrorists groups the middle east and south asia is the most dangerous region for nuclear proliferation in the near future but the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons reportedly has been sought by south africa south korea taiwan argentina and brazil and this is only the situation is the early 1980s the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one country is likely to lead to a chain reaction in which the enemies or rivals of that country then feel that they must acquire nuclear weapons some politicians in nigeria for example have already called for a nigerian weapons program aimed at the possibility that south africa will acquire nuclear weapons the same applies for syria visavis iraq proliferation need not stop with the acquisition of a few bombs of the type used by the united states against japan at the end of world war iiweapons that in the context of a small nuclear war could cause millions of deaths the next stop can be thermonuclear weaponsraising the death toll to tens of million of people or more or the next step may be long range delivery vehicles spreading the threat of nuclear destruction to nations far removed from the regional conflict in short proliferation is a major international security threat and it will certainly get worse if we do not take the lead with the other nuclear weapons powers to stop it for these reasons american policy has long featured a strong consensus opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons the reagan administration however is striving to undermine the good bipartisan unitedstates example set by previous presidents not only is mr reagan indifferent to the proliferation risks posed by civilian nuclear technology he has graphically illustrated that indifference by considering the use to make nuclear weapons of plutonium derived from spent fuel produced in civilian nuclear powerplants even worse he is considering for the first time in our history the export of sensitive reprocessing and enrichment technologies to nonnuclear weapons countries such exports would have tragic consequences and must not be permitted i intend soon to propose legislation to block mr reagans thoughtless move the united states simply must exercise its strongest leadership with its allies to prevent nuclear profits from overcoming the restraint necessary for nuclearage survival thankfully there are americans who are seeking to correct these irrational policies and to change our course away from nuclear devastation they recognize that nuclear war is not winable as this administration has claimed and they realize the danger in spending hundreds of billions of h 1262 co dollars on a massive nuclear weapons buildup without incorporating arms control and proliferation prevention into our national security policies i commend those who are resisting these senseless administration initiatives and i pledge my efforts to do all i can to see that congress does everything in its power to reverse those policies which come to us from the white house our efforts to stop this nuclear madness are essential if we are to live in a secure stable and peaceful world i am including in todays record the

social security issue into perspective as a result of the reagan administrations scare tactics the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"],

colleagues in supporting its passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to vote for the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill from foreign affairs spring 19801"], [0.9985167384147644, 0.9985167384147644, 0, "i

title ii of h r 1799 the antitrust provisions which were referred to the judiciary committee and to which the subcommittee on monopolies and commercial law gave long and careful consideration there were times when i and others felt that our consideration was becoming altogether too long and too careful but the bill which we have ultimately reported is a good one and merits the support of every member it is difficult to discuss this legislation without some reference to h r 5235 formerly h r 2326 the bill introduced by chairman rodino and myself to clarify the application of the antitrust laws to export trade activities this was our initial response to the complaint that many american businessmen were unwilling or unable to compete with confidence in the international marketplace because of their uncertainty regarding their antitrust liability that bill reflects our belief that the proper response to exporters who believe the law is unclear is to clarify the law this it seems to me is far more important than the licensing procedures such as the provisions in the export trading legislation passed by the senate as the rodinomcclory bill has moved forward it became evident that nothing less than some sort of certification system was desired by the business community even if h r 5235 were to be enacted clarifying the nonapplication of our antitrust laws to purely foreign activities title ii of h r 1799 is the judiciary committees considered response it compares extremely favorably with the senate approach i might say in terms of simplified procedure expedit0ed processing and certain results it provides exporters with a binding advisory opinion on the legality of their proposed conduct rather than providing an outright antitrust exemption as the senate bill attempts to do this eliminates also the cumbersome requirement that exporters establish a special need as a condition precedent to exemption the 6nly issue to be decided in processing an application under our bill is whether the proposed conduct is likely to violate the antitrust laws of the united states the members of the monopolies and commercial law subcommittee were virtually unanimous therefore in deciding that this determination should be made by the department of justice rather than by the department of commerce there would seem to be little benefit conferred by an antitrust certificate from the department of commerce which the department of justice could attack and it would be wrong to bar the antitrust division from exercising its enforcement function in my opinion without its first having the opportunity to subject the proposed conduct to antitrust review an optional forwarding role for the commerce department is allowed nevertheless which should encourage the applicant to use that agencys informational and advisory services careful thought was also given to the question of damages which may be recovered by a person injured by an antitrust violation committed by a person acting pursuant to a certificate there is no question of course that treble damages lie for conduct outside of the certificate it is also possile however although unlikely that certified conduct may result in injury in domestic commerce although the administration and the senate have suggested that certified conduct should be totally immune from liability the judiciary committee of the house firmly believes that single damages are most necessary and appropriate it is sometimes forgotten that antitrust damages are not only a penalty but a protection and the person compensated most often will be another american business with a legitimate clair to be made whole for its antitrust injury single damages for domestic injury by the holder of an export trade certificate were perceived as a fair compromise between the traditional statutory treble damages and no damages if no damages were to be the rule the governmental agency granting certification would have to be more conservative in close cases granting benefits to fewer applicants furthermore fairness would also then require that greater procedural protections be provided for interested parties who feared future injury since such parties would subsequently be denied damages on the other hand with single damages as the rule certification could take place administratively without a hearing without third parties arguing their case and thus without protracted delays finally if no damages were to be the rule the only way a court could compensate the injured american business would be to hold the conduct in question to be ultra vires outside the certificate in which case treble damages would lie with a singledamages rule however the court would have a fairer solution availableone which compensates the injured party but does not punish the wrongdoer who believed that his conduct fell within the scope of the certificate some have argued that the senate bill is preferable because it protects exporters from lawsuits by providing zero damages rather than single damages where certified conduct causes the complained of injury but our committee has given this argument a long hard look talked to antitrust lawyers and found this argument without merit for the senate bill would only change the nature of pleading antitrust violations and probably result in treble damage awards on grounds that the conduct in question was ultra vires our bill would preserve and assure single damages for the injured plaintiff but would restrain the filing of lawsuits against exporters by means of the most liberal provision of attorneys fees for defendants within the sweep of my experience for if the certified conduct has not violated the antitrust laws the plaintiff must pay to the defendant exporter a reasonable attorneys fee even if the suit was brought in good faith and even if the suit was nonfrivolous that should make plaintiffs think twice about suing an exporter holding a certificate this bill has been carefully constructed to provide greater certainty to exporters by providing them the assurance of an antitrust review and certification procedure i believe it will enable american businessmen to compete with far greater confidence and freedom of action overseas this is what you want it is what i want and it is what our national interest requires having worked

particularly dependent on the minimum social security benefit the effort to eliminate the minimum social security benefit will surely amplify the vulnerability of older women in america and the extent to which they depend on social security in their old age by eliminating the minimum benefit we will compound the existing economic inequities against women inequities that will worsen the already

understand it in crease in tariffs as the gentleman pointed out interestingly in that congress after hoovers election and it was a republican congress the debate over smoothawley was not unlike the debate over what we are going through today there were amendments all over the lot and the smoothawley bill was not going anywhere until the northeastern members of the congress joined in and decided to do for the northeastern manufacturing what the republican midwestern members were trying to do for agriculture if you go back and look at the stock market crash of 1929 there is an inextricable link i believe between the debate on the amendments as they came to the floor and were passed in 1929 and 1930 and the crash of the stock and equity values forecasting the drop in world trade and the contraction of the economy which followed my friend the gentleman from california is doing the house a great service indeed he is doing the people of the country a great service by bringing this to their attention i want to remind my colleague that the bill was signed in 1930 but its most important provisions were passed in october of 1929 indeed they passed at the very same time that the market crashed there are people and i am one of them who believe that the drop in equity value preceding the drop in trade was a response to the tremendous increase in tariffs not only on agriculture but on manufacturing is it any coincidence that the stock market has dropped 30 points only yesterday and today i would say parenthetically that when the congress passed the smoothawley tariff act almost every reputable economist every finance minister in the world begged president hoover not to sign the bill and when he said he might not sign it the stock market recovered about 80 percent of its value from october of 1929 and that crash on into june of 1930 and then hoover signed it and the stock market crash of june 1930 was almost as great as the stock market crash of within weeks i would say to my friend the gentleman from california every single nation in europe raised its tariffs to match the tariffs of the united states and the world contraction resulted we went into a terrible deficit taxes were raised by president hoover and the congress monetary policy tightened in response to the money panic and we went into the terrible depression why do i bring it up to demonstrate by

for this ludicrous situation only a white house more interested in scenarios than fiscal responsiblity could first present congress with a stillborn budget proposal and then launch a media blitz complaining that congress was damaging chances for economic recovery by constantly delaying the budget process this administration keeps faulting congress for not immediately making hard choices necessary to prepare a budget that is tantamount to a doctor strangling his patient and then complaining because the clergy cant bring him back to life this administration has failed to make any hard

a president sent up a budget knowing it was doomed and then gone riding off into the sunsetleavins congress to struggle without a scintilla of presidential leadership this is a disgrace and the american people know where the blame lies it lies with the president of the united states and his colleagues yesterday and today we have tried to write a budget for the united states on the floor of the house of representativesand we will continue to try though as everett dirksen used to say there will be blood in the well up to our boottops before we are through i i have looked at all the substitutes and find their deficits with one exception because it has no deficit absolutely unacceptableand i believe the banking community wall street the american taxpayer the bluecollar and whiteshirted workers the labor leadership the small businessman and the corporate boardroom the family struggling to send their children to college or graduate school persons concerned with the environment the black community and minorities generally will also find them unacceptable the one exception to this view of course is the substitute offered by the geitleman from california but he balances his budget for 1983 on the backs of the elderly the poor the sick students farmers the housing automoble and steel indus tries and their workersand leaves essentially intact the unfair tax cuts and tax loopholes for corporations and wealthy individuals his sensitivity to human needs i need not dwell onhis substitute speaks for itself i just do not believe the american voter will return to office any member of the house of representatives or senator of whatever party who with a straight face presents a budget deficit for 1983 ranging from 96 8 billion to 109 4 billionand claims this was the best he or she could do and is in his constituents best interest if the white house likes scenarios this scenario is one of political suicide we all know that with a deficit of about 100 billion there will be no easing of interest rates you can have faith you can have trustand you can believe in this administrations economic policies if you care to but i respectfully suggest to you that this administration will still be forecasting the roaring back of the econom7 ad infinitum administration budget and economic experts must have known in their hearts that their deficit for 1983 was at the time they presented it in excess of 150 billion they also knew that their proposed defense increases and insistence on maintaining tax subsidies for the rich was feeding those deficits deficits which keep interest rates up workers unemploy d rnd families unable to buy homes cars clothes college educations for their children and the like administration economists of all people should have learned the lesson from franklin delano roosevelt when he said we have known that heedless selfinterest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics it is bad economics to fatten the rich even more than they are already bloated it is also bad short and longterm politics this administration is riding into the sunset of political oblivion with its economic brand exposed in full view to the american people k that brand spells greed and uncontrollable greed is exactly what we are seeing as the hallmark of this administration and its misguided and selfdestructive economic policies may i first talk about corporate tax subsidies the combination of accelerated depreciation leasing of tax credits plus investment credits means that all of corporate america will soon reach the zero rate of taxation already achieved by such profitable corporations as occidental petroleum ltv and burlington northern rather than helping directly those companies which should receive tax relief these budgets are helping out very profitable corporations at an extraordinary cost to the treasury the taxpayers and to the future economic recovery of this nation those special interests who gathered in washington for the lear jet weekend may find that in aiming to raid the treasurythey really ended up shooting themselves in the corporate foot the feeding frenzy generated around the federal tax trough degenerated into an exercise in timelapse cannibalism their tax benefits are costing the nation revenues it does not haveare hiking interest rates and the deficit to ungodly levelsand helping kill the recovery needed to generate their own profits and sustain healthy economic growth and the creation of jobs for the millions upon millions of anericans out of work besides reducing the revenue hemorrhageinduced by the tax benefit given to corporations and the wealthy last yearanother way in which we could cut the deficit is by repealing reducing or delaying the third year tax cut however neither the tiny net tax saving of the middle income nor the several thousands realized by those with income in six figures are justification for the economic p nalties we will all pay through persistent high interest rates if the third year tax cut is left untouched repeal or reductions in the third year tax cut are essential if money managers and investors are to be convinced of our determination to reduce deficits it is far better to adjust the third year tax cut ant thus lower interest rates and create jobs than to maintain a tax cut which guarantees that the unemployed do not even have incomes on which to pay taxes defense spending is the third area where significant federal revenues can be saved the president wants to increase defense spending by from 13 to 18 percent above inflation the house budget committee would increase defense spending by 5 percent above leflation while the committee proposaland otherscut actual spending for 1983 between 10 and 15 billion they are really merely nibbling at this mammoth fiscal cheese i maintain that before we have a truly credible defenseand one which we can sustain without seriously eroding the economywe must repair the economic damage this administrations policies have caused to our great productive economic machine better to reduce defense spending by 50 to 60 billion than risk continued and deepening recession of the economy while experiencing runaway inflation and horrendous cost overruns in the defense sector defense spending can and must be reduced significantly beyond what any of these budgets before us propose a delay of several years will not have the russians launching their strategic missiles at us assuredly cuba will not strike out at us our present military strength is such that no nation on earth would dare risk assured mutual destruction defense spending ranging from 191 to 214 billion as proposed by the various substitutes is just too high during this period of economic crisis i feel sure our allies in nato and around the world would feel far more secure s9eing a unitedstates economy in good healthwith rational interest rates with greater production and productivity and with a dollar valued to facilitate rather than dampen world trade as the saying goes when the american economy has a cold the world economy catches pneumonia these three revenue sources must be tapped the american worker running out of unemployment benefits has lost patience with this president and this administration the congress must bite the bullet and present the american people with a budget which will foster economic growth and the creation of jobs for the mllions and millions out of work we must repeal or adjust the tax benefits passed out last year during a moment of fiscal drunkenness on the part of this administration and the congresstax benefits which i happened to have voted for unfortunate ly we must repeal or adjust the third year tax cutwhich again i voted for unfortunately we must reduce defense spending to a level consistent with economic realities we cannot accept continuing deficits in the 100 billion plus renge in spite or what our republican savior the gentleman from new york has said interest rates will not come down if deficits remain at current or higher levels we must secure the revenues necessary to achieve that and the areas i have indicated are those which i believe will produce increased revenues without cutting off economic recovery good government costs moneyby good government i mean that which helps peoplenot hurts them we should be investing in a government that truly cares for those who cannot care for themselves to have carelessly defaulted in his leadership responsibilities on the budget indicates that this president is greatly at odds with the view the vast majority of americans hold of the american government and its responsibilities i believe this president and those around him truly misread the american people they listen too much to the rhetorical grumblings and not enough to what the people really feel the american people instinctively understand what teddy roosevelt and his cousin franklin talked about when they used the word

jurisdiction over civil rights complaints has often been to deny swift and fair justice for persons who have been discriminated against the backlog in federal agencies creates unnecessary delays additional costs and causes further overcrowding in already overburdened federal courts this problem is not endemic to the reagan administration in 1977 many of those who have cosponsored h r 5689

with some of the specifics of the bill as well as its timing they are in accord with the view that civil rights enforcement should be strengthened their recent report on the current problems of the

is essential to restoring the trust of the american people in this congress at a time when citizens are increasingly distrustful of public officials at all levels of government it is vital that there be no taint of dishonor in the congress the most important legislative body in the land last years actions by the congress to increase substantially the compensation of its members were extremely disillusioning to millions of americans at a time when the president and the congress were asking tremendous sacrifices of most americansparticularly low and middleincome americanswe removed the limits on the tax deduction for expenses members incur by living in washington and we raised the outside earnings limitation which serves as a curb on the amount of money members may earn from special interests for making speeches writing articles et cetra in the senate that limit was eliminated entirely while in the house it was doubled to over 18 000 one of the worst aspects of this entire situation was that no separate rolleall vote was taken on any of these actions indeed with regard to the increase in the outside earnings limits in the house a rolleall vote taken only a few weeks before the increase was granted by a voice vote showed a solid majority of members opposing the increase only through subterfugeby bringing up the resolution without the knowledge or true consent of most memberswas this measure able to gain approval it has always been my belief that no salary increase enacted by the congress should take effect until the following congress is elected i feel this way for two reasons first there is an inherent conflict of interest in a specific congress voting itself a pay raise and second the voters should have an opportunity to endorse or reject an incumbent member or another cdndidate at the new actual salary members will earn throughout a new congress for this reason i have followed this policy myself since i entered the house in 1977 turning back pay increases until the voters of my district have had the chance to endorse or reject me at the higher pay level i am following that same policy with regard to the tax and outside earnings changes enacted last year and will not accept those increases until after the upcoming election i believe the entire congress can and should maintain this kind of policy i also believe that if the reasons for enacting a raise are legitimate members should not need to avoid going on record in support of such an increase finally i believe we cannot simply let last years actions standi believe the increase in the outside earnings limit should be postponed until the next congress in addition because it provides such a potentially huge windfall to members the elimination of the 3 000 limit on the tax deduction for members washington expenses should be rescinded entirely the ways and means committee should then reconsider the issue so that it can find a moderate level at which this limit can be setone that recognizes legitimate expenses but does not make members of congress a privileged class as the existing provision does therefore i have introduced several measures which i will now describe first a bill to prevent any salary increase from becoming effective until the seating of the congress following that in which the increase was approved the bill would also prevent a lameduck congress from enacting a pay increase for the following congress to prevent such an increase from becoming effective without any input from the voters second a resolution to prevent the house from voting members any salary increase any increase in outside earnings or any tax credit or deduction that applies to them as a distinct class without a separate rolleall vote on the issue third a bill to repeal the effect of the tax breaks congress voted itself last year fourth a resolution to delay until january 1 1983 the effective date of the increase in the outside earnings limitation for members of the house i am not someone who believes that there is no appropriate time for pay increases for members of congress this is a fulltime job and when it is done properly it is hard work but there are benefits and responsibilities that go along with this job that cannot be quantified but are more significant than any pay we might receive the benefit of having the ability to affect national policies to provide enormous help to people to contribute to the wellbeing of the nation and the world cannot be overestimated in addition the responsibility that comes along with that privilege and power means that we cannot abuse our mandatewe must remain accountable to our constituents therefore while we should not be afraid to raise our salaries when it is appropriate we should also remember that our jobs bring benefits no other american can share so those increases must be limited and we must remember to whom we are responsible and must be willing to tell our constituents that we feel a raise is merited and needed and that we are willing to go on record in support of such an increase only when the congress adopts a resonalie and honest policy with regard to pay
