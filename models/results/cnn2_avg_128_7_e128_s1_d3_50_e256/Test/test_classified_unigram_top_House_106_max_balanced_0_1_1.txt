rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us go to conference"], [3.5762786865234375e-07, 0.9999996423721313, 1, "i wish to congratulate the gentleman from south carolina for this motion i rise to endorse it and ask my colleagues to accept it my district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i support a budget that invest strengthening social security provides an affordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors helps communities improve public education with quality teachers smaller classes greater accountability and modem schools and pay down the national debt these are the policies that invest in our children

in this congress over the last several years that is an issue that really is a fundamental issue of fairness an issue of fairness that the american people have been asking some pretty basic questions about over the last several years i represent the south side of chicago the south suburbs in cook and will counties as well as bedroom communities and farm communities in illinois and i found whether i was in the steel workers union hall in hegwish or a neighborhood in chicago or at the local legion post in joliet or the local grain elevator in tonica people often ask a basic question is it right is it fair that under our tax code that the average married working couple pays higher taxes just because they are married they say why do the folks in washington allow a tax code to be in place that tells us that if we choose to get married and work we are going to pay more in taxes they are stunned when they learn that 28 million married working couples pay an average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married clearly the marriage tax penalty suffered by working married people is fundamentally wrong and something we should change i am so pleased that the leadership of this house the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois has made reduction and elimination of the marriage tax penalty the first priority this year first out of the box and on a fast track as a taxrelated initiative to help middleclass families the marriage tax penalty has been in place for almost 30 years and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased this republican congress has made a decision to bring fairness to the tax code by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty the marriage tax penalty is something that affects real people i have a photo here of a young couple from joliet illinois shad and michelle hallihan two school teachers they teach in the local public schools in joliet shad and michelle suffer a marriage tax penalty of almost a thousand dollars because they are married they recently had a child a baby and as michelle hallihan pointed out to me she said that 1 000 the marriage tax penalty that they suffer that is 3 000 diapers that they can buy for their child that goes to uncle sam instead of taking care of their child it is real money 1 400 in joliet illinois where shad and michelle live is one years tuition at joliet community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center let me explain how it came about our tax code has grown more complicated and since the late 1960s married working couples moms and dads husbands and wives with two incomes have paid higher taxes just because they are married of course we have made this a priority and i would like to announce of course this wednesday the committee on ways and means is going to be marking up committee action will occur on legislation essentially to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost 28 million married work couples a real change that is going to help people this is how the marriage tax penalty works take a machinist and a school teacher in the south suburbs of chicago they have identical incomes this machinist is making 31 500 as a single person under our tax code he is going to be taxed at 15 percent rate so he meets a school teacher a gal with an identical income of 31 500 and they choose to get married and at the point they choose to get married they begin filing their taxes jointly when we file our taxes jointly we combine our two incomes in this case this machinist and school teacher who previously were taxed at 15 percent because they chose to get married their combined income pushes their combined income to 63 000 they pay almost 1 400 more in higher taxes because they are pushed under our tax code into the 28 percent tax bracket the higher tax bracket that is wrong but today that is the current situation for working married couples so really the incentives is in the wrong place marriage is one of the most basic institutions in our society and our tax code punishes marriage i would point out that had this machinist and school teacher chose to live together outside of marriage they would not suffer that extra tax only when they choose to get married do they pay that higher tax and i think we all agree that is wrong that we impose higher taxes on married working people i am proud to say that the house republican leadership under the leadership of speaker hastert has made elimination of the marriage tax penalty our first initiative in an effort to bring fairness to the tax code and lower the tax burden on working families this afternoon the gentleman from texas unveiled the legislation that will provide tax relief for 28 million married working couples it is similar almost identical in many ways to the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 legislation that we introduced earlier this year which now has 230 cosponsors and overwhelming majority of republicans and i am pleased that 12 democrats have joined with us in an effort to make this a bipartisan proposal let me briefly share what the proposal that we will be working on in the committee on ways and means on wednesday will do it is the goal of the house to act and approve and send to the senate by february 14 valentines day our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty think about it what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working people than elimination of the marriage tax penalty this legislation will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost everybody who suffers it that will be a big change in our tax code the legislation that we will be acting on and voting out of the house in the next couple of weeks will help 28 million married working couples for those who do not itemize their taxes they will see immediately 230 dollars in marriage tax relief for those who itemize because they own a home they will see 1 400 marriage tax relief under this legislation i would point out that this makes a big difference under our plan we provide immediate marriage tax relief in 2001 next year helping millions of couples and because we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles 3 million married working couples will see their tax code simplified because they will no longer need to itemize and fill out extra forms so we make filing for taxes easier and for those who do itemize primarily homeowners they will see marriage tax relief as well twentyeight million married work couples will see up to 1 400 in marriage tax relief as a result of what the committee on ways and means will approve on wednesday and i expect that an overwhelming majority of this house will see it approved before valentines day what a great valentines day gift that we can give 28 million married working couples elimination of the marriage tax penalty i am joined by a number of my colleagues today who have been real leaders in the effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty as i pointed out earlier of the 435 members of this house we need 217 to pass a bill so an overwhelming majority of the house have joined in cosponsoring this bill i am joined today by a number of cosponsors of this legislation who have stepped forward and fought hard to eliminate the marriage tax penalty at this time i would like to yield to the

and i believe that eventually and we hope that eventually this will see the beginning of a resolution that really deals with communitybased efforts i rise this morning to strike the language that limits the use of funding of federal transportation dollars for the planning design or construction of a light rail system in houston texas this is an effort to speak on this floor and to ask for collaborative support on communitybased efforts dealing with the great needs of regional mobility in an area that is working to comply with clean air requirements as a representative of the aiea that would see the benefits of this light rail project and as a representative from houston that would see the larger benefits i want this floor to know that this is a collective and collaborative effort houston metro simply wants to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the monies would come from other local sources what better collaborative federallocal government collaboration than to see the matching funds the effort that the community is making the light rail project has been vetted extensively in our community it has been vetted by the metro board the city council the mayor of houston who is of course a supporter i have received support from the local surrounding congressional members the gentlemen from texas mr green mr lampson mr doggetr and mr turner the mayor of the city of houston the county judge of the city of houston the houston partnership the medical center the astrodome area of which this connector would connect if we just envision a straight line going through a myriad of areas in a city some high some low this light rail connector is in fact a dream effort to ensure a working laboratory to give further data and insight into the idea oirregional mobility it connects the large astrodome where the republican national convention was held along through some depressed areas along through our museum area the rice university main h3438 coi street as most of our towns have their main street which have fallen upon hard times then into our vibrant downtown area and connecting the university of houston downtown that serves a high population of hispanics and african americans this light rail is a win win circumstance it is a system that has been frugal in its analysis no comment or criticism has come from the department of transportation that this is not a good system no criticism has come that they are overrun with the new executive director and ceo of the metro shirley delibero we brought in a very fine rail professional we know for sure that this rail system will help to generate feeder lines if the community so desires in parts west north south and east reaching to all parts of this metroplex as we have seen the proposal of the light rail we have seen a light come into the area we have seen the beginning of a 27story highrise office building we have seen the work of trammell crow residential which is evaluating from 250 unit multiservice or multifamily housing complex in midtown houston we have seen camden development complete a 337unit apartment project in midtown and mccord development which has two highrise office redevelopment projects underway frankly what i am hoping that as we evidence to this body both democrats and republicans alike although this does not rise to the level of a point of order it is a limitation we ask that this body give respect and credence to a collective group of individuals who have sought only to see a return on their tax dollars and to match the work that has gone on in washington d c that has moved people from place to place seattle washington our sister city dallas texas and many other parts of this nation that have had rail and have seen the pollution come down and people being moved efficiently this city is seeking to have their olympics in 2012 and i know by saying that i might rise the ire of some of the other competing cities but we are working very hard to bring that olympics to the united states of course and certainly to texas and certainly to houston this is a real key component to doing that an economic engine and i do believe that those who may find fault with what has happened in the past in 1991 will come to the realization that they can find no fault in what is going on right now there have been meetings and hearings and there are stakeholders and people are concerned i would ask my colleagues to consider this as we proceed i would have liked to see this amendment come to the end i intend at the conclusion of the debate to withdraw this amendment because i am hoping that we can enter into an abbreviated colloquy to say that we will work together i see the gentleman from texas on the floor of the house i want to work with him but i do want us as a community to be able to move into the 21st century i look forward to my colleagues working with me and the gentleman from texas on this very important issue i rise with my colleague mr bentsen to offer an amendment to section 331 of this bill h r 4475 that would only prevent funding for the planning design or construction of a community supported light rail system in houston texas as a representative for the 18th congressional district in houston i fully support the transit funding that was appropriated for houston and approved by the department of transportation for the light rail project the houston metro was to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the 235 million needed would come from local funds slated to build park and ride centers and other projects the light rail project is supported by the houston metro the surrounding congressional districts of congressmen bentsen who is a cosponsor of this amendment gene green lampson doggett and turner the business community the mayor of houston lee p brown and the harris county presiding elected official judge robert eckels this light rail project is a winwin situation for everyone in houston as well as the millions of people who visit every year in that it would attract and focus new development and an economic boom around the station areas and to the economically depressed areas within the city of houston and the 18th congressional district which i represent in fact an independent overview written by the greater houston partnership which includes the houston chamber of commerce houston economic development organization and houston world trade stated that the economic impact of the light rail project in houston would have an estimated incremental development over the 20012020 period ranging from 0 percent to 40 percent the light rail project would also reinvigorate retail sales in downtown houston as well as link the two principal employment centers of houston which is made up of 200 000 employees some of the local businesses that began to plan for the economic boom that the light rail project would bring are century development which started plans to build a 27story high rise office building with a 1 500 space parking garage and 50 000 square feet of retail space trammel crow residential which is evaluating two 250300 unit multifamily housing complex in midtown houston camden development which recently completed a 337 unit apartment project in midtown and mccord development which has two 2 highrise office redevelopment projects underway totaling over 50 million in renovation fees these are only some of the redevelopment that is being implemented as a result of the light rail project in houston which was to receive federal funding houston has also been hit with major concerns about air quality and requirements for improving its air quality through better mobility plans therefore the light rail project for houston is of urgent need to the community the main street light project is welcomed by the residents of houston light rail will help alleviate houstons traffic congestion problem and significantly reduce the number of motorists that presently pollute the air with exhaust the light rail project will play a pivotal role in regional transportation among other benefits the light rail project will service all day transit demand including peak hours it will relieve bus congestion in the urban core as buses from throughout the region currently converge on downtown this project will offer a transportation choice to many area residents who will choose to leave their vehicles at home i will be absolutely opposed to any efforts in the appropriations committee that would hinder or prohibit the timely funding of this urgently needed project i urge my colleagues to support this amendment"], [2.096412117680302e-06, 2.096412117680302e-06, 0, "of course today is known as valentines day it is a great day for those who care for one another it is a day of the heart this past week we had some important action in this house of representatives which affect 28 million married working couples who because of their heart pay higher taxes the american people have often told me that they are frustrated they think it is unfair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that really is a fundamental question is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more now i represent the south side of chicago and the south suburbs in illinois and folks back home they tell me that 1 400 is a years tuition for a nursing student at a community college in illinois it is a washer and a dryer it is several months worth of car payments it is 3 months of day care but it is higher taxes money that is taken from married couples just because they are married that is wrong of course valentines day is today and today is the day that we can celebrate the fact that the house passed h r 6 legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples let me explain how the marriage tax penalty works if one is single of course they file as a single person but when they get married they file jointly they combine their incomes the way our tax code works is if a couple is a machinist and a schoolteacher with identical incomes say a machinist makes 31 000 if he stays single he pays in the 15 percent tax bracket but if he meets and marries a public school teacher with an identical income of 31 000 their 62 000 combined income pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket they pay the average tax penalty of almost 1 400 just because they got married right now the tax code discourages marriage by punishing it with financial penalties that is wrong this past week the house passed h r 6 and i want to commend the leadership of the house speaker dennis hastert for moving a standalone clean marriage tax elimination legislation there is no other extraneous provisions there are no excuses like the president used last year when he vetoed our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty we deal with one issue that is wiping out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples i would point out that h r 6 helps married couples in a number of ways if one looks at who pays the marriage tax penalty one half of married couples h346 cop itemize their taxes because they own a home or give money to church or synagogue or charity or have education expenses the other half do not so we help both in the legislation that we passed we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles and for those who do itemize and of course most middleclass families own their home so they are required to itemize their taxes so we help them by widening the 15 percent bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much in the 15 percent bracket as a single filer it is fair that way we also help i would point out the working poor with addressing the marriage penalty that is in the eligibility for joint filers for married couples for the earned income credit to help the working poor so we double the standard deduction we widen the 15 percent bracket we address the earned income credit marriage penalty and we help 25 million married working couples by being fair it is time that we make the tax code fair it is time that we make the tax code marriage neutral so that one is not punished when they get married of course i am proud our proposal does not raise taxes on anyone else in order to wipe out the marriage tax penalty so two single people two married people no one pays more taxes than the other it is the fair way to do it and i am proud that 268 members of this house every republican and fortunately 48 democrats broke from their leadership and supported our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty that is progress tremendous momentum an overwhelming majority of the house supported our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty an issue of fairness for 25 million married working couples i am concerned though i have been told that there are some in the senate who want to load up the marriage tax elimination effort they want to put poison pills and they want to put other extraneous provisions on this bill my hope is we can avoid that my hope is that we can convince the senate to keep it a standalone clean marriage tax elimination bill that is the best approach that way it is fair there are no excuses for the president to veto it this time he said during the state of the union that he thought we should address the marriage tax penalty we want the president to keep his word we want to give the president the opportunity to do that by sending him a standalone bill there is no need for partisan politics we had a bipartisan vote when this legislation passed the house this past week and what better gift to give 25 million married working couples on this valentines day then enactment into law the marriage tax penalty act"], [2.2649765014648438e-06, 0.9999977350234985, 1, "i rise this evening to continue to call on this congress to pass a real school construction legislation without delay before our adjournment for the year we have missed opportunities after opportunities to stop our partisan wrangling and pass a meaningful bill and reach the priorities that we need to reach with this legislation as a congressman from north carolinas second congressional district i represent an area of the country that has undergone some tremendous growth over the last several years in communities throughout my district and across this country our schools are bursting at the seams our local communities are struggling to provide resources to build new schools and to repair old ones and get children out of trailers and just fix up old rundown buildings for nearly 4 years now i have worked with my colleagues in the house on both sides of the political aisle to provide leadership on this important issue and pass a common sense bill that will help our local schools deal with this critical problem we have come together to support h r 4094 the rangeljohnsonetheridge bill that is sponsored by the republican congresswoman from connecticut and my friend from new york this important bill will provide 25 billion in school construction bonds for our local communities to build schools for our children it really provides national leadership on this issue that is critical to the american people a clear majority of the members of this house have supported h r 4094 228 members democrats and republicans alike have signed on as cosponsors the house will pass this bill if we can only get a chance to vote on it the president has stated that he will sign this important legislation the minute it reaches his desk we have an opportunity to provide real leadership and pass this measure to help provide educational opportunities for our children but unfortunately the republican leadership of this house has chosen the path of confrontation and gridlock over the opportunity for consensus and progress rather than working together to produce a common sense solution to the need for school construction the republican leadership brought to the floor today a bill that was a sham of a school construction measure instead of fully funding the costeffective rangeljohnson bill the republican leaderships bill would shift funds to much less effective arbitrage relief and private activity bonds the arbitrage proposal would provide schools with only 24 per 1 000 in bonds compared with 624 per 1 000 in bonds in the rangeljohnson bill in addition because schools would have to delay construction for at least 2 years to receive any benefits areas with the most urgent need would not be able to build the buildings that they need the private activity bonds benefit only those schools available to find a forprofit company willing to pay upfront construction costs neither arbitrage nor private activity bonds target assistance to the schools that so badly need it today the members of this house have an obligation a solemn responsibility in my opinion to work together to craft common sense solutions to the problems facing americas schools but rather we do not work hard to meet the responsibility that is before us the republican leadership has chosen to pass a sham proposal a bill that is truly going to be vetoed they knew it was going to be vetoed when it passed today the republican tax bill contains many provisions that i supported but the sad fact is the republican leadership chose to include many good provisions in a fundamentally flawed bill in addition the leadership today pushed through an appropriations bill that provides 687 million in grants to states to build prisons i supported that provision because we probably need to build some but to me it is the wrong priority to pass prisons before we build schools in conclusion i remain an optimist we still have time to pass a real school construction bill before this congress adjourns and i urge the

for the last 42 years have been asked in town meetings and senior citizens centers union halls vfws and other public forums when is washington going to stop dipping into when is washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund to spend social security on other things other than social security today we are going to pass legislation that will do that that will stop the raid on social security let us review the history here for over 30 years now washington has been dipping into the s6cial security fund regardless of the rhetoric on the other side where they say it has not it has gone on back when president johnson and the democratcontrolled congress 30 years ago began raiding the social security trust fund they have run up quite a bill according to the social security trustees appointed by president clinton the social security trust fund has been raided by more than 730 billion over the last 30 years i have a check here written on the social security trust fund it is a blank check washington for the last 30 years has used the social security trust fund as a slush fund and as a blank check to pay for other programs this walls off the social security trust fund and puts a stop for those who want to raid it we set aside those funds for social security and for medicare i believe that is an important first step setting aside 100 percent of social security and locking it away before we consider any other reforms or changes to social security let us lock it away first that is an important first step we can use those funds to strengthen medicare and social security this legislation accomplishes this goal i would like to point out of course that not only is the social security and medicare safe deposit box a centerpiece of this years balanced budget but there is a big difference between the clintongore democratic budget and the republican budget the republican budget sets aside 100 percent of social security for social security the 137 billion social security surplus this year will go to social security if we compare that with the clintongore democrat budget that only uses 62 percent of social security for social security and the clintongore democrat budget spends 52 billion of social security money on other things all good programs education defense things like that but the clintongore democrat budget raids the social security trust fund this lockbox will prevent the clintongore raid on social security i would also point out that the social security and medicare safe deposit box sets aside 1 8 trillion the president talks about 62 percent sixtytwo percent is 1 3 billion over the next 10 years clintongore will raid the social security trust fund by 12 billion let us put a stop to it"], [3.1887116165307816e-06,

abuse in the federal government and in federal spending i want to start out by alerting members to a brief history lesson on where congressional overspending has gone over the last 30 years in fact going back to 1970 members can see the line below the baseline here is the amount of money that the congress has spent money that it did not have this is deficit quantity spending back in 1970 we began a dangerous habit and trend going down here in 1976 here we were at almost 100 billion in deficits we continued to drop and drop spending more and more without regard to the cash that was on hand for the federal government we can see here in 1982 and 1986 the height of democrat control of congress was when we were on a virtually spending spree here in washington then when deficits got at about their worst down in this area that is about the point in time that the american people changed their mind this is when the republican revolution took place americans were fed up with a congress that year after year after year from 1970 right on up to the 19921993 fiscal years had spent more money than it had on hand in fact borrowing from my children and the children of every other american in order to appease the spending appetite and habits of washington that ended at about this point here we can see the line beginning to go up when a new idea a new party was put in charge with majority status in congress members can see when we took over that the deficit spending began to ease that we began to start moving toward a goal of spending the dollars that we actually had on hand to run the legitimate purposes of the federal government back there in 1994 when republicans took over the congress they promised in a great contract with america that we would balance the budget by the year 2002 well we underpromised and overdelivered because right here in 1998 was the first year in 30 years that the expenditures came above the line here of our baseline spending in other words we began to start saving money this little purple section here represents a cash surplus that we began to accumulate here in washington d c it is this surplus that has allowed us to do a number of things one it has allowed us to stop borrowing the money i would remind my colleagues when we start borrowing money spending more money than the congress actually has to spend we borrow it from somewhere and the fund of preference for many many years has been the social security system in fact this congress and the white house has raided the social security trust fund the social security system to the tune of about 638 billion over a little bit shorter of a time frame this goes back to 1984 once again we can take a look at where we were when we came here and president clinton continued and this was the year of the tax increase and the year that the congress spent quite a lot of money at the presidents insistence again in 1998 this congress got serious about stopping the raid on social security members can see the dramatic decrease this is not the final column of the graph here this is an actual decrease in the propensity of congress to borrow from the social security system this is an effort to stop the raid on social security members can see that that does end right here this year in 1999 the first year we stopped raiding the social security system in order to pay for government that is a trend we want to see continue in fact we want to see this line continue to go down further and build greater surpluses including the social security fund in order to accomplish that we have to exercise some fiscal discipline right now this year in congress that is the debate that is taking place presently between the white house and the congress here is one of the suggestions we came up with as a republican majority to avoid raiding social security as the president has proposed to do we have proposed that of the increase in spending that we have budgeted for this year that we just tighten our belt a little bit for every dollar in federal spending we are asking the federal government to come up the federal bureaucrats and the federal agencies to come up with one cent in savings in efficiency savings in order to help rescue the social security fund and to stop borrowing from the social security system we want to stop that raid we think that out of every dollar that is spent in washington we can find that one cent in savings and continue to run the legitimate programs and the legitimate services that are needed and necessary under our federal system and do it in a way that allows us to save social security at the same time that is what that one penny on the dollar represents when we suggested this idea folks over at the white house almost had a heart attack they said one penny on the dollar we cannot possibly come up with one penny on the dollar in savings because that would cripple the federal government finding this one cent in savings therein lies the difference between the republican majority in washington and the liberal democrat leadership that we find down at the white house we believe that the government can do what every american family does every day work a little harder to find that one cent savings to just simply start realizing that we can be more efficient and more effective with a whole assortment of federal programs to find that one cent again it was a little frustrating but not surprising here in washington to hear the various cabinet secretaries say we cannot find that one penny on the dollar all of the federal departments are so efficient so lean so effective so accountable with their dollars that we cannot possibly find the savings necessary to save social security so we as members of congress decided that we would take it upon ourselves to help that is the point of todays special order i appreciate members going through that brief history with me about how it is we came to the position we are in it is a very relevant and important position to consider because at this very moment the impasse in passing a budget hinges on the difference of opinion between this congress and that white house to find that one penny and do it in a way that honors and respects not only the taxpayers of america but the children of america who rely on a sound and credibly run government and certainly the seniors the current retirees who rely on social security there are a number of great examples one of our colleagues who i have been told was planning on joining us here issued a report out of his committee and that report lists assuming i can put my fingers on it lists just agency by agency the savings that can be found here are some good examples here is the gentleman from california who has arrived in his report he e2319 suggested that we could find savings in the department of agriculture he cited examples in the department of defense the department of defense spent nearly 40 billion on programs for 15 overseas telecommunications systems that cannot be fully used because the department failed to obtain proper certifications and approvals from the host nations that is according to a 1999 inspector general report we found savings in the department of education 3 3 in loan guarantees for defaulted student loans according to one general accounting office audit there is more we will talk about more of that today he found savings in the energy department in the health and human services department administration and so on and so forth it is not hard to find savings to find that one penny if you are devoted to rolling up your sleeves and doing the hard work of finding the money it is an important proposition i suggest for this congress and for the white house rather than fighting over the relative merit of saving one penny out of a dollar to save social security we ought to be joining in partnership and rolling up our sleeves together and getting down in the trenches at the department of education in the department of defense over at the department of energy over in health and human services and working together cooperatively to find all the efficiencies and savings that we possibly can to build a credible government for the future security of our children and for our nation i yield to the gentleman from california who has led the house through this investigation of where these funds may be found and pointed not only me but other colleagues in the direction that we ought to look in order to find some of these savings"],

to explain what is going on here i have been involved in mobility around houston for 20 years i have been involved in the regional mobility plan and in developing that plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston should be decided by the whole community as things stand today houstonians cannot make an informed decision because metro does not have a comprehensive light rail system to take to the voters the

population on the national budget is staggering every year diabetes causes about 24 000 more people to lose their sight 28 000 more people to undergo dialysis or transplantation for kidney failure and 77 000 more people to lose their lives from heart disease these diabetesrelated side effects in combination shorten life expectancy by an estimated 15 years in the year 1999 approximately 800 000 people will be diagnosed with diabetes and the disease will contribute to almost 200 000 deaths in the united states the number of americans with diabetes has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years again a primary reason that the cdc has called it the epidemic of our time the public and private costs of diabetes are enormous an estimated 105 billion annually including over 40 billion a year in federal dollars more then 1 out of every 10 health care dollars in the unitedstates and about 1 out of 4 medicare dollars is spent on diabetes care in new york state almost 600 000 people and 10 of our seniors have been diagnosed with diabetes at an annual public and private cost of about 8 billion diabetes kills one american every 3 minutes and a new case of diabetes is diagnosed in the united states every 40 seconds and unfortunately an estimated 52 million americans have diabetes right now and do not even know it but new research is filled with promise the diabetes research working group created by congress in 1997 has developed a comprehensive plan for future research that would cost 827 million next year congress mandated this study congress has received its mandated report and yet last year we gave 448 million about half of what is called for only 3 percent of the total nih budget for diabetes that is simply 28 per patient that is not enough yet every day research and new technologies are improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment for example current diagnostic methods cannot always detect adult onset diabetes at the earliest stage of the disease but a new technology has been developed that will diagnose adult onset diabetes as much as 5 years earlier than any current method by scanning the eye retina with low intensity florescent light an early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications we need to increase research for diagnosis blood testing is also becoming less obtrusive a continuous glucose monitoring system recently approved by the fda continuously and automatically monitors glucose levels underneath the skin future generations of this device may permit the patient to monitor blood levels and connect to an insulin pump for seamless care a glucowatch a device worn like a wristwatch will test blood levels easily and painlessly this device which is pending fda approval is as successful at blood testing as conventional methods that require pricking the finger multiple times every day and causes only a slight tingling sensation we need to increase research for blood monitoring we also must increase research for treatment for example we are at the brink of developing an ability to inhale insulin rather than inject it into the body multiple times per day another burden for people with diabetes is the need to inject themselves with insulin several new drugs taken orally may reduce the need to take insulin injections one class of drugs called insulin sensitizers helps to lower blood glucose primarily by reducing insulin resistance in muscles other groups of drugs work by suppressing glucose production from the liver increasing insulin production by the pancreas or decreasing sugar absorption from the intestine for those who will still need insulin a power is being developed that can be inhaled so that injections might not be necessary we need to increase research for treatment in juvenile diabetes type 1 insulinroducing cells called islets are destroyed making daily insulin injections necessary the juvenile diabetes foundation jdf has established three centers for islet transportation which will attempt to transplant healthy islets to cure juvenile diabetes and find new ways to prevent transplant rejection and other dangerous sideeffects the nih and the jdf are also

california that we do not have a text of a bill yet despite the associate presss somewhat premature remarks the gentleman from michigan and i have been meeting for many hours with our staffs and we are still negotiating so any text would be premature i would prefer releasing a text when we have one a final one i rise actually to support the gentlewomans motion but first i want to commend the senior senator from utah who is the chairman of the senate committee on the judiciary and chairman of the juvenile justice conference and he has shown tremendous leadership on this issue and has done everything in his power to bring the senate the house and the administration together and hammer out a proposal that can pass both houses of congress and be signed into law he and his staff have put politics aside rolled up their sleeves and sought a solution i also want to thank the speaker of the house and the leadership of this house i have had their constant support and cooperation in finding the appropriate balance of juvenile justice enforcement gun safety and cultural provisions to respond to the horrific violence that plagues our society and finally i want to commend my colleague from michigan the ranking member of the house committee on the judiciary i have had the pleasure of working closely with him over the last few months to resolve the differences in the house over this juvenile justice provision it is worth noting that after 41 2 years we came to a bipartisan agreement on juvenile justice legislation early this year unfortunately that proposal is now wrapped up in a larger package of much more controversial items including gun safety measures i respect the courage of the gentleman from michigan to seek a meaningful resolution to issues that others would rather exploit than solve now the gentlewomans motion calls for background checks at gun shows without loopholes no weakening of current law and improved enforcement of current firearms laws to the gentlewoman i say consider me instructed i can state unequivocally that i support each of these goals since the tragic school shooting at columbine high school in april the committee on the judiciary has been holding hearings and working on legislation to address the growing culture of youth violence and the three goals stated in the gentlewomans motion have been our guiding effort and they were reflected in the legislation we brought to the house floor in june legislation that she and many of her colleagues unfortunately did not support while i support these laudable objectives i do not support using them as a trojan horse for more invidious goals i support mandatory background checks at gun shows without loopholes i do not support eliminating gun shows i agree we should not weaken current law i do not agree that we should allow for a national registry of firearms but as i rise to support the motion i want to make a few points that i think shed important light on the issues that the gentlewomans motion addresses her motion directs that our conference report include a loopholefree system that ensures that no criminals or other prohibited purchasers obtain firearms from nonlicensed persons and federally licensed firearms dealers at gun shows well i hope the gentlewoman knows that current law already requires federallylicensed firearms dealers at gun shows to perform background checks prior to the sale of any firearm and i trust the gentlewoman knows that h r 2122 the legislation the house considered on the floor back in june that addressed gun shows would have required that all vendors at gun shows including nonlicensed vendors perform background checks prior to the sale of any firearm i assume the gentlewoman knows that all of the persons on her list of prohibited purchasers murderers rapists child molesters fugitives from justice undocumented aliens stalkers and batterers are prevented under current law from lawfully purchasing a firearm and does the gentlewoman know that the list of prohibited purchasers under current law is actually much longer than her list all felons not just the few she lists are prohibited purchasers under current law furthermore an individual does not even have to be a felon to be prohibited but merely needs to be under indictment for a felony to be prohibited and the list also includes persons that have been dishonorably discharged and persons who have denounced or renounced their unitedstates citizenship that is all under current law now i want to say that while i will vote for this motion i am concerned about what the gentlewoman means when she calls for a loopholefree system if by that she means mandatory background checks at gun shows prior to the sale of any firearm with no exceptions and no loopholes then i am with her all the way if she means however to define gun shows to include every private gun transaction under the sun then i am not with her that would be a gross incursion of the liberties that lawabiding unitedstates citizens enjoy and would represent an unprecedented degree of big brother and that is why i do not support the socalled lautenberg gun showprovision it goes far beyond requiring mandatory background checks at gun shows permit me to list a few of its excesses its definition of a gun show is so broad that it could include a few family members or neighbors who gathered together to trade firearms it imposed myriad new excessive regulations on gun show organizers seemingly with the aim of driving them out of business including criminal penalties for conduct of persons not within their control it required federally licensed vendors to do the background checks for nonlicensed vendors at gun shows that is for their competitors and it would then impose new regulatory burdens on the federally licensed vendors making it more difficult for them to stay in business and get this it would further allow federal atf agents to search a gun show promoter or a federally licensed vendor without reasonable cause and without a warrant and finally it created a new huge gun control bureaucracy with vast new authority indeed the most oft repeated phrase in the lautenberg provision is as shall be required by regulation from the secretary of the treasury this new gun control bureaucracy would make organizing and participating in a gun show so onerous and costly that it appears to have been designed to shut down gun shows altogether one example is handing to every participant a copy of title 18s gun control regulations and statutes plus a copy of the regulations as such it is my considered view that the lautenberg amendment does not represent reasonable common ground as we continue to work toward reasonable gun control what is reasonable gun control well how about a ban on importing large capacity ammunition clips a requirement for the sale of safety devices with handguns juvenile brady prohibiting juveniles convicted of a violent offense from owning a firearm prohibiting minors from possessing assault weapons and yes mandatory background checks at gun shows before the sale of any firearm this is what we propose the gentlewomans motion also urges the conferees to and i quote include provisions that aid in the enforcement of current laws against criminals who use guns i hope no one misses the point that the motion is concerned about the enforcement of firearms laws already on the books let me say that i share that concern because the administration has been derelict when it comes to firearms enforcement consider the following in 1992 there were 7 048 federal prosecutions of federal firearms violations in 1998 there were only 3 807 such prosecutions this is a reduction of nearly onehalf over the last 3 years the total number of prosecutions of gun criminals has been pitiful during that period there were only 38 prosecutions of juveniles in possession of a handgun that is over 3 years even though juvenile gun violence is way up there were only 22 prosecutions for illegally transferring a handgun to a juvenile there were only 17 prosecutions for possession or discharge of a firearm in a school zone and get this only one brady act violation or background check prosecution in 3 years now some can argue that the numbers fail to point out the states are doing a better job well even if the states are picking up some of the slack it does not diminish the fact that the federal government has been prosecuting less and less federal prosecutions mean less prison time by gun criminals because the federal system is the toughest in the nation i also wonder if the gentlewoman is aware that the mccollum amendment to h r 1501 which passed the house in june included the armed criminal apprehension program this program was precisely designed to in the words of the motion aid in the enforcement of current laws against criminals who use guns the program in the mccollum amendment required the justice department to establish an armed criminal apprehension program in each unitedstates attorneys office under the program every unitedstates attorney would designate one or more federal prosecutors to prosecute firearms offenses and coordinate with state and local authorities for more effective enforcement in conclusion let me say i wholeheartedly agree that enforcement of current gun laws has become a national problem even a national disgrace i am glad the gentlewomans motion makes the point and calls for improved enforcement efforts i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9952384233474731,

we ought to have a meeting we ought to discuss these things we ought to settle them i would point out parenthetically that paragraph number 2 common sense gun safety measure that prevent felons fugitives and stalkers from obtaining firearms and children from getting access to guns is already the law the brady bill the brady law title 18 section 922 g already prohibits fugitives stalkers and felons from buying or possessing a gun and children already cannot buy handguns i am proposing in my offer a ban on assault weapons being available to youngsters now i have been proposing a gun control bill for many many months last november 4 i sent a copy of it to the gentleman from missouri and we have been talking about it on and off for lo these many months the proposal that i have offered accepts the trigger lock requirement in fact as a standalone bill it passed 311115 a juvenile brady that says if a juvenile commits a disqualifying crime they will never be eligible for a gun that passed 39527 we passed a ban on these large ammunition clips 10 cartridges or more that passed by voice vote and then we had a prohibition on juveniles from possessing assault weapons which i mentioned earlier that passed 25469 so we have already passed these things we could have the makings of a decent gun bill there is one sticking point and that is the socalled gun show loophole now we are confronted with two versions of a solution to the gun show loophole we have the solution of the gentleman from michigan out here which is in my humble opinion unacceptable because it limits the instant check time to one day now we can get 95 percent of the applicants in one day but there is 5 percent that require three business days they are not easily cleared up they are not easily answered and those are the difficult ones those are the ones that may have criminal records those may be the people we do not want to get a gun and therefore we need three business days the gentleman from michigan does not allow that so i cannot accept that now over here we have the other democrat gun show provision and that is by the great senator from new jersey senator lautenberg well his bill literally defines gun shows out of existence he has the three business days that is fine but he also requires such burdensome provisions on people who are conducting a gun show that it is just unsupportable it is too much the other way i propose meeting in the middle a compromise that requires every gun sold at a gun show to have an instant check the purchaser that requires three business days for the 5 percent that we have trouble getting the instant check on and creating a class of instantcheck registrars who are not licensed gun dealers but nonetheless are certified to be able to provide the instant check so the volume can be dealt with now that is a solution that meets the gun show loophole it tightens that existing law gives us the trigger locks gives us a ban on the large ammunition clips gives us a juvenile brady keeps assault weapons from the children what are we waiting for nobody will talk to me the gentleman from michigan has written me a letter saying he will not negotiate with me unless and until the senator calls a meeting of the conferees let us confront him with an accomplished fact a fait accompli let us say here is our proposal now all i need is three

who are singled out based on those parameters are targeted by those that hate others because of who they are because of their gender or orientation or color of skin this should not be permissive in

acts these are acts by despicable people who seek out people based on race gender sexual orientation they are meanspirited and they must be dealt with with the full effect of the law so hopefully we

important to remember at this juncture that this provision is attached to the defense authorization bill and this is the kennedy hate crimes legislation it was not part of the house package it was not considered in the house i say that because i know that we do that in this body where something is considered in the senate it is considered in the conference but it certainly is something that has not been considered and debated in this body i think that makes a difference as we consider this motion to instruct let me first look at what this kennedy amendment in the defense authorization bill provides it is the hate crimes amendment it is what the motion to instruct binds this body to support in the conference it first of all expands the protected groups to include gender sexual orientation or disability now what is important to remember is that we already have a federal crime there is a federal crime to interfere with anyones exercise of a federally protected activity this could be voting this could be traveling interstate commerce exercising any number of federally protected rights it is a federal crime if those rights are interfered with because of race because of color because of religion or ethnicity so that is the current state of the law the kennedy amendment would expand those protected rights to include other categories as i mentioned gender sexual orientation and disability the second point that needs to be made about the kennedy amendment is that it makes it a federal hate crime and it creates the federal hate crime and expands it without the requirement of a federally protected activity this is a significant difference from the current law what we need to remember is that this is a significant substantial expansion of federal jurisdiction over crime in our country it is not always wrong to expand federal jurisdiction as has been pointed out we have done that from time to time in this body but whenever we expand federal jurisdiction we should ask some basic questions first of all is this expansion constitutional that is the responsibility we have secondly if it is constitutional is it necessary is there such a gap in the current law that this expansion is required so we want to talk about those particular questions but before i do i wint to address what the minority leader spoke about how this conduct of targeting minority groups or special groups because of a certain characteristic is intolerable in our society and i agree with that completely in fact when i was a united states attorney i had the responsibility that i did not ask for of prosecuting a hate group that group was known as the covenant the sword and the arm of the lord it was in northern arkansas it was in my district that group led by james ellison had targeted homosexuals it had targeted minorities from jewish americans to african americans they had blown up a jewish synagogue in missouri they had killed a pawnshop owner in texarkana arkansas because they perceived that he was jewish it was clearly a hate group it was a hate group that had violated the law i prosecuted that group at the same time i prosecuted them they had targeted my family for assassination so i know something about hate groups i certainly have not been the victim of racial discrimination i would never say that but i know about hate groups from that experience i see how wrong they are for society i see the poison they are for the new generation coming up we should do everything in our society that is appropriate that we can stand against this we should speak out against it we should express outrage by it and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law i would personally love to be a prosecutor that would go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction prosecuting hate groups and those that engage in hate crimes i think we have to do that so with that background i want to say that targeting any group because of race gender sexual orientation religion or disability should not be tolerated in any civilized society but it should most certainly not be tolerated in the freest country in the world the united states of america but then we come back to the first question and that is is this expansion of federal jurisdiction constitutional we are all aware of the warnings that have been given by the united states supreme court we recall the lopez decision which arose out of our expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction to guns being found in school zones and we said that ought to be a federal crime the united states supreme court said but even these modernera precedents which have expanded congressional power under the commerce clause confirm that that power is subject to outer limits the court has warned that the scope of the interstate commerce power must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce and they continue to warn the congress of the united states to be careful that we do not effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government that is a warning by the united states supreme court they also said in another case we are also familiar with in united states v morrison something i believe in which is an expansion of the violence against women act to create a civil cause of action for criminal conduct that was engaged in because of someones gender which allowed them to bring a civil lawsuit the court struck that law down as well and said the constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local obviously citing the lopez case and recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been consistent since the clause was adopted the regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities channels or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the states so clearly we have some warnings from the supreme court is it constitutional they have raised some questions about it the washington post not exactly a conservative journal editorialized and said rape murder and assault no matter what prejudice motivates the perpetrator are presumptively local matters in which the federal government should intervene only when it has a pressing interest the fact that hatred lurks behind a violent incident is not in our view an adequate federal interest a constitutional warning by the washington post so certainly there should be some questions about is this the right direction to go constitutionally secondly even if we say that it is is it necessary i would point out and i am pleased with this that our federal sentencing guidelines based upon the direction given by the united states congress they have enhanced the penalties for hate crimes but they have done it after the conviction when it is appropriate to consider the targeting of a minority group as a factor in increasing penalties this is what the federal sentencing guidelines says if the finder of fact at trial the court at sentencing determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally selected any victim or any property as the object of the offense of conviction because of the actual or perceived race color religion national origin ethnicity gender disability or sexual orientation of any person the penalty should be increased by three levels and as we all know that is a significant increase in the amount of time that they would be incarcerated so the current state of the law is that the targeting of these special groups is a significant federal factor in enhancing punishment that is right that is appropriate but that is a different scheme than making a special federal statute that would give special protection to certain groups the second thing i would point out is it necessary is what are the states doing in the current prosecutorial scheme the minority leader mentioned the cries of the mother of matthew shepard calling that this is not to be tolerated in our society and how we should honor the victims of violence and we should honor them but in matthew shepards case a homosexual college student as my colleagues know that was murdered in laramie wyoming it was a state court prosecution in which one the defendants pled guilty and got two consecutive life sentences they might create a federal hate crimes statute that they will not get any more than that and the other could be facing the death penalty when it is tried in october another one the murder of james byrd a horrendous crime in texas targeting an african american it was a state prosecution in which the jury gave death by injection rather than life in prison and so it was the ultimate punishment that was meted out in this case under a state prosecution in alabama there was a slaying of billy jack gaither who was beaten to death and then burned by kerosenesoaked tires the men who murdered a homosexual over unwanted advances that perpetrator will avoid the death penalty only because the family requested that the death penalty be waived that was a state prosecution i could go on and on in which state prosecutions have been successful not in 40 years not in 50 years but in the maximum penalty in these particular cases true and i am delighted that in many of those instances federal resources have been devoted to make sure that they were able to obtain the conviction of the perpetrator finally i would point out the testimony of a judge who testified in the senate committee on the judiciary on this particular bill in this case it was judge richard arcara who testified in opposition to the hate crimes legislation and he stated the issue is not whether we are for or against the prosecution of hate crimes all decent rightthinking people abhor hate crimes the real issue before you is whether the acts of violence covered by the proposed statute which are already criminal offenses under state law and which may already be federal crimes as well are not being adequately prosecuted and punished at the present time in other words why is a new federal statute needed and so again the question is it constitutional and secondly if it is is it necessary under the present circumstances the reason i bring these questions up is that my colleagues might conclude ultimately after we debate this that the answer is yes yes and we need to do this but is the appropriate time to consider it in a conference report which is not being considered by the house in fact we are instructing the conferees to go to this particular kennedy proposal when in fact there is also the hatch proposal senator hatch offered a proposal that was adopted as well and it addresses hate crimes but it does it in this way it creates more funding for the states and their prosecution of hate crimes so it gives more resources and grants to the states the second thing it does in a very thoughtful way is that it creates a study to examine the efficacy of the current law do we really need it is it necessary and this is another approach so i would say let us do not bind ourconferees that they have to go a particular direction there are other options that should be considered so my fellow colleagues i believe that there are some important questions that say let us do not adopt this binding motion to instruct our conferees finally i think there is an issue of fairness that troubles some people should certain groups in america when it comes to crimes of violence be entitled to greater resources in investigation and different laws in the prosecution than other groups this is fundamental it is difficult because we all know that there is a problem in our society when we target minority groups or groups that are targeted because of disability or any other reason they should be punished to the full extent of the law and we need to send a signal to our society that it is not tolerable but there are ways to send that signal rather than considering a massive expansion of federal jurisdiction my colleagues these are serious issues and i do not believe the right place to approach it would be in the conference we need to come back and sort through each of these as the supreme court has directed so i would ask my colleagues to oppose the motion to instruct i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9857424134388566, 0.014257586561143398, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i was asked about 15 minutes ago to manage this bill we apparently on this committee could not find anyone to manage this piece of legislation no one thought it was significant enough to take the time to manage so i kind of am stuck with this responsibility my understanding of this legislation is that right now on the w2 forms there is an aggregate number of the fica tax and the hi tax and what this basically will do will break it up into employer employee taxes now bear in mind that the information is already provided by the social security administration beginning this year the social security administration will be sending out on an annual basis to everybody that pays the payroll tax the aggregate amount over the lifetime of the individual of both the hi tax and the payroll tax the fica tax and broken down from management or the employer and employee side so that information is provided there is no secrecy involved in it it will be provided to every taxpayer every employee on a lifetime basis every year so there is no secret to it in fact what this will do is probably put an additional small burden on the employer because now the employer perhaps will have to go back to the computers and make some adjustments but i guess that is not an unfunded mandate although i am not quite sure it could be an unfunded mandate but i do not think anybody will object to it because it is not that big of a deal most employers will probably be able to do it i might also say just to have no misunderstandings about this that we are not going to oppose this legislation the more information to the public the better off we are and if breaking it down from employer employee side gives more information to the average citizen more to it the only problem is that i did hear on the other side as i was coming in that the whole issue of true costs then people will be able to figure out the real true costs and obviously rate of return they are going to get but this really will not have any relevance to that because i have done a lot of studies on social security and the fact of the matter is that right now the overhead costs on ones social security benefits the money coming in and going out is about 1 percent we have done some studies had some hearings in the committee on ways and means the subcommittee on social security and we find that actually the costs of maintenance if one privatizes and actually invests in the private market is about 20 percent because there are fund managers and all of that and we are not going to put that on that w2 form because that would be too much trouble then once there are the aggregate benefits in the trust fund and one is ready to retire then they have to amortize the account that will cost another 20 percent so we are talking anywhere from 35 40 maybe even 45 percent in terms of the overall cost if the social security system is privatized whereas the overall cost is 1 percent in terms of the current social security system so this does not give anybody any comparison again as i said the more information the better off we are and so we are not going to oppose this just in conclusion it would be my hope that we begin to focus on the real issue of social security is that how do we deal over the next 35 years with the fact that we are going to have a 25 to 30 percent shortfall in the social security system that is a big issue and we need on a bipartisan basis to come up with a solution to that because that is going to hit us much sooner than we expected the reality is that we cannot leave the uncertainty in the system that we currently have i urge a yea vote on this resolution and i yield back the balance of my time"]], "top_unsure": [[3.4928321838378906e-05, 0.4999650716781616, 0, "i respect that all of us recognize there is a

and infrastructure for yielding this time i would like to commend both the gentleman from pennsylvania the gentleman from minnesota obviously my colleague and chairman of the subcommittee on social security and other members who have been working on this legislation this legislation is supported and sponsored by the association of american railroads which are all the railroads in the united states along with 60 percent of the membership of the railroad labor unions in my opinion it took years and years to put together and for members to vote this down now would be tragic because this would have an impact on 254 000 current employees of the industry and over 700 000 families and individuals that are currently retired this helps widows and widowers who will have a 300 increase in benefits and it will reduce the age of retirement from 62 to 60 the change we made in 1983 and we now need to go back to age 60 so in terms of benefits to the employees and to the industry this is tremendous the reason that there is a cost as the gentleman from michigan has raised as i think the gentleman from florida has indicated there is a onetime cost because what we are doing is we are bringing in government bonds to allow the tier ii part of the system to be invested in the private equity market that is not a violation of social security or anything like that all that is for that is like a private defined benefit pension tier i programs are like social security tier ii is like a private pension system frankly it is the only pension system that the federal government operates because of a historic relationship with the railroad industry and obviously with the employees so the 15 billion will be paid down over time it will not be a continuing obligation to the federal government secondly we received a letter dated the 18th of july 2000 from steven goss the deputy chief actuary of the social security system to harry ballentine the chief actuary and in this letter it indicates that there is no impact at all on the social security trust fund so the gentleman from michigan may want to read this letter who made the allegation that this would diminish the social security trust fund it will have no impact at all according to the actuaries we must pass this legislation this is legislation that will help the railroads and also it will help the employees and

not do that the gentleman from north carolina has discretionary authority over his small company he is the ceo he is the owner he is the president but he is also the congressman he is in washington he

the gentleman from north carolina thought his people ought to have and one denies it arbitrarily and one kills somebody one has to be responsible for those decisions what are they going to do they are going to carry malpractice insurance like the rest of the world has to what is that going to cost fifteen to 20 cents a month per patient but it gives those people that are patients that work for the
