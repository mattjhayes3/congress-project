opportunity to face americans and define for them what kind of country we would like to be i had the pleasure of organizing the congressional childrens caucus a group of about 60 members who have committed to promoting children first in the national agenda we look forward to hearing from mrs tipper gore the wife of the vice president on the mdrch 25 1999 issues of mental health services for children keeping that in mind i am very concerned with the budget as proposed by the majority leadership because our children must face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millennium we have got to invest in children this budget does not children cannot learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending in programs aimed at protecting the interests of children allow me to call the roll a program of which many members of this house have testified that they graduated from head start is being cut 501 million a 10 percent cut the wic program that provides for women infants and children being cut 425 million job corps which has allowed many inner city and rural community youth to find an opportunity out of the seat of degradation cut 141 million child care there is not a time that i go home to my district when women and men parents who say give me the ability to work provide child care and help me provide child care for my children sometimes onethird of their income 119 million the summer youth program where a mother gave me the good news of her young person who had graduated through the

american head start cut 3 8 million child abuse 2 2 million abandoned infants assistance 1 3 million i can only say oppose this majority leadership budget realize that our children are our best investment let us support the democratic alternative and invest in our children i rise in opposition to fy 2000 budget resolution offered by the majoritys leadership i come in the spirit of hershey and bipartisanism i come to request a budget that protects the social security trust fund for americas citizens i rise to request a budget thact will protect the medicare trust fund we must authorize a budget that will protect the social security trust fund while women tend to collect benefits over a longer period than men because of a greater life expectancy women on average receive lower monthly social security benefits since they have lower earnings and are more likely to be widowed or unmarried in retirement the majoritys budget proposal does not protect women or children or the social security trust fund under this budget proposalprograms directed toward improving the quality of life for women and children are the first programs to be reduced and cut in order to give a tax break to the wealthy the majority is suggesting that their budget proposal will save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment and to modernize public schools educating americas children should be our number one priority our children must be prepared to face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millenium children can not learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending and programs aimed at protecting the interest of our children 425 1 million would be slashed from the wic budget head start would becut by approximately 501 4 million ard liheap funding would be reduced by 109 million nevertheless the majoritys budget resolution reserves 800 billion for tax cuts we must authorize a budget that will protect and extend the medicare trust fund this budget must ensure that patients will have access to high quality healthcare by guaranteeing important protections such as access to the specialists coverage for emergency medical services and affording prescriptions for seniors the majoritys budget proposal leaves the medicare trust fund in a precarious position and its future in question the congressional budget office has estimated that

[0.0, 1.0, 1, "it is not my intention to use the entire hour this evening i wanted to spend some time though talking about hmo reform or managed care reform one of the things that i want to really stress is that there is a major difference between the approach that the democrats have been taking on the issue of hmo reform versus the approach of the republican leadership a lot of times i worry that americans and our constituents think that what we are proposing on both sides of the aisle is essentially the same and that everyone is trying to do something to protect patients rights during this managed care reform debate but i just think it is important to stress the differences i really feel very strongly that the patients bill of rights the democratic bill that has been put forward and is cosponsored by almost every member on the democratic side really protects patients rights whereas the republican leadership bills that have been put forward both in this congress and in the previous congress really do not do an adequate job of protecting patients and too often look towards the interests of the insurance industry instead in the last session of congress in the last 2 years in 1997 and 1998 there was some debate on the issue of hmo reform but the issue was essentially left unfinished in the 105th congress in the last congress on the house side the democrats patients bill of rights was defeated by just five votes when it came to the floor it was considered on the floor as a substitute to the republican leaderships managed care bill which did pass and which in my opinion was really not a good piece of legislation and did not do anything significant to protect patients in fact the republican leadership in the house has reintroduced a bill in this session of congress that is virtually identical to what it moved last year on the senate side the senate republicans in the socalled help committee approved a managed care bill which really in my opinion is a sham reform bill and does not allow patients to sue the insurance companies but does allow the insurance companies and not the doctors and patients to define what is medically necessary what types of procedures what length of stay what kind of operations would be performed and would be acceptable under an individual insurance policy i just wanted to if i could take a little time this evening to talk about why this republican bill that passed the senate the republican leadership bill in the senate really does not do an adequate job of trying to protect patients rights if you look at the bill that passed the senate or that came out of committee i should say in the senate this year it leaves out more than 100 million americans twothirds of those with private health insurance it fails to grant key protections needed by children women persons with disabilities and others with chronic conditions or special health care needs and it allows medical decisions to continue to be made by insurance company executives instead of by health care professionals and patients the main difference that i have tried to point out between the democrats patients bill of rights and the republican leadership bills that have been sponsored in the house or in the senate really come down to two points and that is that the republican bills really leave it up to the insurance companies to decide what kind of treatment you are going to get and with regard to enforcement they do not have adequate enforcement because if you want to appeal a decision about your treatment that you felt that you should have a particular operation you should be able to stay an extra day or so in the hospital if you try that appeal there is really no process whereby you can appeal the decision of the insurance company and be successful and certainly if you suffer damages you cannot sue for those damages under the republican bill what the democrats tried to do on the senate side in committee in the help committee when this republican hmo bill came up they tried a number of times through amendments to improve the republican bill all those democratic amendments were essentially defeated but i wanted to give you a little idea if i could about the kinds of things that the democrats were trying to do to improve what was essentially a bad bill that did not provide adequate protections for patients in hmos the committee republicans in the senate rejected on a 108 party line vote an amendment by senator ted kennedy to extend the scope of the bill to all privately insured americans as i said the republican bill leaves more than 100 million people unprotected because most of its patient protections are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance and that is selffunded employer plans the committee republicans also rejected on the same 108 party line vote senator kennedys amendment on external appeals again as i mentioned before the republican bill does not create a truly independent external review of plan decisions so if you feel that you are not getting covered adequately and you try to appeal there really is no effective external appeal under the committee bill the republican bill the socalled external review is controlled by the hmos and contains loopholes to allow hmos to delay or prevent patients from appealing a bad medical decision by an hmo bureaucrat many hmo decisions could not even be appealed under the republican bill just to give you another idea of some of the examples i talked about the issue of medical necessity and how it is defined the committee republicans in the senate rejected again on a party line vote 108 an amendment offered by senator kennedy to define the term medical necessity and to prohibit hmos from arbitrarily interfering with medical decisions again just to give you an example of how this operates this amendment would have prevented insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of the treating physician on issues relating to the manner in other words the length of stay in the hospital or the setting inpatient versus outpatient care it would have stopped hmos from overruling doctor and going against accepted and best practices of medicine the committee republicanpassed bill does nothing to protect patients when an insurance company bureaucrat tells them they must have a medical procedure on an outpatient basis or be discharged from the hospital prematurely the republican bill allows hmos to continue to define what is medically necessary giving them the ability to deny promised benefits another example the issue of emergency room care many of my constituents have complained to me that their hmo policy does not allow them to go to the emergency room when they think it is necessary or they have to go to a different hospital that is pretty far away if they want to go to an emergency room they cannot go to the hospital near where they live or where they work well senator murray tried to put in an amendment that again was rejected on a party line vote 108 to strengthen coverage for emergency care under the republican bill it is not clear whether a true prudent layperson standard applies to all of the plans covered prudent layperson says that if the average prudent person would think it was necessary to go to the emergency room then you can go to whatever emergency room is close by and readily available well many insurance policies many hmos do not allow that and so the democrats are saying we want to have that prudent layperson standard put into the hmo reform bill instead what happened is that in this case again the ability to apply that prudent layperson standard was rejected by the committee and what that means is that under the republican bill there still is no guarantee that you can go to the closest emergency room or that even if you go to the emergency room and later the hmo decides well you really should not have gone because it was not really an emergency that they can just deny coverage and say you shouldnt have gone to the emergency room therefore were not going to pay for the emergency room care another example that i think is important is with regard to specialists many of my constituents complain that their hmo reform bill does not provide them with access to specialists that they may need in a given circumstance senators harein and reed had an amendment to this republican bill that again was rejected along party lines that would ensure that patients have access to needed specialists under the republican bill patients could be charged more for outofnetwork specialty care even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan so if you decide that you want to go to a doctor i will give you an example perhaps you want to go see a pediatrician but as many people know today that for children there are pediatric specialists for different areas of pediatrics under the republican bill if there is nobody that has that specialty and you decide that you want to see that kind of pediatrician for your child then you can go out of the network but you have to pay for it again what we were saying with this democratic amendment is that access to specialty care should be provided outside the hmo if there is no one within the hmo that has that specialty and is part of the network but again that was an amendment that was rejected i will only mention one more effort on the democrats part to try to improve this bad bill if you will and there are many others but i will only mention one other one and that was senator kennedys amendment again rejected on a 108 party line vote with regard to liability the republican bill fails to hold limos accountable when their actions result in injury or death i mentioned this before you cannot sue the republican plan would protect most hmos from liability even when someone becomes disabled or is killed senator kennedys amendment in the democrats patients bill of rights would allow 123 million patients who receive coverage through private employers to hold their hmos and health insurance plans accountable under state laws for their abuses this is one of the loopholes if you will in the current law and that is that if you are not covered by certain state laws and your health insurance comes from your private employer oftentimes you cannot sue we were trying to correct that as well if i could just say that basically what i am trying to point out tonight is that there are major differences here and that when we look at what is happening on the issue of hmo or managed care reform it is obviously important that we have an opportunity in this session of congress to get a vote on this issue one of the criticisms that i have of the republican leadership is that frankly it is now april almost may and they have not even allowed us to have any kind of a vote there has not been any movement in subcommittee in the committee on commerce that i am a member of or in the full committee to bring any kind of hmo or managed care reform to the floor so we need to at least start the movement but when that movement starts and when we do have an opportunity to vote on hmo reform we have to understand that there is a major difference between the patients bill of rights which is being brought forth by the democrats and the republican leadership proposal now you do not have to take my word for it one of the things that i think is important is that we look at some of the commentators and what they are saying about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on this issue but i wanted to read if i could all or some parts of an editorial that appeared in the new york times on saturday april 10 earlier this month that talked about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on the issue of patient rights just about everyone on capitol hill professes interest in producing legislation that protects patients from unfair health insurance practices but the prospect of actually passing meaningful protections as opposed to talking about it is uncertain president clinton tried to whip up support for democratic proposals but the republicans are balking at democratic plans as too burdensome on the managed care industry yet it is the democratic proposals that more fully reflect the recommendations of a presidential advisory commission to improve health plan quality the republican senate bill s 326 sponsored by senator jeffords of vermont is too limited to accomplish that purpose the bill which was approved by the senate help or health education labor and pensions committee on a straight party line vote of 108 contains some consumer protections but it is unacceptable because most of the provisions would apply only to 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers leaving 110 million americans in other plans unprotected the republican bill would grant appeal rights to an additional 75 million privately insured individuals but those rights would be quite restrictive appeals to an external reviewer would be allowed only when an insurer refused to pay for a procedure on the grounds that it was not medically necessary or was experimental critics say this would give health plans power to limit appeals by simply asserting that a denial is not based on medical necessity it would exclude appeals where a plan unilaterally decided that the benefit was not covered under the contract even if medical judgments were involved in that contract interpretation the republican bill does not adequately ensure access to specialty care by allowing a patient to see an outofnetwork specialist if the plan has an insufficient number of specialists available both the senate democratic proposal which has white house support and a bipartisan bill sponsored by senators john chafee joseph lieberman and others would be substantially stronger in allowing external review of coverage disputes and defining medical necessity and in giving enrollees greater rights to take health plans to court the insurance lobby has already embarked on a media blitz to defeat any new regulations as too costly but consumer protections under the democratic plan would increase health plan costs by only 2 8 percent according to congressional budget office estimates made last year health plans should be made to deliver what they promise their enrollees and held accountable when they fail i think that new york times editorial really sums up what i am trying to say tonight which is the fact of the matter is that if the patients bill of rights the democratic patients bill of rights would be substantially stronger in almost every aspect of managed care reform over the republican proposal now i just wanted to briefly mention again the important areas where the patients bill of rights a democratic bill of rights really provides for a very good protection for patients once again and most importantly the democratic patients bill of rights allows doctors and patients rather than insurance company bureaucrats to make medical decisions using the principles of good medicine in addition it would first guarantee access to needed health care specialists the democratic bill provides access to emergency room services when and where the need arises the democratic bill provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped the democrats patients bill of rights gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process and the democratic patients bill of rights assures that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options and not be gagged because the insurance company says that you cannot talk about something that is not covered the patients bill of rights would also assure that women have direct access to ob gyn and finally and almost as important really as the medical necessity issue is that the democrats patients bill of rights provides an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions i sound very partisan this evening and i do not mean to suggest that there are not republican members on the other side of the aisle that are supportive of the patients bill of rights or the types of protections that i think that are needed in a comprehensive hmo reform bill i know that there are members on the other side that would like to see these types of protections provided under the law but the bottom line is that the republican leadership which is in charge of the house keeps producing legislation or keeps proposing legislation both in the house and in the senate that does not adequately protect patients and i think it is very important that we not only move ahead in this session of congress and quickly on hmo reform but that we move ahead with an hmo reform that adequately protects patients rights that is comprehensive and addresses what i consider the major issue that my constituents and most americans seem to be concerned about at this time"],

couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes vote i invite every democrat to join with

the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax

huge disappointment last weeks unveiling of my republican colleagues new budget proved to be more of the same all bad ideas despite predictions of medicare and social security catastrophes looming on the horizon the republican budget does nothing to extend the life of either social security or medicare for even one day but it still manages to siphon 775 billion into tax cuts for the richest americans instead of investing in education health care to prepare this country for the next century like nero the republican budget fiddles while social security and medicare burn the chief actuary of the social security administration has said this budget will have virtually no effect on the date that social security becomes insolvent it will just make sure that it goes broke on schedule that is not me speaking that is the chief actuary of the social security administration in contrast the democratic budget has a lock box which will protect social security until the year 2050 and protect medicare until the year 2020 my republican colleagues propose a plan that is less secure than the democrats and treasury secretary rubin recommended that the president of the united states veto it

had to choose between defense spending and tax cuts what do my colleagues think mr speaker they chose the tax cuts meanwhile the democratic budget still manages to provide some balanced tax cuts and keep our economy from slipping back into deficit the republican budget on the other hand will create a whole new deficit by the year 2014 the democratic budget does more to reduce class size and modernize our schools than the republican budget which will cut spending for head start cut spending for pell grants and cut money for work study the democratic budget protects important programs like

decades the raid on social security has gone on taking over 850 billion in social security funds and spending them on unrelated government programs 168 days ago just over 5 months this house passed my social security lockbox legislation by an overwhelming 416 to 12 vote the passage of this social security lockbox legislation showed that house republicans and democrats agree that social security

our steadfast commitment to protect seniors social security i have great concerns about the recent actions of the clintongore white house and congressional democrats the current budget situation

to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do not believe the federal government can tighten its belt by just 1 percent but the american people know the truth a recent poll conducted by the national taxpayers union revealed let me show my colleagues this poll revealed that over 84 percent of americans believe that there is not just 1 percent waste in government but they felt there was at least 5 percent of waste in unneeded spending in the federal spending surely if 84 percent of the american people believe that there is at least 5 percent of waste the president and the congress can work together to find just 1 percent or one penny of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the federal government the national park service spent 1 million to build an outhouse at glacier national park in montana the expense was explained by the outhouses remote location the outhouse is located nearly 7 miles from the nearest road and it took hundreds of horse trips and more than 800 helicopter drops to get the construction materials to the site another one erroneous medicare payments that waste over 20 billion annually another the department of education maintains a 725 million slush fund which it cannot account for the department of housing and urban development hud estimated it spent 857 million in 1998 in erroneous rent subsidy payments in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the federal government we are all in this together we want to work with the president and vice president gore to find this 1 percent so that we can protect social security dollars we will not however under any circumstances allow the clintongore administration to dip into the social security trust fund to pay for more government spending with that i yield to the gentleman from arizona who serves with me on the committee on ways and means which has jurisdiction over social security"], [5.960464477539062e-07, 0.9999994039535522, 1, "when i was first elected to congress in 1992 i promised my constituents that i would do everything in my power to abstain from the spending spree that had run up the largest budget deficit in american history i consistently voted against irresponsible spending bills and for legislation to balance the budget and bring our fiscal house back to order today were reaping the benefits of our fiscal restraint we are now in our third year of budget surpluses and unprecedented economic progress the united states is enjoying the longest economic expansion in history the lowest poverty rate in twenty years and the lowest unemployment rate since the 1970s whereas in 1992 we suffered under the weight of a 290 billion budget deficit today we are buoyed by a 211 billion surplus and yet it seems that our republican colleagues have forgotten the lessons we learned just eight short years ago and are spending the surpluses as fast as they come in last year the republicans tried to enact their tax cut agenda at a cost of 929 billion over 10 years this sweeping bill failed because it was obvious that such a large package shoved aside all other priorities and put the nations fiscal health in jeopardy this year republicans have devised a more clever political strategy of breaking up their tax agenda allowing them to focus attention on the same attractions of each part of their agenda while obscuring the total cost but the cost is the same so far this year republicans have pushed through tax cuts that would eat up 739 billion of the budget surpluses when you add this to other tax cuts and spending increases they vow to bring up the republicans will have spent 88 billion more than is available once social security and medicare are protected today congress is on its way to invading medicare as well while we are currently in an era of surpluses we must not forget that medicares fiscal future is troubled according to the most recent trustees report part a will begin running cash deficits again by 2010 totaling neariy 7 trillion by 2040 despite these looming deficits the republicans have introduced yet another tax cut that robs the medicare program of roughly 100 billion in dedicated revenues over the next ten years and 464 billion through 2024 the social security benefits tax relief act repeals a portion of the tax on social security benefits thereby eliminating a dedicated source of revenues to the medicare trust fund without this income medicare part a will go into the red again five years earlier than under current law the result will be a significant threat to the viability of the medicare program for future generations and an even greater squeeze on hospitals and other health care providers dependent upon medicare payments h r 4865 purports to replace the lost revenue to the medicare trust fund from the projected onbudget surplus however while the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund is guaranteed the budget surplus exists only in projections and faces many other competing demands furthermore the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund would be permanent while the projected budget surpluses are temporary once the projected surpluses run out the medicare trust fund will be left with a large hole unless a future congress is willing to raise taxes or cut other programs perhaps most egregious like other republican tax cuts h r 4865 only benefits the wealthiest americans the national council of senior citizens calls h r 4865 an irresponsible political gesture to upper income persons which will have severe consequences for the social security system and the solvency of the medicare part a trust fund the massive amount of general revenues that would be consumed by this bill will leave fewer resources extending the solvency of the medicare program and creating a medicare prescription drug benefit the democratic substitute amendment on the other hand provides the same tax relief as the republican bill but offers it to more seniors at about half the cost whereas the republican bill only benefits the wealthiest 20 percent of social security recipients the democratic substitute would provide tax relief to 95 percent of seniors rather than eliminating the tax for all seniors the democratic substitute keeps the tax in place for only the very wealthiestsingles earning more than 80 000 and couples earning more than 100 000 a year the democratic substitute is also more fiscally responsible unlike the republican bill the democratic substitute protects social security and medicare by conditioning the tax cut on a certification from the secretary of the treasury that the onbudget surplus is sufficient to replenish the lost tax revenue thus it cant go into effect in years in which there is not enough of an onbudget surplus to replace lost revenues we are at a historic fork in the road if we continue down the path of irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthy there will be nothing left for shoring up medicare and social security enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or paying down the public debt i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the democratic substitute and no on the underlying bill congress must reverse its course and get back on the road to fiscal discipline"], [1.3085958698866307e-06, 1.3085958698866307e-06, 0, "i rise to address the issues of communist chinas efforts to steal our most advanced nuclear secrets their funneling of illegal contributions to president clintons 1996 reelection campaign and how the clinton administration either intentionally or through incompetence has irreparably damaged and compromised the security of every man woman and child in the united states last summer during president clintons trip to china jiang zemin the president of china told him that he had no involvement in campaign fundraising in the united states and president clinton took his word for it in that july 2 1998 press conference president clinton said they looked into that and he was obviously certain and i do believe him that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing and that he could find no evidence that anybody in governmental authority had done that giving illegal campaign contributions to the democratic national committee or the presidents reelection committee why would president clinton say that mr speaker the new york times reported in may that johnny chung was given 300 000 by ms liu chaoying a chinese aerospace executive who is a lieutenant colonel in the peoples liberation army in communist army and her father at one time was the head of the chinese peoples liberation army in april of 1996 27 months before president clintons meeting with president jiang of china sandy berger the head of the national security council was briefed that china had stolen w88 nuclear warhead designs neutron bomb data and that a spy might still be passing secrets to china at los alamos one of our nuclear research facilities now the w88 nuclear warhead design is a miniaturized nuclear warhead and you can put as many as 10 of them on one missile so you can hit 10 cities with one missile launched from china thereby endangering as many as 50 or 60 million americans and the neutron bomb data that kind of information would allow an enemy of the united states communist china to launch a missile at the united states with a neutron bomb warhead and when it explodes kills everybodyin the city but it does not destroy the infrastructure the roads the bridges or the buildings now sandy berger the head of the nsc would have had to have told the president about this why would president clinton say thatc lie beieved president jiang of china on april 8 1999 at a joint press conference with president clinton when communist chinas prime minister zhu rongji was here hp was asked about chinas theft of unitedstates nuclear secrets and prime minister zhu said i have no knowledge whatsoever of any charge of any allegation of espionage or the theft of nuclear technology and i do not believe such story and president clinton responded china is a big country with a big government and i can only say that america is a big country with a big government and occasionally things happen in this country and in this government that i do not know anything about and he was indicating that the stealing of this technology and the illegal campaign contributions thatwere authorized by the leaders of the communist chinese government could have happened without their knowledge if that happens in communist china they either shoot them or put them in prison so it is disingenuous for the president to say that he believed him when he knew full well that this was taking place in july of 1997 a year before his meeting with president jiang and 27 months before his meeting with prime minister zhu the administration acknowledges that nsc director sandy berger briefed the president told him about weaknesses in our nuclear laboratories and about chinas spying so when president clinton met with president jiang and prime minister zhu he had already been briefed by nsc director berger sometime before about the possibility of spying and espionage taking place at our nuclear facilities before the president met with zhu the l a times reported that johnny chung had testified under oath that he was directed to make illegal campaign contributions to the presidents reelection campaign by general ji shengde who met with him three times and ordered that 300 000 be directed to chung for political contributions and that there were other conduits other people that they were working with to get money into the presidents reelection campaign and to the democratic national committee now johnny chung was a friend of the president he was in the white house 50 times he brought other people in communist leaders to meet with the president and he was one of the major conduits of bringing illegal campaign contributions into this country general ji shengde was the head of the chinese communist military intelligence the equivalent of our defense intelligence agency in this country and he was the one that was giving the order to funnel these illegal campaign contributions from communist china into the presidents reelection campaign and into the democrat national committee now why would president clinton suggest that maybe the chinese leadership did not know about the spying at los alamos why would he say that when they do something in china as i said before they either shoot them or throw them in jail now regarding chinese espionage in april of 1996 27 months before president clinton accepted president jiangs denial and 3 years before he suggested that chinas spying might be the fault of big government the department of energys chief of intelligence notra trulock told national security advisor sandy berger the head of the nsc that china had stolen both w88 nuclear warhead designs that is the miniature nuclear warhead that they can put 10 of them on one missile and neutron bomb data that a spy might still be passing those secrets to china from los alamos our nuclear research facility according to energy officials who took part in the meeting and read highly classified materials used to prepare for it sandy berger was also told how the stolen technology could fit int o beijings overall nuclear strategy and how the w88 technology could be used as part of a plan to rely on the mobility of trucklaunched missiles with small warheads to better survive a counternuclear attack by the united states according to the new york times energy officials said the briefing was a culmination of a 5month interagency study of the w88 theft and related issues and it was pretty was a pretty specific briefing one american official who was present said that sandy berger was even told that investigators had identified a prime suspect at los alamos in the theft and would shortly turn their information over to the fbi for a formal criminal inquiry why did sandy berger the head of the nsc appearing on nbcs meet the press last month say the information he was told about 3 years ago was very general and very preliminary why did he say we did not have a suspect in the theft of the w88 technology why did he say that we did not know who we did not really know how and we did not really know what we know at the end of the briefing that i just talked about according to officials that were present notra trulock referred to a report from a chinese source which had been provided to the department of energy by the fbi in march of 1996 over 3 years ago the chinese source indicated that officials inside chinas intelligence service were boasting about how they had just stolen secrets from the uwnited states and had used themto improve beijings neutron bomb the source further suggested that chinese agents solved a 1988 design problem by coming back to the united states in 1995 to steal more secrets the source who in the past has drovided reliable inforirao o ever detailed how the information was transferred from the united states to communist china according to one official the intelligence about the neutron bomb was hot off the press and it was included in the briefing to warn the white house of the possibility of continuing chinese espionage in november of 1996 almost 1 years after first suspecting the theft of nuclear secret from los alamos charles b curtis the deputy secretary for energy ordered a series of security measures to be carried out on a straight timetable during the next several months none of these measures were carried out until september of 1998 almost 2 years later and there was a threat and a strong indication that espionage had taken place and our top secrets were being stolen by the communist chinese why did we wait 2 years why did they not implement those series of security measures in march of 1997 4 months before president clinton was scheduled to visit china the energy departments acting secretary for defense programs victor reis and the acting director for nonproliferation kenneth baker prevented notra trulock when he saw further evidence that the chinese had other ongoing spy operations at the weapons lab and he asked to meet with secretary of energy federico pefia they kept him from briefing secretary pefia for 4 months why in april of 1997 when the fbi requested a wiretap to be put on the phone of the conversations of wen ho lee the chief suspect in the theft of americas w88 miniaturized warhead technology the nuclear technology they were turned down by the justice department why would the justice department turn down this request for electronic technology to be put on this gentlemans phone when they thought and highly suspected and even knew that he was giving top secret nuclear technology to the chinese communists that endangered every man woman and child in this country why would the justice department not allow electronic technology and wiretaps to be put on his phone why and who at the justice department turned down this request this guy was accused of stealing americas most advanced nuclear technology why was this request turned down why in august of 1997 fbi director louis freeh told energy department officials that the bureau did not have enough evidence to arrest wen ho lee but that mr lee could now be removed from his position without harming their investigation and that doe was to determine whether or not to keep lee on since the case was not as important as what damage he might do or continue to do by accessing additional information why did the department of energy keep lee on with fbi approval retaining his security clearances until december of 1998 about 2 years later when he was moved to a nonclassified area and took a lie detector test for the first time why again in 1997 in july a year before his meeting with president jiang and 21 months before his meeting with prime minister zhu sandy berger the head of the nsc received a second detailed briefing about chinas spying and soon after told president clinton about weaknesses at the laboratories and about chinas spying in august of 1997 gary samore the senior national security council official assigned to the china spy case asked now get this asked the cia director to seek an alternative analysis on how china developed its smaller warheads in other words he did not want to talk about them being stolen from los alamos through espionage he wanted to find out an alternative analysis from the cia on how they might have gotten this technology immediately after he gotthis briefing from notra trulock in august of 1997 why when presented with such overwhelming evidence of chinese espionage did gary samore at the national security council seek to downplay the significance of the information asking the cia to come up with another explanation about chinas advances why in may of 1998 notra trulock energy departments director of intelligence was demoted to acting deputy director of intelligence after he made a third report to the energy department inspector general about a steady pattern of suppression of counterintelligence issues somebody was trying to keep a lid on all this mr speaker in july 1998 the same month that president clinton was meeting with chinas president jiang when the house intelligence committee requested an update on the spy case from notra trulock trulock testified that acting energy secretary elizabeth moler ordered him not to go to the panel for fear that the information would be used to attack president clintons china policy why did elizabeth moler do this the chinese thefts of unitedstates nuclear secrets according to paul redmund the cias chief spy hunter were quote far more damaging to national security than aldrich ameshe is the spy who is now in jailand the spying would turn out to be as bad as the rosenbergs now you recall the rosenbergs were the ones who gave nuclear secrets to the russians and the soviet union back during and after world war 11 both of them were executed for giving that nuclear technology to the soviets so that they could build their nuclear missiles that were directed at the united states and he said this mr redmund that this spying would turn out to be as bad or worse or as bad as the rosenberg case you can see how really bad this is at the same time that china was conducting its highly successful espionage operations against the united states the committee on government reform which i chair for 2 years has known about and tracked millions of dollars that were given to the democrat party and the presidents reelection committee that can be directly traced to hong kong macao indonesia south america and communist china long before president clinton met with president jiang and long before he met with prime minister zhu we knew for a long time that chinas head of military intelligence general ji shengde had been pulling the strings for a massive conglomerate called china resources which unitedstates intelligence agencies have said operates fronts for the peoples liberation army in hong kong and worldwide for a long time we have known that china resources has joint ventures with the indonesiabased international firm called the lippo group we have also known that the lippo group is run by mochtar and james riady we have known that the ethnic chinese james riady is a close friend of the presidents and has frequently visited him at the white house he was also instrumental in getting john huang appointed to a very important position at the commerce department and later at the democrat national committee we have known that james riadys chief adviser on political donations was john huang who is a former employee of the lippo group and who accepted this job at the commerce department and then left the commerce department to work at the democrat national committee where with the help of james riady and the lippo group and mochtar he collected nearly 3 million in illegal campaign contributions for the democrat party and the presidents reelection committee we have in our possession checks copies of checks which represent illegal contributions to the democrat party drawn from accounts in the lippo bank which is controlled by the riady family it is now being reported that johnny chung who gave more than 360 000 to the democrat party has told a grand jury that some of the money he contributed to the democrat party came from chinas head of military intelligence the very same people that wanted this nuclear technology general ji shengde general ji is the man in the chinese military most likely to be directing chinas spy operations and most likely to be interested in americas nuclear secrets it now appears that general ji was the mastermind behind chinas efforts to get the clintongore team reelected johnny chung has reportedly told a grand jury he was coordinating efforts to funnel money into the campaign along with others according to general ji is it possible that he was working with john huang and charlie trie as well johnny chung john huang and charlie trie together raised over 3 million in illegal donations that we know of that have been linked to the bank of china it is important to repeat that on july 2 1998 during president clintons trip to china when he was asked to comment on his discussions with president jiang zemin about chinas involvement in campaign fundraising in the united states president clinton said they looked into that and he was obviously certain and i do believe him that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing the illegal contributions and that he could find no evidence that anybody in governmental authority had done that the president said he believed that president clinton at his own press conference on march 19 1998 in response to the question can you assure us the american people that under your watch no valuable secrets were lost and he said quote can i tell you there has been no espionage at the lab since i have been president i can tell you that no one has reported to me they suspect such a thing has occurred on april 8 1999 at a joint press conference with president clinton when chinas prime minister zhu rongji was asked about chinas theft of nuclear secrets zhu said i have no knowledge whatsoever of any charge of any allegation of espionage or the theft of nuclear technology and i dont believe such a story this is the prime minister of china president clinton responded china is a big country with a big government and i can only say that america is a big country with a big government and occasionally things happen in this government that i do not know anything about how could president clinton who knew at least 1 year before meeting with president jiang and probably as early as april of 1996 about chinese spying and had all this information about illegal chinese efforts to funnel money into the 1996 clintongore reelection efforts say i do believe president jiang it is just almost disingenuous it is inconceivable that president clinton did not know about chinas espionage and chinas funneling of illegal contributions into this reelection campaign when he met with prime minister zhu how could the president who had been briefed by sandy berger in july of 1997 and probably as early as april of 1996 about chinese spying suggest that maybe chinas spying was the result of big government and that maybe chinas leadership did not know about their spying at los alamos wen ho lee we know had not only been involved in that spying at least that is what we believe now and he has already taken some lie detector tests and is still under investigation we also know that he called convicted spy peter lee at the livermore laboratories where a neutron bomb was being researched some time ago how could the president say that this was a result of big government it is impossible that the chinese leadership did not know about this spying you get shot in china when you do something like that without telling the leadership on march 7 1997 president clinton said i dont believe you can find any evidence of the fact that i had changed government policy solely because of a contribution in february of 1998 5 months before he met president jiang and 14 months before he met prime minister zhu president clinton ignored strenuous objections from the department of justice which was investigating the loral corporation for an unauthorized technology transfer to china and granted loral a waiver for official transfers of essentially the same missile technology to china that loral was being criminally investigated for giving to china without authorization in 1996 bernard schwartz the chairman of loral corporation contributed over 1 365 million to various democratic accounts including the reelection of the president in a march interview with cnns wolf blitzer when questioned about chinas spying at los alamos vice president gore said the law enforcement agencies pursued it aggressively with our full support on march 14 1999 sandy berger asserted that upon learning of chinas nuclear espionage the administration quote imposed and enforced the strictest controls on china of any country except those for which we have embargoes such as libya end quote if the vice president and nsc director sandy berger are right why after showing deceptive answers in his first lie detector test in december of 1998 did it take the clinton administration another 2 months to give mr lee a second test after failing that second test why did it take them another month to get rid of him why did elizabeth moler who ordered notra trulock not to brief the house intelligence committee say that she could not recall being told about trulocks request for a briefing even when a memorandum from mr trulock concerning the briefing request was found in the safe in her office after she left her job at the energy department if what the vice president and sandy berger say is true why within 2 months after becoming energy secretary in january of 1993 when keith fultz assistant comptroller general with the general accounting office briefed hazel oleary and strongly recommended that the department of energy improve controls over foreign visitors to doe weapons laboratories and urged oleary to seek a further briefing about espionage at doe laboratories from unitedstates intelligence agencies did fultz say that oleary say she did not seem very interested in the matter why according to the washington times did a former contractor for one of the department of energys three nuclear weapons laboratories recall that oleary quote decided in her infinite wisdom to lessen security at the labs nuclear technology is being stolen and she lessened security at the labs the cold war is over the contractor says that she indicated and in mrs olearys mind it was not necessary to have so much money spent on security we did away with the people in actual security guard forces security clearances were deemed virtually unnecessary in all but a very few areas former secure areas were opened up and many documents and files were allowed to be seen which at one time were of a secret or classified nature why according to the washington times did the white house originally tell the cox committee that the president was not told about chinese espionage until 1998 we know he must have knownback as far as 1997 or 1996 when his nsc director sandy berger found out about it why did david leavy spokesman for the national security council explain this discrepancy by saying well after the cox committee process weve remembered more on april 7 1998 speaking at a unitedstates institute for peace event president clinton implied that anyone critical of china was using quote caricatures and exaggerating the chinese threat let me share a portion of the presidents speech according to the record now we hear that china is a country to be feared a growing number of people say that it is the next great threat to our security and our wellbeing they claim it is building up its military machine for aggression and using the profits of our trade to pay for it they urge us therefore to contain china to deny it access to our markets our technology our investment and to bolster the strength of our allies in asia to counter the threat a strong china will pose in the 21st century what about that scenario clearly if it chooses to do so china could pursue such a course pouring much more of its wealth into military might and into traditional great power geopolitics this would rob it of much of its future prosperity and it is far from inevitable that china will choose this path therefore i would argue that we should not make it more likely that china choose this path by acting as if that decision has already been made we have to follow a different course we cannot afford caricatures well the president knew that they had been stealing nuclear secrets from our laboratories our nuclear laboratories neutron bomb technology w88 technology mrving technology for warheads and it had been given to them by a person who worked for the laboratory the president had to know this as far back as early 1997 and yet they kept the man on there for over 2 more years and the president said we do not need to worry about that why is china taking this additional nuclear technology if they do not really need it if they do not have any intentions of using it just a couple of years ago they fired some missiles into the sea of china next to taiwan one of the leading military people in china said that he did not think the united states would worry too much about that because if we got involved we would be much more concerned about los angeles than we would about taiwan the implication was that there might be a threat that they would do something like launching a missile at los angeles if we stuck our nose into the taiwanese issue on march 29 1999 one week before president clintons press conference with chinese prime minister zhu newsweek reported that when the cia recently showed data obtained from its sources on china to a team of nuclear weapons experts they practically fainted these are our nuclear weapons experts and when the cia recently showed that data that was obtained from its sources about chinas stealing of that technology our nuclear weapons guys almost fainted the data much of it written in chinese and never read had been stored in cia computers and forgotten until now it showed that chinese scientists were routinely using phrases descriptions and concepts that came straight out of unitedstates weapons laboratories like los alamos the chinese penetration is total said one official close to the investigation they are deep deep into the labs black programs and black programs are our most sensitive nuclear technology security issues and they are deep deep into them according to our experts newsweek even reported that china may have even recently acquired two unitedstates cruise missiles that failed to detonate during last falls unitedstates attack on terrorist osama bin laden and may be attempting to copy their sophisticated guidance and avoidance avionics technology how can the president say that anyone who is critical of china and the threat are using caricatures over the last 2 years my committee has been conducting an investigation into illegal fundraising including illegal efforts by the chinese to influence our elections we have had 121 people nothing like this in the history of the country 121 people have either taken the fifth amendment or fled the country a number of the most important people on this list are now in communist china when my staff attempted to travel to china to interview some of these people the chinese government denied us visas and said they would arrest anybody we sent over there to investigate this we asked the bank of china to provide us with bank records that would show the origins of millions of dollars in foreign money that was funneled into the presidents reelection committee and the democrat national committee the bank of china has turned us down flat the clinton administration has refused to do anything to help us get this important information when so many people take the fifth amendment or flee the country it is obvious that a lot of laws have been broken the clinton administration failure to investigate chinas funneling of illegal contributions into the clintongore reelection campaign and chinas theft of americas most advanced nuclear secrets are absolute tragedies either intentionally or through its own incompetence the clinton administration has caused irreparable damage to americas national security it has compromised the security of every man woman and child in this country this has to be investigated the american public has a right to know what is going on regarding these illegal campaign contributions and the thefts of our nuclear technology and whether or not there is any connection between the two we can no longer accept the compromise of this nations national security and we intend to pursue it as hard as we possibly can but we need the help of the justice department which has been stonewalling us and we need the administration to give us some assistance as well"], [1.3568782151196501e-06, 1.3568782151196501e-06, 0, "it is my privilege to represent a very diverse district in illinois i represent the south side of chicago and

ones we addressed this year i am often asked by folks whether at a senior citizens center a union hall or a vfw when are the politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund that is a pretty important basic question of course washington has raided the social security trust fund for over 30 years back when lbj was president washington began that process and bad habits are hard to break i am proud to say this republican congress is going to lock away 100 percent of social security revenues for social security only let me point out here what this means and i will compare the republican budget with the clintongore budget on social security the republican budget of course locks away 100 percent of social security for social security i would point out that 137 billion of the social security surplus under our lockbox will stay in social security now the president talks about 62 percent of the surplus for social security and what the president and vice president gore are talking about doing is spending 38 percent of social security on othei things that is what the folks back home call raiding the social security trust fund republicans say 100 percent of social security for social security clintongore they say 62 percent and spend the rest on other things we want to put a stop to that and that is why the lockbox proposal republicans are moving through the congress is so important because it is the first step we should take as we work to save social security let us lock away social security first before we consider any other reforms another question i am often asked is no one ever talks about the national debt let me point out that in this budget this year we are in a position where we are going to be able to pay down 1 8 trillion of the national debt last year we paid off 50 billion this year we are projected to pay off 100 billion of the national debt and under our budget we propose the potential of paying down 1 8 trillion of the national debt saving social security paying down the debt i am also asked at the union halls and the vfws and the other community centers and the grain elevators in the district that i represent when are we going to do something about the tax burden on families today the average family in illinois sends 40 percent of their income to washington and springfield and the local courthouse in taxes the tax burden today for the middle class is at its highest level ever in peacetime history twentyone percent of our gross domestic product goes to washington that is the highest level ever in peacetime history and it is putting a tremendous squeeze on middle class families i believe as we work to lower the tax burden on middle class families we should simplify the tax code we should work to bring fairness to the tax code beginning with the elimination of the marriage tax penalty it is simply wrong that under our tax code 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married let us lower taxes by simplifying the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty let us pay down the national debt and let us save social

michigan for this evenings address few have done as much to express the frustration that we are feeling on this side of the aisle as the gentleman from new jersey has so readily done on a weekly and daily basis here in the house i rise today to express my outrage and my disappointment as a freshman member of this house with the actions or should i say the inaction of this body we are more than twothirds of the way through this session and the republicanled congress has had no major accomplishments this is despite the efforts from within their own party and by democrats working together to pass meaningful hmo reform school construction legislation and even a minimum wage bill instead the republican leadership has been playing games with the budget giving tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country and their special interest friends blocking meaningful attempts at gun safety legislation and taking money away from class size reduction and new teacher initiatives as a freshman i arrived last january prepared for action and believed that with gop promises of less partisanship that we could all work together to help the american people yet the last 10 months have been partisan and without any intelligible agenda instead the special interests and their whims have dominated leaving the american people out in the cold rather than passing a meaningful tax bill complete with estate tax and marriage penalty changes and modest tax cuts the republican leadership pushed through a tax package thatbenefited only the wealthy and corporate special interests almost 1 trillion to the wealthiest in this country in fact if you are not in the top 1 percent of wage earners the tax cuts would not mean anything to you or very very little now maybe all the constituents in republican districts make that kind of money but the working class people in districts like mine do not why not provide a family of four living in a place like new york city a high cost place like new york city in the bronx in queens in my district earning 40 000 annually some tax relief what is wrong with that well it is probably because they will not be contributing to the republican leaderships political action committee this year or next year what about our patients bill of rights we finally voted today on a motion to go to conference on the bipartisan patients bill of rights it has been 4 weeks since the house passed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 275 to 151 the norwooddingell bill the senate appointed conferees back on october 15 and yet it is only today november 2 that the house gop leadership is finally bringing up a motion to go to conference as far as i can see this delay strategy by the gop leadership is their attempt to stop the momentum that was obtained by very strong bipartisan vote in favor of the norwooddingell hmo reform bill why are we stopping what members of your party want what the american people overwhelmingly want why are we stopping it we cannot even get on the runway or get off the charts a prescription drug bill to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to our senior population let me tell you a story that i heard recently i received a letter from two constituents mr and mrs done and gertrude schwartz of long island city in queens he is 89 and she is 84 years of age recently he went to have a prescription filled for his wife he bought 100 tablets of prilosec an extremely popular drug among our seniors it cost him 394 89 394 for 100 tablets of a vitally needed prescription people are making life and death decisions as to whether they will pay the rent buy needed groceries or skip a day of taking a needed prescription drug or simply not buying the prescription drug at all and we are here in congress doing nothing as far as i can see to help them then there is the budget debacle we are 34 days into a new fiscal year and still we do not have a budget what is the republican solution to send the exact same d c appropriations bill that we have seen vetoed twice to the floor again today without removing the riders that caused the vetoes in the first place it makes absolutely no sense to me the republican leadership did not even bring to the floor the laborhhs appropriations bill for a debate they went straight to conference without any democrats represented at all at any point in time but having said all i have said it is education that is most troubling to me we passed ed flex which impacts the elementary and secondary education act before we even considered esea reauthorization then the republican breakup of esea into pieces passing the flawed teacher empowerment act and i want you to know this was not supported by one not one teachers organization we just passed a dramatically underfunded title i bill when crafting tax packages the republican majority will not even consider adding school construction assistance even though our deteriorating school infrastructure and classroom overcrowding is a national crisis then we have social security republicans say they want to save social security well we will just go back to history a little bit here back in 1935 in the early thirties nearly 40 percent of americans were dying in poverty it was a democraticled congress and a democratic president who signed into law the current social security system this despite fierce opposition from the republican party in fact all but one republican in the house voted for a motion to recommit title ii of the bill to conference and would have thereby struck the social security act and killed social security as we know it today only one republican in that entire conference now we are to expect that the republicans are going to protect and save social security something they never wanted in the first place in fact let me just show you some of the comments made by majority leader dic armey when he ran for congress proposing to abolish the social security system ultraconservative economics professor dick armey who has based his campaign on his support for the abolishment of social security the federal minimum wage law the corporate income tax and the federal aid to education that is from united press international october 31 1984 again we see mr armey in 1984 said that social security was a bad retirement and a rotten trick on the american people he continued i think we are going to have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over a period of time see that is the republican side of this issue they never wanted it in the first place i do not see how we can expect them to save it the american people do not want this they do not want a partisan congress living up to its donothing billing i urge you to work with the president and the democratic leadership to craft budget bills we can all support i implore you to let the majority rule and move the bipartisan norwooddingell bill on to the president unchanged finally i want to invite you to come to my district and tell the students that are being taught in closets in hallways tell the children in kindergarten classes with 60 kids and two teachers tell those children going to school in buildings that arestill burning coal that they do not need to have school modernization provisions added to any tax bill now i know there are very decent people on the republican side of the aisle i have had the pleasure to work with so many of them in this my first term in congress and i can call many of them my friends but i am not giving up on the rest of you either but we need to work together we need to end the partisanship and do what is right for the american people and do what is right for the american people today not tomorrow not

distinguished career as a public servant he began his political career in 1940 as a republican precinct committeeman and was appointed to the staff of the ohio attorney generals office in 1950 he then went on to represent the broadway east 55th street area of cleveland as a councilman from 1953 to 1962 he was then elected to countywide office and served as the county auditor for 9 years when he was

perk and also our new senator from ohio george voinovich god love ralph perk he was a republican in the days when being a republican was not very cool his political base was found in clevelands heavily democratic ethnic communities which supported him regardless of party label he won folks over with his heart and his ability to be just like everyone else to connect with his fellow man without pretense if another mayor had turned down a state dinner at the white house because of his wifes bowling engagement it would have been a serious breach of etiquette to ralph perk and the city of cleveland it is a badge of honor mayor perk served as mayor from 1972 to 1977 at a time when the city was developing some financial difficulties but ralph perk was able to work with the federal government and the nixon white house to secure funding to alleviate a number of those difficulties he is credited with establishing a regional sewer district and he is also credited with paying off the bonds using city funds to pay off the bonds of the financially strapped cleveland transit authority to create what is now the greater cleveland regional transit authority although it has been more

colleague the gentleman from colorado for yielding me time and i appreciate his giving me the opportunity tonight to be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now

to have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over time this is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting them in two they are asking if they can get half a prescription filled

tremendously disappointed with the leadership shown or lack of leadership shown by the unitedstates department of agriculture during the entire process that has led up to the publishing of the tmdl rule the total maximum daily load during the entire process there has been much much to be faulted there are serious questions about the science and financial analysis underlying these new water quality regulations proposed by epa recent reports by the general accounting office the society of american foresters and other respected experts have questioned the wisdom of epas proposed rules our colleagues on the committee on transportation and infrastructure have called on the epa to withdraw this rule as have a number of agricultural and environmental groups even usda in their own testimony before the committee on appropriations took strong exception to some of what epa proposed in their tmdl rule although they seem to have tempered that concern somewhat this house has already spoken on this issue with a provision passed by the house in the vahud appropriation bill that does not allow epa to implement the proposed rule in fy now usda has the technical and scientific expertise to review the actions of epa and help guide them toward a reasonable solution that might actually work in the field and that is why the gentleman from arkansas offers this amendment today and why it is very pertinent to the discussion today if the department of agriculture is not willing to use their resources to stand up to epa for the benefit of farmers and ranchers and the environment then we should spend their money helping those same landowners that are already trying to preserve their soil and protect water quality that is the simplistics of this amendment now i find it very frustrating because i happen to have been chairman of the subcommittee on department operations oversight nutrition and forestry when we reorganized usda in 1992 and one of the things we agreed to in this congress and with the administration was that we wanted to improve the ability of usda to be a coequal with other branches of government when it comes to dealing with environmental and food safety issues the problem is that we do not have a coequal when one part of the coequal does not stand up for that which is in their own testimony and also in which they have said we agree so the purpose of this amendment today is pretty simple it is delivering what we hope will be a very strong message to both epa and to usda that common sense must apply and to all of those groups that keep pounding on epa to do things that do not make common sense to require our farmers and ranchers to spend unlimited amounts of money fixing a problem that may not be fixable with any amount of money if we could just come back just come back to a common sense approach in which we recognize that farmers and ranchers want to solve the tmdl problem i certainly in my district have some very serious problems in which all farmers and ranchers are willing to work with reasonable people to come up with a reasonable solution that will solve the problem therefore i am not here today saying we should do nothing but many times doing something is very very detrimental to the very cause in which we are talking and today it is clean water when there is someone within a bureaucracy that so believes they are right that they are completely completely willing to ignore all common sense and forge ahead with requiring paperwork burdens and things that absolutely will not solve the problem in the opinion of everybody but them there is a problem so this amendment is very serious let us put the money where there is an indication that we will have a willingness to solve the problem hopefully though we will have the kind of common sense approach to this question that will lead us to a solution that can be embraced by all certainly that is the desire of farmers and ranchers that i represent in my district in my state and the other 49 states to those out there in epa land listen carefully we want to work with them we do not agree with those of them who believe that the only solution is theirs and they want to do it in the quiet of the night we want to work with them let us work with them quit demanding that it be done only their way"], [0.9860950578004122, 0.013904942199587822, 1, "i thank the

supporters was republican president theodore roosevelt why would he do such a thing well he did not want to have two americas a have and a have not what do we have today in america we have a nation where the top 1 percent of our people the top 1 percent own 40 percent of the nations assets twice the amount held by them in the past 20 years today my friends the house has a choice the democrat plan to reform the estate tax system a reform plan that would leave 99 percent of americans paying no estate tax and still cutting the estate tax for the top 1 percent or the republican plan on the other hand which adds another 40 billion in cost a year in order to eliminate the tax for the top 1 percent my friends i believe that most americans feel that that 40 billion extra would be better spent going to save social security and medicare or paying down our 5 6 trillion national debt which is now being assumed by our children or providing prescription drugs for our seniors strengthening our military fixing our public schools and providing health care for 45 million uninsured americans the time may come when our country can afford to entirely eliminate the estate tax for the top 1

the american people are literally taxed off it has rather been a political process and too easy to tinker with this code which should be thrown out by the way and raise taxes but i want to take issue with the constitutional scholars our founders never intended an income tax i could say on the floor that if they did they would have put a twothirds supermajority and here is why the only revenue in that constitution was in the form of treaties and international trade it carried a twothirds supermajority we went from trade and treaty and taxing on products and imports and threw that out and went

the fiscal year 2001 commerce justice state appropriation bill under the house bill the initiative received zero funding zero funding for tribal courts zero funding for cops grant setaside for indians and zero funding for the new programs proposed by the administration i have been advised that the reason the initiative received zero funding in the house is because the senate will take care of funding the initiative i find this logic troublesome recently i along with several of my colleagues sent a letter to the chairman and senior democratic member of the subcommittee expressing our strong support for the presidents fiscal year 2001 budget request for the department of justice portion of the indian country law enforcement initiative the presidents budget requested 173 3 million for the initiative this figure represents an increase of 81 8 million above the fiscal year 2000 enacted level i believe that increased funding for this initiative is critical in light of the recent information from the justice department that confirms that while national crime is dropping crime rates on indian lands continue to rise in its 1999 report american indians and crime the bureau of justice statistics found that american indians and alaska natives have the highest crime victimization rates in the nation almost twice the rate of the nation as a whole the report revealed that violence against american indian women is higher than other groups american indians suffer the nations highest rate of child abuse the report indicates that indian juveniles in federal custody increased by 50 percent since 1994 the findings for this report serve as the basis for the presidents request for more funding for this initiative i also support the presidents request to make permanent the office of tribal justice under the department of justices associate attorney generals office the attorney general created this office to provide a permanent channel for tribal governments to communicate their concerns to the department and to coordinate policy on indian affairs with the departments in other federal agencies the department of justice and the department of the interior developed the initiative 2 years ago to improve the public safety and criminal justice in indian communities last year congress appropriated 91 2 million to the justice department for additional fbi agents tribal law enforcement officers detention centers juvenile crime programs and tribal courts this year the house provided zero funding for the initiative i urge my colleagues to
