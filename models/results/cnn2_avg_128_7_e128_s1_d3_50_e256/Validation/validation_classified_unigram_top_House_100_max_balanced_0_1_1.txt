francisco at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton and we will talk to her many many times"], [0.0013811588287353516, 0.9986188411712646, 1, "senate concurrent resolution 149 is substantially identical to house concurrent resolution 33 which was ordered reported favorably by the committee on foreign affairs earlier today haiti today once again stands at a crossroads after 2v tumultuous years the haitian people have again gotten back to the point where they may be able to break with the past a past market by repression cruelty and corruption after the downfall of duvalier the people of the united states proved their willingness to help the haitian people in their struggle for economic development and social justice today we stand ready to help again once we know that the hand of tyranny has again been truly thrown off and we are certain that the will of the haitian people will not again be thwarted make no mistake about it this congress likes what it hears general avril saying with the support of the noncommissioned officers and the haitian army general avril and those supporting him have stated their desire to return haiti to the path toward democracy he has reached out beyond the army to involve the opposition leadership and other key groups in a national dialog and that is an important step toward national reconciliation we like what has been done with the removal from office some of the most notorious defenders of the old order determined to halt a transition to democracy the last few weeks have seemingly brought about an almost unbelievable transformation where there was despair there now is hope but we in the united states have learned through harsh experience that the performance of haitis leaders seldom has reflected their democratic rhetoric while we hope and pray that the apparent alignment of the haitian army with the desires of the haitian people will bring a new day united states policy must be based on reality and not expectations if we are to again provide large amounts of assistance to haiti it must be on the basis of haitian government performance toward achieving the goals of liberty justice and prosperity laid down by the haitian people in the constitution they approved overwhelmingly in 1987 general avril has spoken well of democracy but without free open and fair elections there is no democracy it is to be hoped that the new government of haiti will promptly set a date for elections in the not too distant future and that it will establish an electoral process that will have the respect and support of the haitian people the concurrent resolution before us today is offered neither in a spirit of concession or confrontation the resolution sets forth clearly and simply the sense of congress with respect to those goals to which we deem the haitian government must be committed if in behalf of the american people the congress is ever to approve providing assistance to the haitian government today no such assistance is provided it is forbidden by the appropriations law just enacted while assistance to the haitian people continues through private voluntary organizations this resolution would make explicit the intent of congress that aid to the haitian government not be resumed until and unless the government of haiti has taken clear and decisive actions to acheive certain specified goals these are not washingtons goals but goals repeatedly called for by the haitian people themselves what are the steps we expect the haitian government to take to embark on a credible transition to democracy based on the 1937 constitution and announcement of an election date to respect human and civil rights to reform the corrupt bureaucracy to promote economic development and to assure the personal security and right to assembly essential to grassroots development to step up cooperation with us on narcotics trafficking and to demonstrate the militarys willingness to accept civilian rule and to abide by haitis constitution section 2 of the resolution provides that it is further the sense of congress that we not have a regular and sustained assistance relationship with the government until a civilian government has been elected through free and open elections and further provides that no assistance should be given until after there have been full consultations with the congress by the executive branch sectioti 3 of the resolution declares congress support for the aspirations of the haitian people for an elected civilian government and for economic government and urges appropriate committees of congress to take whatever actions they deem appropriate to promote free elections either through positive steps such as assistance or through the enactment of economic sanctions such as those now pending in h r 4152 if progress is not made toward free elections section 4 of the resolution calls on the executive branch to work with our friends and allies to shape a multilateral policy toward haiti this resolution enacts no sanctions it lifts none it is offered at a time of hope and expectation as an expression of our willingness to work with haiti to achieve a democratic and effective government based on values shared by the haitian and american peoples i am confident that if progress in haiti is reflected by concrete actions the congress will give high priority next year to reviewing existing aid restrictions and especially to assure appropriate financial support for elections and a

convert to a democratic form of government yet that is what the sandinistas are asking us to believe they will do now we should be extremely skeptical of the sandinistas intentions in order to protect our own national security interests to help keep other central american governments from being subverted by communism and to help the people of nicaragua who do not want to live under a communist regime if the cnntras are defunded and killedoff the united states and her allies will depend upon soviet cuban and nicaraguan goodwill our insurance and deterrence of further communist expansion will no longer be the nicaraguan resistance but the military of the united states of america i do not think this is wise especially when nicaraguans are now willing to fight their own battles can the sandinista communists be trusted to democratize nicaragua perhaps another question should be asked instead why did they not democratize nicaragua when they came to power 9 years ago when president carter delivered economic aid to what was then billed as a free and democratic movement the reason is that the sandinistas decoived the world about their intentions then and they are deceiving the

needs of children one of the federal governments biggest success stories in its service to children is the head start program i know most of my colleagues are familiar with head start it was originally designed as an 8week summer project under the economic opportunity act it has proved to be one of the most popular effective and enduringof the 1960s antipoverty programs today head start continues to provide comprehensive services to address the health nutrition social and educational needs of some of the nations poorest children and their families at least 90 percent of the children head start serves must be from lowincome families the program also has a mandate to address the special needs of handicapped migrant and indian preschoolers over 91 million children and their families have enjoyed the benefits of head start since the programs inception head start gives disadvantaged children a better chance as they enter school children who have participated in head start and other preschool programs are less likely to require special or remedial education and are more likely to be in the correct grade level for their age a followup of 820 head start children showed gains in school performance lasting as long as 13 years the program also helps parents become more actively involved in their childrens education and development four out of five head start parents offer volunteer services and onethird of all head start staff are parents of current and former students head start has helped to focus the attention of the nation on the importance of early childhood development it has served as a model for many other public private state and local preschool programs and childcare services research has proved that quality preschool programs are a very wise investment not only in terms of developmental gains for children but also in savings to taxpayers the high scope foundations perry preschool study found that the total economic benefits of 1 year of preschool outweigh the costs by 7 to 1 preschool graduates have higher rates of high school graduation and employment and lower rates of arrest and teen pregnancy than their nonpreschool peers i would like to share with you an example of the kind of positive changes head start can effect in the lives of families mrs frankie king a head start parent from auburn al testified at my subcomittees oversight hearing during the 99th congress when her children began participating in head start nearly 20 years ago mrs king had not finished high school she now not only has her ged but a college diploma too she also has moved up the head start employment ladder from volunteer to parent involvement coordinator three of mrs kings six children participated in head start all six have finished college her youngest sona former head startergraduated with honors from the university of florida got a scholarship to the sorbonne to study french and at the time of our hearing was serving as a volunteer teacher with the peace corps in morocco so beyond the educational skills and the social skills and the health screening head start builds confidence nothing hurts a childs selfesteem more than continued failure head start gives a child a chance to succeed not only intellectually but also emotionally if a child is helped to understand his or her dignity that child is more likely to respect the dignity and worth of othersand all society is made safer for many children head start is the first step in their journey toward this understanding and toward selfrespect we have to put more children on that path head start is currently serving only 16 percent of eligible children over 2v million more remain in need last september the congress overwhelmingly approved legislation which i introduced to reauthorize head start through fiscal year 1990 i would urge my colleagues to continue their strong support for head start it is the responsibility of the government to promote

support of this amendment to expedite the eligibility of indigent migrant farmworkers for food stamps i conmend the chairman of the committee mr de la garza and the subcommittee chairman mr paneita for supporting this important amendment i also want to note that this amendment is supported a wide range of organizations which represent farmworkers throughout the united states incuding the farmworkers justice fund the national council of la raza the association of farmworker opportunity programs and the unitedstates catholic conference the united farmworkers of california and texas the farm labor organizing committee of ohio and michigan the east coast farmworkers support network the american friends service committee and cata which represents puerto rican farmworkers in the united states the legislation before us today is intended to assist the victims of drought who are suffering economically as a result of agricultural losses this is a national calamity and it deserves a national response from the congress we need to respond to the economic needs of farmers and those in farmrelated businesses but let us not in our haste ignore the urgent needs of the most vulnerable drought victims americas farmworkers across this nation in ohio in michigan in the farm belt in the southwest there are thousands of homeless jobless and stranded farmworkersmany of them childrenwho are special drought victims they cant lose their farms they own no farms they cant lose their housing they have no housing they cant lose their unemployment benefits and their health care coverage they have none and in addition to homelessness and destitution they face another urgent crisis malnutrition that is something we can do something about today in this legislation that is what this amendment is about this special plight of farmworkers may sound familiar because the congress in 1982 enacted special rules to expedite the processing of food stamp benefits to migrant farmworkers but the reagan administration issued regulations last fall which severely underminded that law leaving thousands of farmworkers stranded without the ability to secure the food stamps they and their children desperately require and for which they are eligible those regulations say that vendor paymentslike emergency housing for destitute farmworkerscount as income and can deprive them of eligibility for food stamps as a result thousands of farmworkers must choose shall they endure homelessness to qualify for food stamps or nutritional deprivation in return for temporary shelter is that what this congress intended is that justice for farmworkers i am reminded of the proposed regulations by the reagan administration to deny supplemental security income benefits to the elderly who own a car or their home those regulations were withdrawn because of protests from elderly groups and their supporters in the congress i remember the refusal of the reagan administration year after year to require sanitation facilities and clean drinking water for farmworkers finally the courts and congress rose up to demand that the rules finally be issued i recall the proposal of governor reagan to reduce food stamp allocations to a pregnant woman because she was providing housing for her baby the courts threw out that twisted logic now in 1988 the reagan administration tells us that the poor family of a migrant worker must choose beween rudimentary housing and food between homelessness and starvation is it possible that we are describing america in 1988 sadly it is all time this amendment will restore the original intent of the congress action in 1982 by excluding emergency housing assistance to destitute migrant and seasonal farmworkers such as housing from designation as food stamp income and it should also be noted that under the law such emergency allocations as fuel car repairs and transportation home must be excluded as well this amendment deserves the support of every member in this chamber this amendment will also assure that migrant farmworkers will receive food stamps for their entire month in which they apply with any overpayments being subsequently deducted this will assure that a destitute farmworker family is able to buy necessary food immediately rather than await the start of a new month throughout this country there may be 50 000 farmworkers or more who are stranded by drought without crops to pick and therefore without an ability to support themselves or to return to their homes i want to commend chairman de la garza for taking the initiative of writing to secretary of labor mclaughlin requesting that she utilize the national activities account to direct emergency transportation and financial support to farmworkers and i call on secretary mclaughlin to act immediately if anyone doubts the emergency nature of this amendment or its appropriateness to the drought relief bill let us recall this fact a field which is not harvested this year will spring back again with next years rain a farmworker family decimated by impoverishment a child deprived of adequate nutrition a pregnant mother denied basic foodsthese drought victims cannot recover with a rainfall they will bear the scars of the drought of 1988 for a lifetime for amelia chavez a single mother of two stranded in liberty center oh for the six members of aurora ruiz family in texas rio grande valley for frank mcqueen a migrant fruit picker in the midwestfor these drought victims who have no voice to speak for them except this congress let us pass

the continuing reports of serious human rights violations in cuba there is no disagreement about cubas human rights record it is one of the few countries in which a political prisoner that is our first amendment generally can be sentenced to 20 years survive the horrors of boniato or combinado del este prison and not be released two decades later even when he has served his entire prison

that treasured spot up here where winston churchill stood and lectured us about central america and he put vietnam out of his ken he does not worry about that any more but he votes i guess because he

1930s the liberal party forthrightly against building up the forthrightly against building up the military power of the british empire even though they knew that hitler was violating the treaty of versailles which was signed in 1918 they came up with this policy under the liberal government when the treaty of versailles was signed it said very clearly that the germans could not build up beyond a 100 000man army and yet what they did was they took the military and built a 100j000man elite corps that was to train millions of other people the liberal party and the british parliament would not ever believe whatwas actually going on before their very eyes the problem is that once a groupof people like the liberals in this body or the liberals in the british parliament get their head set in a certain direction it is almost impossible for them to turnit into another direction the liberal party in england did not change their approach even though hitler started violating the treaty ofversailles and becoming very aggressive with the surrounding countries infact when lord chamberlain flew to munich in 1938 and signed that infamous agreement and came back saying we have peace in our time he had just sown the seeds of world war ii they still were committed to fighting for a disarmament policy and fighting for a paper peace that is what we see on the liberal side of this

particularly to one of our prime economic assets the panama canal therefore my choice is to take those rational steps necessary to deal with that communist threat there are others who disagree they see this situation as one where we the people of the united states are to blame where the communist threat is insignificant and in fact we have heard in this debate earlier today that we ought to learn to trust the communists there and any danger to our security or the security of the embryonic democracies in central america is secondary to the goal of peace even if it threatens freedom why do i say they do not believe there is any real communist threat the democratic study group letter was referred to earlier i have been through the whole letter and there is not one mention made in there of any communist threat in fact the only problem they see in central america in this letter is proverty and maldistribution of wealth something which is strikingly similar to the communist sandinista analysis of what is going on down there it seems to me also that you have got a situation where their measure that they bring forth advocates a position that is necessary to abandon our commitments there and accommodate the communist regime that will inevitably result is that too strong they have a presidential candidate one of our leading presidential candidates who told us recently that we should be willing to accept an inoffensive communist state in central america if my colleagues look at the two reports they will find out that our version of what we should do says and i quote we should put an end to soviet cuban and other communist bloc military or security assistance to advisors in and establishment or use of bases in nicaragua what does their substitute proposal say it says only that what we ought to do is take care of any potential offensive capabilities we ought to accept an inoffensive communist client state in the central american mainland in this hemisphere so what are the choices before us today those who believe that we should take a firm stand against the soviet threat in this hemisphere oppose the bonlor substitute those who believe america is to blame for

assistance on this important measure i thank the gentleman from texas i would like if i may to get back to my eight points very briefly in reclaiming my time because i think if we focus on eight issues very briefly and simply it will help many of our members perceive exactly what all the commotion is about the first of these is the whole issue of understanding this clear distinction between risk notification and hazard communication this morning we were before the rules committee and the distinguished chairman asked of those of us before the committee and gave a hypothetical situation and said would h r 162 resolve the problem when i get a complaint from a worker or a union official that there is some hazard in the workplace and we would like someone to come in from osha to see whether or not our workers are being adequately protected against that hazard or the other example that the chairman gave to us in our testimony before the rules committee he asked what happens when someone phones and says well we have found that there is asbestos in the airconditioning or heating ducts of a building or a school building and we would like some protection for the people in those buildings the answer is that h r 162 does not address that issue h r 162 as reported by the committee does not strengthen the powers of osha in any manner whatsoever relative to protecting workers in the job place that is what hazard communication is about hazard communication is when you have standards in which there are rules relative to climbing ladders chemical exposures weight burdens any number of matters hazard communication involves material data safety sheets the instruction of workers in how to handle those materials the rights of workers in terms of getting adequate training for handling those materials risk notification by comparison does not deal with warning workers and improving the present work environment risk notification seeks to identify those workers who in the pastand emphasize past tensein their former work history in a different era perhaps in many cases prior to osha were exposed to work environments which may in fact have created statistically some risk for them now i am going to come back to that because the jeffordshenry substitute covers each and every one of those workers with risk notification and assistance each and every one of those workers who have up to this point through the department of labor and through niosh been identified as having been exposed to such risk our substitute addresses that population while at the same time not opening up an entire program of retroactive notification with all its medical personnel and liability problems to a potential population of 20 million people but if we understand first of all the difference between risk notification and hazard notification understand that the committee bill does not improve hazard communication the substitute does and understand that the substitute also addresses the issue of risk for those who have thus far been clearly identified through public health and labor department studies as having been exposed to risk in the work placepast tense second we ought to address some of the medical concerns with this bill we ought to point out that the industrial hygienists for example those people who specialize in workplace environments those very professionals who are responsible for occupational safety in the workplace as an organization opposed the risk notification as it came out of the committee that seems to me to be a pretty startling observation further as the gentleman from georgia pointed out the national institute of safety and health opposes the bill as it came out of the committee for the simple reason that it believes the efforts are misdirected and mistargeted in terms of a way in which medicine can best attack the problem of improved occupational safety third we ought to point out that the committee bill establishes a new bureaucracy a new health risk assessment system with the new health risk board and the department of health and human services separate from the department of labor where basically our present worker occupational safety is managed and administered we have the problem just administratively of computing agency jurisdiction and the government once again potentially working against itself fourth is the issue of cost we are told over and over again that the potential cost here is roughly 50 per employee when a risk assessment determination is made and workers have to be notified we asked the general accounting office to project the actual true cost the general accounting office said there are so many unknowns that the cost is incalculable the machine tool industry is the only trade or labor association in all the debate which has examined this issue in terms of trying to cost out the effect of risk notification on its indus try one of those industrial groups in our country today which is suffering under grave economic duress because of foreign competition and changes in the international marketplace the machine tool industry suggests a minimum of 2 to 5 percent impact on the wholesale cost of its manufactured product relative to the cost of notification and health monitoring alone without regard to increased liability exposure and insurance premiums the steel institute the american iron and steel institute one of those industries mostsuffering in disarray in our country estimates the cost as catastrophic in proportion in terms of what it means to the american iron and steel industry then last and i refer again to the remarks of the gentleman from georgia we received an unsolicited letter an unsolicited letter from the former personnel director of the augusta chemical co in augusta ga no longer associated with the firm no special interest in this legislation other than to advise us as to what his experiences were under the niosh experiment in the 1970s and he reports that no the costs were not 50 per employee the costs on the health screening and monitoring thus far have come to 5 000 per employee without regard once again to the hundreds of millions of dollars of liability suits that are still pending fifth the liability issue i would remind members that such distinguished scholars as victor schwartz the author of the famous schwartz and torts the very book that many members of this body used in law school and that is still probably the leading authority on tort law in law schools of the united states today indicates that the bill has serious substantial severe defects in terms of its claim that it has blocked off frivolous lawsuits and difficult and expensive litigation the sponsors of h r 162 maintain that the bill is liability neutral because the certificate by which a worker would be notified that he has been identified as an individual who is at risk that certificate cannot be entered into a court of law that is true the piece of paper cannot the fact of his notification can and there is no privacy on the list of people notified any plaintiff attorney can go down to hhs under this bill and get a computer printout of a thousand people who were notified and my colleagues can see the class action suits starting and see the odd ad hoc settlements one by one 10 000 here 100 000 here perhaps 1 million here in this class action suit and the costs begin to add up to real dollars sixth the issue of preemptions i emphasize this because there have been several dear colleague letters several floor speeches made in which it is uttered that the henryjeffords substitute would preempt state and local right to know or community right to know hazard communication standards which are stronger or more effective in terms of protecting public interests or worker interests than the federal standards that is simply not true it is factually incorrect there are two types of situations one is where you have a state with a state plan a state can have a state plan for hazard communication and community right to know only if its standards exceed those of the federal government the henryjeffords substitute in fact raises those standards it raises the standards in terms of numbers of workers notified it raises the standards in terms of what they are notified and warned about and it also establishes a target risk notification to those whom we now know have been at risk surely if we raise the standards and the states do not raise theirs well yes we will preempt when our substitute offers better protections than existing prevailing state or local work protections but in any instance whether it be a state plan or even a nonstate plan that has a community or state right to know law as opposed to a hazard communication law or a nonstate plan with hazard communication or right to know law above the federal standard that will not be preempted by the substitute that point ought to be reiterated seventh we ought to touch very briefly on some of the issues of business support issues not just of large business it is small business the national federation of independent businesses to the manufacturing association the chamber of commerce the farm bureau the committee bill as it is written makes the family farmer potentially liable for chemicals used on the family farm even with temporary seasonal agricultural workers which the farmer may have employed in past years there are over 300 trade associations professional groups including many public health groups who are opposing the committee bill because of the way it is drawn eighth and finally i would simply once again reiterate the positive benefits of the substitute the substitute is not a bill that seeks to simply do less for the worker in fact what it does is it does more as we contemplate whether or not the nfl football players strike is about to be resolved and hopefully those of us who are football fans will see it resolved prior to the vote on this matter next week we might make an analogy we might ask what if the nfl instead of requiring the players to wear helmets simply had ambulances at each goal post and gave every player an xray after every game and said we give you risk notification this is a hazardous game it is a risky business and because of the risk we will check you out constantly after every game what if they did that as opposed to saying you are going to wear a helmet that is the basic issue once again betweek risk notification and hazard communication what we have sought to do is strengthen helmet protections for the workers to protect them in the first place to prevent those kinds of injuries and occupational diseases that are harmful to them not only that we expand the number of workers and we do it substantially i just have one more point in closing this pertains to some misinformation that continues to be reported on the number of occupational injuries which are in some way workplace related in terms of chemical and hidden hazards you might call them the secret killers we have heard over and over again that upward of 100 000 of our workers every year die because of back risks accumulated risk exposures and upwards of 200 000 300 000 suffer illness every year that report and the report from which those figures have been repeated over and over again were submitted to the office of technology assessment our own congressional office several years ago for review our own office of technology assessment is on record as having repudiated that report repudiated those figures as being utterly void of any scientific foundation and credibility we have tried to make that point but the figures keep coming back i think as a matter of record it is only fair to refer the members to the scientists that we employ at public expense to advise us on such very difficult issues as risk i yield back the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9969227910041809, 0.9969227910041809,

which the secretary may decline to take action have been resolved title ii contains several amendments considered by the house authorizing committees and passed by the senate two of these amendments are of particular importance in my state section 207 of this bill is simllar to h r 4834 legislation which i introduced to authorize alaska native villages and certain oklahoma indian tribes to be eligible for waste treatment grants under the clean water act enactment of this section will allow the necessary waste treatment planning to be done in rural alaska for years to come the amendment would correct a technical error made in the last reauthorization of the clean water act in which alaska native villages were inadvertently omitted from authorization for grants under the act previously both alaska villages and former reservations in oklahoma were eligible for treatment as indian tribes passage of this legislation will correct the error and help to meet the waste treatment needs of these remote communities further section 217 of this bill will provide for a clarification of federal escrow laws pertaining to funds received while lands were being transferred to alaska native corporations pursuant to the alaska native claims settlement act the amendment provides that receipt of proceeds from the sale of wildlife resources is included within the resource categories intended to be deposited into the alaska native escrow fund in july the senate added language to the interior departments appropriations bill that was intended to resolve ambiguity over the longstanding pribilof island alaska native escrow account claim conferees on that measure chose to substitute detailed report language resolving that ambiguity despite their efforts the claim remains unresolved as originally enacted on january 2 1976 the alaska native escrow law provided authority for the government to divert to an escrow account its receipts derived from resources of lands that would pass to natives under the alaska native claims settlement act during the protracted period between the ancsa withdrawals in 1971 and conveyance the government had authority to continue its various revenue generating activities on lands that had been withdrawn for native selection the government was not trespassing at that pointit still owned the land which was in the process of being conveyed to the relevant native corporation the government had authority to collect these receipts under such programs as the mineral leasing act the fur seal act and the laws regarding timber sales in the national forests congress determined that keeping the proceeds was unfair to alaska natives since the government had received its part of the ancsa settlement bargain effective december 18 1971 in fact if the government could have kept the proceeds from withdrawn lands prior to conveyance it would have had a considerable economic incentive to further slow the conveyance process so the escrow account statutes were enacted to direct the proceeds to the native corporation that ultimately received the withdrawn lands much of the land withdrawn for native solection and conveyance had been withdrawn previously for mineral entry wildlife protection forests et cetera congress directed the government to retain in federal ownership within ancsa withdrawals only the smallest practicable tracts necessary for its various purposes the native escrow statutes provide that revenues from lands not so retained would be escrowed various federal agencies over the years have opposed this section 3 e limitation on their interests but in a variety of contexts over the years the department and congress have consistently refused to permit the agencies to limit native property rights arising outside the section 3 e boundaries true in native conveyances federal agencies often retained easements or other access rights over nonsection 3 o lands conveyed but that is irrelevant to the operation of the escrow laws which deal with the period prior to conveyances moreover in cases such as the pribilofs timber sales or the kenai gas field resources were taken extracted or severed a wholly different activity than an access right or easement the escrow fund amendment contained in this legislation definitively states that regardless of any residual access or management rights it may have held reserved or retained pursuant to the fur seal act of 1966 as amended prior to or subsequent to conveyance of lands to the two pribilof village corporations the government did not have authority prior to or subsequent to conveyance to take seals from lands conveyed to the pribilof native village corporation pursuant to ancsa without escrowing the proceeds derived from the harvested seals as enunciated in the statement of managers for the fiscal year 1989 interior appropriations bill the proceeds received by the federal government from its sale of pelts taken from native corporation lands shall be the measure of the principal amount placed in escrow and then distributed h r rep no 100862 100th ong 2d sess 80 1988 it is not just trespass damages which are covered by the escrow statutes the escrow statutes supersede any rights held by the government under the fur seal act to wildlife proceeds from harvests on lands conveyed pursuant to the act in this case of course the act refers to the alaska native claims settlement act the amendment statutorily resolves in the affirmative any possible question as to whether wildlife proceeds are included under the escrow statutes at a minimum for the purposes of the escrow statutes wildlife harvested on lands later conveyed to native corporations pursuant to ancsa is quite simply a resource of land whether it spends time in its life cycle in the air water or ground finally the amendment clarifies any possible ambiguity with regard to the time period within which proceeds received are to be escrowed and distributed to the native corporations the escrow statutes in general provide that the appropriate recipients are to be distributed proceeds derived by the government between the date of withdrawaldecember 18 1971 in most casesand the date of conveyance of ancsa lands decause there might be a time lag between the dale a resource was taken and the date the government received the proceeds from the sale thereof an ambiguity may exist the applicable rules of statutory construction and interpretation as set forth in the statement of managers doi escrow account precedent and the plain meaning of the statutes are all consistent proceeds received during the withdrawaltoconveyance period are to be escrowed and distributed the language in the amendment attached to h r 2677 confirms that position and mandates payments of proceeds received in that period therefore some of the escrow fund proceeds properly due to the pribilof village corporations were derived from seals harvested immediately prior to the passage of ancsa on lands later conveyed to the corporations pursuant to the act at the same time proceeds received after conveyance from seals harvested immediately before conveyance are not subject to escrow i am informed by the secretary of the interior that the governments maximum liability in this claim could exceed 18 million by virtue of this legislation

violation of clause 6 of rule xxi the question remains however is this a general appropriations bill to which the amendment is being offered the precedents indicate that and i quote from 4 hinds precedents section 35663568 an appropriation bill covering several subjects may fairly be considered a general appropriation bill within the privilege conferred by the rule referrlng to what is now clause 4 a of rule 11 which confers on the appropriations committee the privilege to report at any time on general appropriations bills now it is true that the precedents indicate at section 835 of the house rules and manual that a general appropriations bill is not and i quote a joint resolution providing an appropriation for a single government agency and permitting a transfer of a portion of those funds to another agency nor a joint resolution transferring funds already appropriated from one specific agency to another march 6 1980 pp 67167 however in this instance we are not dealing with the mere transfer of funds from one agency to another agency for a single purpose we are dealing with the transfer of funds from the department of defense to both the office of the president and to the agency for international developmenttwo diverse agencies for two distinctive purposes aiding the contras and providing medical relief for noncombatant children while it might be argued that this is for the single purpose of providing assistance and support for peace democracy and reconciliation in central america as the title of the substitute indicates this cannot qualify as a single purpose according to the precedents i cite here procedure in the house 97th congress chapter 25 section 1 2 under the heading general appropriations bills privileged status the precedent reads and i quote the committee on appropriations filed as privileged a joint resolution making supplemental appropriations to two diverse departments for the balance of the fiscal year an examination of the congressional record of the date cited april 22 1975 at pages 1192526 reveals that the resolution in question house joint resolution 407 was in the words of its title a joint resolution making emergency supplemental appropriations for assistance to the republic of south vietnam for the fiscal year ending june 30 1975 and for other purposes specifically the joint resolution appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated 165 million to the department of defense for military assistance to the south vietnamese forces and 165 million to the president for indochina postwar reconstruction assistance in short the earlier precedent is clearly analogous to the present case in which unobligated appropriations are being transferred to two diverse agencies for two distinct forms of assistance in the same country in the former case it was military assistance and reconstruction assistance for vietnam in the present case it is humanitarian assistance for military forces and medical assistance for children in nicaragua had the 1975 joint resolution not been considered a general appropriation bill it could not have been filed as privileged as it was that precedent affirms that a dual purpose bill like this is a general appropriations bill it might be argued that this does not qualify as a general appropriation bill because it also includes legislative and authorizing language but there is no precedent to disqualify this on those grounds our appropriations committee reports numerous legislative provisions in each of its 13 regular appropriations bills so that argument can hardly be used to prove this is not a general appropriations measure however the distinction might be made that had this measure been introduced rather than simply called up as permitted by the rule it would have been referred to several committees as similar measures have been in the past whereas if a regular appropriation bill would be referred exclusively to the appropriations committee under house rules in other words that this is really a hybrid billhalf authorization and half appropriation but such an argument is irrelevant precisely because this has not been introduced and referred the legislative history of clause 6 indicates that it was another protection against unauthorized appropriations because this has not been introduced and referred to the appropriate committee it is all the more important that the clause 6 of rule xxi be available for use to prevent this reappropriation for new purposes without committee scrutiny and keep in mind that clause 6 differs from clause 2 clause 2 of rule xxi applies only to reported appropriations measures clause 6 on the other hand prohibits any general appropriation bill or amendment thereto from being received or considered obviously this anticipates the possibility that a general appropriation bill like this could be received or considered without being reported in conclusion clause 6 deals with one of our most important powers under the constitution the power of the purse we cannot apply a loose interpretation to those purse strings and hope to responsibly manage them i urge that the point of order be sustained 1615"], [0.9721535444259644, 0.9721535444259644, 0, "it is my privilege and honor to welcome to the house of represent atives the reverend j howard cates of fredericksburg va and

myself to sleep i began to see a psychiatrist to help me deal with it on february 2 1984 1 had my first pregnancy aborted in which i was misled to believe that it was my only alternative i was single twentytwo and at the prime of my life i made a phone call to a local clinic i can recall only two questions that were asked 1 what my name was and 2 if this was my first pregnancy i was told that it would cost 245 and to bring cash only i would have to bring someone with me to drive home after the abortion at the doctors office i was led to a room and left alone for ten minutes two medical personnel came in and one of them estimated that i was about three months along i was given a free one month supply of birth control pills and they asked me why i wanted the abortion i answered that i had just moved to maine from arkansas and i felt alone i also thought that it would hurt my parents to know i began to cry i was handed a form to sign i do not recall any of the questions or statements only that i was agreeing to the abortion i was given a shot of valium and was told that the suction method would used causing some discomfort during the abortion i remember wanting to sit up because i was having severe stomach cramps but one of the assistants held my shoulders down i remember that the one who was performing the abortion said its all over with and left the room the assistant told me not to try to stand for awhile and then she left too i sat up and saw a large glass canister it finally dawned on me that my baby was in it i kept saying over and over my god my god

this time a friend and a family member supported me by accepting my situation and by offering a helping hand i later became aware of programs which can assist financially it was knowing that i wasnt

2628 last week the senate passed ilr 2628 with a few minor amendments this bill addresses the problem of ensuring the safety of foreign motor vehicles that are designed to be used in foreign countries but are in fact imported for use into this country these vehicles because they are designed for use in foreign countries do not meet all the safety and emissions standards of our government and are commonly called gray market vehicles the ranking minority member of our subcommittee mr whittaker has worked long and hard for several years to enact legislation in this area and i want to commend him for his efforts as we appear to be reaching the end of our legislative journey the bill requires the secretary of transportation to establish procedures for registering importers of gray market vehicles a registered importer is prohibited from releasing custody of any motor vehicle for use until 30 days after the registered importer certifies that the vehicle complies with all applicable federal safety standards the importer will have to post a bond registered importers will have to attach a label to the gray market vehicle identifying the importer and indicating that the vehicle is a gray market vehicle and the registered importer is responsible for any subsequent notification or remedy of a defect in the vehicle the secretary must periodically inspect a representative number of gray market vehicles that have been certifled to ensure that in fact the vehicles comply with nhtsas safety standards the secretary is empowered to revoke the registration of ary importer who fails to comply with the law one portion of the senate amendment clarifies the vehicle covered by the bill the other portions of the senate amendment are of a technical nature the substantive part of the senate amendment makes it clear that the law will cover imported cars for which there is no comparable u s model the senate amendment is acceptable to me and i urge my colleagues to pass this legislation to help prevent unsafe gray market vehicles from being driven on our highways the amendments provide that an importer petitioning to import a gray market vehicle will have to choose whether to claim that the vhicle is substantially similar to a certified vehicle or to demonstrate by test data or other information that the vehicle can be modified to comply with all applicable federal safety standards if he chooses to claim substantial similarity the importer will have the burden of establishing the vehicles similarity in a public proceeding in accordance with regulations to be issued by the secretary of transportation the record of this proceeding and other information available to the secretary will be the basis for the secretarys determination that the vehicle is substantially similar and that it can be readily modified to conform to federal safety standards if the importer elects not to claim substantial similarity he may submit data from destructive testing or such other data as the secretary may specify to establish that the vehicle can be modified to conform to federal safety standards a positive determination by the secretary will permit the importation of the vehicle model in question both by the petitioning importer and by other importers the permission would relate only to the vehicle model which may be described in the terms and conditions of the secretarys determination for example if the secretary wishes to limit the substantial similarity determination to a particular engine or transmission option within a model designation he could place such a condition on his determination if the vehicle meets any such terms and conditions an importer would be able to import it and to modify it in any appropriate manner that enables him to certify its conformity with the applicable federal safety standards this process is consistent with the intent of the vehicle safety act that manufacturers and importers certify the compliance of their vehicles it is my view that these amendments carry out the intent of the bill and that they should be adopted at the same time i want to be assured that the rulemaking effort under this bill will not slow other rulemaking at nhtsa i am aware that nhtsa has a small rulemaking staff and that it is engaged in other safety rulemaking such as side impact rulemaking this

not favor the senate bill in total but i think that really for two basic reasons i favor this motion to instruct the first one is the amount of money and the second is the flexibility that is represented in the senate bill the flexibility with regard to the job question i do not think anybody in the house feels that we can solve the welfare problem by throwing money at it we have 3 7 million mothers on welfare and if members look at the estimate of what this bill is going to accomplish the house bill it is estimated that in about 4 years we might have gotten 25 000 people into a position of selfsufficiency at a cost of 5 9 billion that would be 150 000 per person it has been said that the money is going to be raised to pay for this bill either at the 5 9 billion or the 2 8 billion level i am certainly not convinced that we have new revenue specific enough to really back that question up and i think that we need to keep in mind the practical facts of the situation in order for a woman with children on welfare to become selfsufficient that woman has to be trained educated to the extent needed and the woman has to have a certain amount of support in day care and transportation or other support medicaid and then that woman has to find a job the job has to pay as least 4 to 5 an hour or the woman is not any better off than she was in the first place i happen to live in an area where there are a tremendous number of men and women working on fulltime 40houraweek jobs right now at 4 an hour a huge number are working at 5 an hour i just think that we have to think in this program of the need to match the training and education to the actual availability of jobs and everybody knows that so that we are not training 10 times the people we are able to place but we need to match we need to match that situation so that we move along state by state locality by locality we find out both what it takes to be successful in that particular area with regard to the support and the time and how long we have to stay with the people how much help they need in advancing to the point where they get selfsufficient i know i am not telling anybody anything they do not know but i think it is going to take once we start this program and we get the states working on it and they are working on it now to some extent it is going to take years until we have a chance of making a sizable bite into the total welfare rolls of 3 7 million people i do not think that we need to be too concerned about the fact thal we might start the program in a more modest way i think it makes sense i think it would be foolish and foolhardy to approach the program and suddenly we are going to do away with welfare it is just not going to happen the jobs are not there the people will require training and we do not know how much support for what length of time it is really going to take with individual women to get them into the position of selfsufficiency for those reasons i am not totally reluctant to support this motion to instruct i think that we ought to approach this program modestly carefully without overly optimistic expectations but approach it and i think the motion
