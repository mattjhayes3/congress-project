eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"], [2.0742416381835938e-05, 0.9999792575836182, 1, "let me first of all pay tribute to the chairman of the committee on the budget the gentleman from oklahoma for really having done a brilliant job in putting together the resolution which was reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this kind of proposal the committee restores 600 million for training grammlatta mainly assumes that the private sector will provide capital resources for highways railroads mass transit longterm scientific research and development and support for the arts and humanities it assumes the private bar will provide legal services for the poor the reason the federal government is involved in these activities is because the private sector cannot or will not afford them in all of these areas the committee assumes that there must be a federal presence equally bad is that grammlatta assumes the kemproth tax cut its obvious inequities aside kemproth is inflationary we need no more proof that the recent rise in interest rates which the administration is now blaming on the federal reserve the committee tax cut is smaller and more oriented to productivity than consumption when the economy declines further the administration will find another scapegoat in the end the american people will put the blame where it belongson poorly conceived and poorly implemented shortsighted reagan policies the real issue is whether we attempt to cut the budget on the backs of the poor the elderly the hungry the unemployed the deprived and the disabled or whether we move in a more equitable and compassionate manner as the committee budget resolution

often make the difference between keeping a home or defaulting on a mortgageto 65 weeks but the administration and its supporters in congress are working to prevent even a minimal extcasion to 52 weeks i am especially concerned that during this coasting period the administration appears to be unaware of the disastrous effect its economic policies have on certain industries by its failure to come to the aid of the ailing housing industry for example the administration literally prevents whole crafts from contributing to our economy i would like to share with my colleagues the results of a recent survey on unemployment in the construction industry conducted by the aflcio building and construction trades department here are the results for pittsburgh pittsburgh pa percent union unemployed asbestos workers 20 boilermakers 60 bricklayers 65 carpenters 48 cement masons 60 floor coverers 25 iron workers 20 laborers 40 operating engineers 23 painters 50 plasterers 77 plumbers 33 roofers 75 sheet metal workers 20 steamfitters 25 nearly 8 out of every 10 roofers and plasterers are out of work 6 out of every 10 bricklayers and cement masons are jobless for those who labor in the construction trades the depression is not something associated with herbert hoover it is more closely linked with ronald reagan i have strongly opposed most of the economic proposals offered by the reagan administration i opposed its budget proposals for fiscal 1982 and 1983 because i feared that a combination of deficit spending and cutbacks in economic development programs and housing construction could lead to a stalled economy the reagan administration and i have a clear philosophical difference on how the government should be run while i do not expect the administration to relent on its basic supplyside approach to government i urge it to take three immediate steps to halt the devestation that is becoming the norm in certain sectors of the economy first the administration should drop its opposition to an extension of unemplpyment benefits we cannot relegate some people to the economic scrap heap while others fortunate enough to gain from the newly enacted tax breaks are living better than ever second the administration should bow to the will of the bipartisan majority of the congress and approve the 3 billion emergency housing assistance contained in the fiscal year 1982 supplemental appropriations bill this mortgage assistance will help bring life to the depressed housing industry by stimulating the construction of thousands of new homes third i ask the administration to join me in expressing strong opposition to the federal reserve boards tight money policies we cannot have economic recovery without the stimulative effect of lower interest rates for those in the construction industry the most important action the government could take would be to bring down the interest rate to 10 to 12 percent we cannot afford to coast much longer robert georgine president of the aflcio building trades department has made an astute observation on what can happen if we do as a result of this rampant lack of jobs many building tradesmen are laying down their tools and leaving the industry altogether the loss of such valuable human resources is irreparable when our nation finally faces up to its needs in housing mass transit and energy supply facilities where will we find the vast number of skilled workers to do the jobworkers and apprentices who are now being discouraged from work ing in the industry for a mighty industrial nation to face the prospect of a lack of capacity in the construction industry is a sober thought indeed it is a prospect i hope the administration considers long and well as it plans

provides an opportunity to open the lines of communcation relative to the economic situation in this nation and the impact of the presidents proposed budget on that situation first of all i would like to go on record as stating that i agree with president reagan and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we are facing a major economic crisis in this nation depending on your socioeconomic vantage point this crisis could be described as a recession or even a depression second i agree that the federal government must act aggressively yet in carefully calculated measures taking into account the wellbeing of all citizens to overcome this crisis this is what i want to address myself to today after reviewing mr reagans speech and the ensuing public relations program so to speak to sell the budget i have formed strong fundamental objections to the reagan administrations prescribed remedy for this economic malaise these objections are not based on any pet projects or socalled sacred cows slashed in the budget but on the very real plight of the poor and lower income people in this nation this budget renders these individuals to being a permanent low priority item on this governments agenda but what we must remember as we consider or propose any budget or economic solution is that the government is designed to serve all of the people of this nation that means that individuals regardless of their economic class are to be served by the federal government what helps one group may very well hinder another group accordingly there is little space for simplistic acrosstheboard remedies the reagan budget in my opinion does not truly address itself to this fact what the president has given to the house and the senate to consider is a budget with a 8 billion cut in spending in fiscal year 1981 and a 41 billion cut in fiscal year 1982 the primary points of the budget call for tax cuts in line with the supply h 602 side economic theory to spur investments and budget cuts to reduce federal spending and combat i ofla~tion in reality the presidents budget gives most of the tax cuts benefits to the higher income people who are already comfortable and most of the spending cuts to programs which affect lowincome people tax cuts may be good news for the well off in our nation but what can a small tax cut do for the unemployed or the underemployed who already have little or no money and are simultaneously asked to bear the brunt of program cutbacks the president says that the cuts are necessary to reduce inflation and the truly needy will not be hurt but ceo as well as noted economists have estmlated that cutting 20 billion from the budget will affect inflation by less than onehalf percent a 50 billion reduction would probably result in a 1 percent reduction in inflation at best with that in mind how can we justify cutting funds to ceta the food stamp program medicaid certain housing programs certain social security benefits unemployment insurance trade adjustment assistance and child nutrition just to name a few when the results in terms of bringing down the inflation rate are minimal we are asking the poor the welfare mother the blue collar worker the elderly and the young to sacrifice for something that will bring us little or no concrete results in the final analy sis to coin the presidents phrase we will be creating a large pool of the truly needythose persons who he says the budget cuts will not hurt additionally the president has preached that the cutting of budget items and giving the states more authority will eliminate fraud waste and abuse of federal funds but it is difficult to see how the fraud and abuse problem is addressed in the reagan economic proposals and so i ask my colleagues how can we pass such budget proposals which callously disregard the needs of a large segment of our countrythe poor last year in the budget committee deliberations i asked that we not balance the budget on the backs of those least able to afford it this time i ask that we not break the backs of those individuals who are poor in the name of economic proposals which have at best only minimal chances of succeedlng instead we must come together and work on a more reasonable solution to our economic crisis i and some of my colleagues who are coumnitted to a f9air deal for those individuals who are all too often voiceless and powerless when decisions like this are made pledge to work for extensive changes in the proposed budget"], [0.0002512335777282715, 0.9997487664222717, 1, "yesterday i shared with you a

official unitedstates coins to commemorate the 1984 summer olympics and raise money for our athletes than a former director of the mint for this reason i would like to direct your attention to a message i have received from another former mint director eva adams president kennedy appointed ms adams as director of the mint in 1961 at the completion of her first 5year term president johnson reappointed her to a second term which she served until august 1969 during her tenure at the mint ms adams launched a successful program to alleviate a nationwide coin shortage and supervised the construction of the new mint in philadelphia through her position on the joint commission on the coinage eva adams was frequently called upon to make recommendations to the president the congress and the secretary of the treasury on coinage and related problems ms adams oversaw the change from silver to clad coinage in 1965 she has received a number of awards for her outstanding work as mint director including the treasury departments exceptional service award in light of this considerable experience ms adams c9mments on the two olympic commemorative coin proposals now before congress are particularly noteworthy in her letter she endorses my bill h r 3879 which calls for a single silver dollar to be sold directly to the public by the mint the former director opposes the other proposal contained in s 1230 and h r 3958 which calls for the minting of numerous coins to be sold through private marketers ms adams objections to this legislation as outlined in her letter are very similar to those i have previously raised s 1230 and h r 3958 call for the minting of 25 different coins i have repeatedly stated my opposition to this provision multiple issues are confusing and discouraging to the buying public and the cost of owning a complete set of coins under this bill would be prohibitive as a result i fear that these coins will not sell ahd that the entire program will end in failure ms adams shares these concerns and worries that this unnecessarily elaborate program would place an unfair burden on the mints facilities as the mint has already been ordered to reduce its budget by 16 percent since the administration suggests that we all do more with less i wonder why s 1230 and h r 3958 suggest that we do less with more ms adams also opposes the private marketing of official unitedstates commemorative coins i believe that this provision will contribute to the high costs consumers will be forced to pay should this program get underway in addition i have frequently questioned the propriety of allowing the consortium of lazardfreres an international investment firm occidental petroleum and the franklin mint to market these coins it is not clear why this contract was made without the benefit of the competitive bidding process and as ms adams reminds us in her letter it was the private marketing of coins that led to the termination of commemorative coinage in 1954 both eva adams and i agree that the 1984 summer olympics should be marked by the minting of a commemorative coin americas olympic athletes have certainly earned our respect and they deserve our financial support however we would like to approve a sensible program to celebrate this event and raise money for our athletes the proposal set forth in s 1230 and h r 3958 is not the best way to achieve these goals i contend that the plan outlined in my bill h r 3879 is a much more realistic proposition former director of the mint eva adams enthusiastically supports my contention i have

economic recoverythe tax cut i would like to take this opportunity to express my unqualified support for the presidents tax plan as reflected in the conablehance bipartisan approach and which is urgently needed if we are to get our economy moving again and to put our nation back on the right track last novemver 4 when the amerclan people voted president reagan into office they did so because they were ready for a change they were and are fed up with high taxes inflation rising unemployment and astronomical interest rates they want a change from the misguided economic policies of the past the old policies of congress and previous administrations have failed the inflation and unemployment which we are experiencing were created by those old policies and are the continuing and visible evidence that more and more spending and more and more taxation will not work due to the failed policies of the past and the resulting inflation unemployment and high interest rates too many americans cannot afford the basic items which their parents could they cannot afford to buy cars or to purchases new homes they cannot afford the high rents of even higher mortgages the homebuilding industry has been forced to a virtual standstill and small businesses are in equally bad shape the small business administration estimated last year that 660 000 small businesses across the country would go under in 1980 yet some would have us continue on as we have done to repeat the mdstakes of the past we cannot and should not repeat those mistakes we cannot spend money which we do not have we cannot pile tax upon tax and say it benefits all americans but we have a choice we have a chance to change the past and the american people know this that is why they voted for a 0f =uge last november why they voted to put a new man in the white house president reagan haa listened to the voice of the american people and has since put forth a program of tax and spending cuts designed to put our country back on the road to economic recovery the centerpiece of the presidents tax program is a 25percentacrosstheboard cut in marginal income tax rates for all american when combined with other elements in the presidents tax package this will help restore the incentive to save and invest thus making more money available for mortgages and business loans this in turn will lead to the creation of more jobs during the past few days and weeks there has been extensive discussion regarding the merits of the various provisions contained in the presidents tax bill versus those contained in the alternative tax plans but that is not the issue the main issue is that the presidents bipartisan tax bill is the only tax plan which will provide real tax relief to all the american people not to one group or another not to some more than others but to all americans there are those wh6 feel however that a tax bill should not be designed for all americans but for groups of special interests let me point out one thing which we have forgotten and the people have remembered the total of all the special interests in america does not equal the public interest slanting tax cuts to favor one group and appealing to political and economic prejudice does not serve all americans yet that is what the opponent of the presidents tax plan have donethe old politics as usual we have proposals before us giving one group of taxpayers a special dea and then increasing taxes for another group in order to fund greater government spending that is wrong and americans know it is wrong and that is why over 500 coloradans called my office in support of the presidents tax plan and why 26 099or 86 percentof those who answered my districtwide questionnaire indicated they favored the presidents tax package the presidents tax cut plan of 25 percent across the board for 3 years followed by indexing is a real and permanent tax cut other plans would actually allow taxes to continue to increase for the american wage earner treasury department calculations show that at least a 22percent reduction in taxes is required by 1984 in order to offset the automatic increases caused by bracket creep and already scheduled hikes in social security payroll taxes therefore a 2year temporary tax cut of 15 percent is no tax cut at all tihe message from the american voters last fall was unmistakably clear the american people want a change in economic policy they want a tax cut as proposed by the administration and they want it now i agree with president reagan that we should not delay any longer in giving working citizens the kind of real tax relief which they want and need the democratic leadership of the house has already toyed too long with the presidents tax cut first the democratic leaders were not sure if any tax cut was necessary therk they decided a tax cut was needed but opposed the idea of a muiltiyear cut and now they support a 2year watered down version of the presidents tax plan with only a tentative cut in the third year i believe the american people deserve better than that they have already suffered too long from the shipshod policies of the federal goverrnent i urge my colleagues to act now to give the american people a breaka real break let us approve the tax plan of the administration which provides a meaningful tax cut for all americans which is designed to increase incentives to work save

members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the american taxpayer ii18319 without a spending limitation members of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other spending programs and facing political disadvantages the political costs of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget

question then is not whether a constitutional amendment should 1 t ed but whether this is the best one possible house joint resolution 350 possesses economic and political virtues vital to the health of the american system the elimination or sharp reduction in deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the

men and women who served during the vietnam conflict the news is full of reports and studies about the thousands who suffer daily from the acute traumas of the war the special day of recognition is very timely therefore in focusing the entire nations attention on the vietnam veterans who fought and still continue to fight a highly unpopular war i heartily support the special day resolution a special day or a week or a month will not heal old wounds however the burden of stress and conflict which so many vietnam veterans carry has been developing over a great many years and may never be completely erased if we are truly to address the problems of many vietnam veteransunemployment family disorders readjustment difficultieswe might pay closer attention to the modest but effective programs that are helping these veterans today operation outreach for example was only created during the 96th congress but it has already proven to be a significant initiative for assisting veterans with stress problems 91 communitybased veterans centers have opened their doors since operation outreach became functional counseling close to 50 000 vietnam veterans the budget for this program has been quite modest and the returns have been substantial unfortunately the administration has proposed to not extend operation outreach past this year as a budget cutting measure i understand that the veterans affairs committee has recommended continued support for the program nontheless and hopefully operation outreach will be maintained this is a small but meaningful way for congress to demonstrate its sincere concern for the vietnam veteran we in congress might also show our concern by developing more responsive means of handling agent orange claims the veterans administration has shown little initiative in coming to terms with this problem despite the fact that many vietnam veterans are suffering physical disorders as a consequence of their exposure to the potent defoliant i have attached at the conclusion of my remarks a press release on this matter in conclusion let us honor the sacrifices made by all vietnam veterans on the special day of recognition and then let us put our commitment to all veterans into action by protecting the programs that assist them news reports indicate that the white house is still unable to find a new administrator for the va it appears that in terms of the treatment of veterans the administration is taking the traditional business as usual attitude it is a crime against those veterans who served so valiantly at this point i include the following news release wasmungton unitedstates rep toby moffett dconn claiming a recent study indicates major problems with the governments handling of agent orange claims expressed dismay over the reagan administrations decision to delay appointing a new head of the veterans administration and to shut down 91 storefront counseling centers the va survey entitled veteran satisfaction with agent orange examination was never publicized according to moffett agent orange is a potent chemical mixture used as a defoliant in the jungles of vietnam one of its main components has been linked with cancer birth defects liver and kidney ailments skin disorders and difficulties with the nervous system the vas own questionnaire moffett asserted shows that viet vets exposed to agent orange are not getting adequate treatment despite the very real concerns of the veterans and despite their continued pressure on the va to help them find answers the va has responded by burying its head in the sand moffett said the inhouse va study indicated three main problem areas va doctors are not discussing the results of their tests with potential agent orange victima many vietera veterans are convinced the va is not giving proper attention to possible agent orange related symptoms the va indirectly is acknowledging the existence of the problem one question is worded have you been seen by a nonva physician because of agent orange problens the va moffett also charged has failed for years to conduct any kind of outreach program related to agent orange has denied public participation in the agent orange decisionmaking process and has failed to develop a meanlingful medical examination in its facilities there seem to be an overriding philosophy that if they ignore the problem long enough it vill simply go away said moffett with the pending shutdown of the 91 counseling centers the lack of a va administrator and the results of the va survey its no wonder that many vietera veterans feel

to the initiative in this house that was so boldly undertaken many months indeed years ago to get the bureaucracy of the federal government under control and to make it more responsible to the desires and wishes of the american people the reason i take this special order and begin this discussion is that for reasons which are unexplained to me and i think unexplainable the initia tives that have been launched in this direction have ground to a silent and mysterious halt someplace in the halls of this house what is regulatory reform all about mr speaker it is a method a means by which the american people seek to regain control over their own government the fact of the matter is that more decisions are made more rules and regulations are issued by unelected officials affecting the lives and the livelihood of all americans than there are as a result of laws passed by the congress of the united states during the average session of a congress somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 laws are passed during that same period of time almost 20 000 rules and regulations can be passed the ratio of those rules and regulations having the force and effect of law on nonelected officials as compared to those made by those elected by the people of the united states is something to contemplate much of the cynicism that the american people feel about their government is a result of the unaccountability of a bureaucracy that is remote insensitive arbitrary and sometimes yes oppressive it was out of this concern that members of congress both in the house and the other body rose up and said that we are going to change this in a bipartisan way members of my party democrats took the initiative in this effort originally to bring the bureaucracy under control through a streamlining and accountability even through the use of the legislative veto which lets members of the congress elected by accountable to the people have the final say so by reviewing and where necessary rejecting and vetoing regulations issued by unelected bureaucrats in 1975 when that issue of legislative veto first came to the floor of this house for a vote up or down on all agencies that should be covered by it 265 members of this house voted in favor if it since that time for reasons again unexplained and unexplainable there has never been an effort made to get that legislation back to this floor for action even though over a majority of the members of this house of both parties have cosponsored legislation to that effect we have amended pieces of legislation on an itembyitem basis to place this mechanism in effect to get control over these unaccountable bureaucrats and it has had an improving impact on our government recently we added this type of control over the federal trade commission different programs in the environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture but the need to make the entire bureaucracy accountable to the american people still remains in years gone past while the house of representatives has moved forward the other body has been reluctant the other body has been the one that has failed to pass this legislation but this year this year the other body by a unanimous vote adopted legislation providing for regulatory reform including a legislative veto what has happened in this house mr speaker what has happened i think is a shame because it reflects upon the members and the leadership of this house what has happened is that although regulatory reform legislation was reported out of the judiciary committee on february 25 of this year that legislationa major bipartisan effort to return control of the bureaucracy to the american peoplehas not yet been able to be voted on by the members of this house the legislative veto legislation h r 1976 which has over 250 cosponsors well over a majority of the members of this house of both parties has yet to be considered in committee or brought to the floor of this house i think it is regrettable that for reasons that cannot be explained there are those in power in this house who have been unwilling to let the voice of the american people be heard who have been unwilling and refuse to understand the force behind more than a majority of the members of this house seeking to have this opportunity to make the bureaucracy accountable and the cynicism of the american people persists about who runs their governmentis it the elected officials or the unelected bureaucrats then that cynicism is understandable and will grow until the members of this house are given the opportunity to do their will and to express the desires of the american people i think you are going to see more and more fingers pointed at the leadership of this house asking the question why is it that legislation which would require accountability on the part of unelected bureauracts is being locked in a closet pigeonholed and not even given the opportunity for consideration i suggest that there are members of this house who in november when the people get an opportunity to go to the polls and express their concerns about the future of this nation are going to hold the leadership of this house and members of this body accountable for once again frustrating the opportunity and the will and the desire of the american people to be heard on this matter what can be so wrong with a piece of legislation that passed the other body by a unanimous vote by people of both conservative and liberal persuasion by the most conservative senators and by the most liberal senators indeed the senators from your own state the commonwealth of massachusetts supported this legislation as it came through the other body what can be wrong with legislation like that that it is not even possible to let the members of this body speaking on behalf of the american people have that chance to bring accountabflity i do not know what you hear when you go to your district but one of the things that i hear is that the american people are fed up with a bureacracy that will not listen with people who control their lives and livelihood whose names they do not know and if they did could not hold them accountable that is not a phenomenon of this administration or the last administration or the administration before that that is a fact of life about the government we have the american people under our system of government are entitled to look to their elected officials and not be put upon solely by the unelected officials yes there are many indeed most of the people in the civil service of this country are dedicated and reasonable and committed individuals many of whom serve at a sacrifice for the american people and consider themselves public servants but there are others who because of this unaccountability have delegated to themselves decisionmaking powers an imposition on the american people that is unwarranted asi said this is not a liberal or a conservative issue some people have suggested that it is an approach that would favor business as opposed to consumers or environmental groups or public interest groups nothing could be further from the truth it is a twoedged sword the voice of the people can be heard through their elected officials when they cannot even get in the front door of many agencies of government there are many regulations which have been issued by this administration undoing the gains and accomplishments in the field of consumer protection or environmental protection but environmentalists and consumer advocates would have had the opportunity to deal with through regulatory reform and legislative veto just as in other instances the excesses of zealots who have gone too far could have been curbed and restrained and made accountable to the american people where those who did not suffer the inconvenience of running for public office have taken it to themselves to pass rules and regulations affecting every aspect of the life of the american public so therefore i appeal to you i urge you bring this legislation to the floor of this house it would take no more than a word from you for this legislation to come forth and let the members of this house work their will upon it on behalf of the american people failing to do that i fear that many members of this house in the elections that are coming up later this year are going to have to answer to the fact why it was that that which was wanted and desired by the american people control over their own government accountability of the federal bureaucracy was not even given the fair opportunity to be votcd on even through a majority of the members of this house have sponsored legislation to do that that is no way to run a democratic institution and if people have to pay a price for that failure of democracy then it is an appropriate price to be paid the american people want their government to be accountable to them it is indeed a government of the people and by the people and in that way it can be a government for the people therefore i urge you do that which the members of your house the members who elected you speaker of their house have asked for let the regulatory reform legislation and the legislative veto opportunity come to this house so that the members can join with their counterparts in the other body pass this legislation and help restore true democratic principles to our government"], [0.9991173148155212, 0.9991173148155212, 0, "i welcome now the opportunity to pay tribute to my friend and colleague from south carolina the honorable ken

history of the issue lndicatts the american willingness to save has substantially decreased over the last 10 years by the end of 1978 the rate of disposable income savings in the united states reached a 30year low of under 5 percentfar less than any other western democracy for example great britain has a 13percent savings rate west germany 15 percent and japan 25 percent each of these countries offers generous tax concessions or government bonuses to savers the importance of savings to productivity and our overall economy cannot be overstated onethird of all the capital in this country is made available through personal savings without adequate savings there cannot be sufficient investments in industry small business and home construction the result is higher consumer prices and increased unemploymnent last year recognizing this critical need to stimulate savings the congress enacted two measures that gradually raised the interest a person could receive on his or her savings deposits and allowed 200 400 for couplesof that interest to be taxfree for a 2year experimental period unfortunately while these two landmark laws represented a positive shift in unitedstates economic policy they have not resulted in any noticeable rise in personal savings interest rates on savings deposits have remained close to their original levels and as feared the 200 400 temporary interest tax exclusion does not seem to be enough of an incentive to save in fact studies show that an estimated 95 percent of all the money saved in america is earned by individuals and businesses whose interest and dividends income exceed the 200 400 limit earlier this year i introduced a bill h r 3049 to remedy this situation my legislation would make permanent the current 200 400 tax exclusion on interest and dividends and raise it to 1 000 2 000 for savings interest only in addition my bill would allow all persons age 65 and over to earn taxfree interest on their savings deposits the conablehance substitute offers similar relief aimed at providing a shortterm and much needed boost to our slumping savings and loan and thrift industry under the terms of this legislation depository institutions would be authorized to issue 1year taxexempt savings certificates they would allow single taxpayers to earn as much as 1 000 2 000 for couplesin taxfree interest the certificates which would cost 500 and above would yield 70 percent of the interest rate on 52week treasury bills and would be available for a 15month period beginning on october 1 the certificate would allow depository institutions to retain and attract many of the investment dollars that have recently gone to competing investment opportunities that currently offer higher returns i might add that these pavings certificates are far more prefprable than a proposal that has been offered to lower the returns on competing money market funds rather than penalizing the small saver by eliminating one of their few opportunities to get a fair market return on his or her dollar additional investment opportunities should be made available the taxexempt savings certificates provide such an opportunity as an original member of the house select aging committee i would like to emphasize however that these taxexempt savings certificates are not the final solution to our nations dismal savings rate especially as it relates to the elderly first the certificates would only be offered for a 15month period allowing the troubled depository institutions to revitalize thermselves over a 2year period but falling to provide any longterm relief for either the institutions or the saver second many senior citizens cannot afford to tie up 500 or more of their savings for a 1year period they depend heavily on their savings to pay for daily living expenses including emergency medical needs under the proposed certificate plan a person would receive stiff interest penalties for withdrawing funds early i favor a more flexible savings incentive plan that would incorporate the taxexempt savings certificate idea with the bill i authored providing acrosstheboard taxfree interest for senior citizens unfortunately i am restricted by the rule from offering such a compromise proposal in the form of an amendment as a result i am supporting the taxexempt certificate plan as the most responsible plan under these circumstances and another major step toward permanent and meaningful small saver relief we must not forget however that savings interest represents nearly 25 percent of the total income for persons age 65 and over in additions twothirds of all savings accounts in the united states belong to persons 5 years and older certainly then any longterm small savers relief should address the special needs of our elderly that is why i continue to offer my bill h r 3049 as an effective solution to the savings rate problem in our nation let me finally express my support for the additional savings incentive contained in the substituteincreased retirement investment opportunities under the conablehance amendment the current 1 500 limit on individual retirement account ira contributionrq would be increased to 2 000 2 250 for couples in addition for the first time employees contributing to an employersponsored pension plan could also claim the 2 000 2 250 ira tax deduction in addition the maximum tax deductible contributions to selfemployment keogh retirement plans would double from 7 500 to 15 000 both of these retirement savings in centives are expected to attract millions of new savings dollars while allowing individuals to plan for a more financially secure retirement simply stated increased savings by americans will do as much to stimulate our economy and increase productivity as any other economic tool the conablehance substitute provides responsible and effective tax incentives for savings and i urge that it be adopted today 9"], [0.9987610578536987,

purchase of the c5 it seems to me when you have the army the navy and the air force and all the people in our committees that are assigned to this job that make a decision based upon the facts that they have before them and upon information about the needs of our armed services that we should stick with them i rise in opposition to the amendment offered to delete the c5b purchase from the 1983 department of defense authorization the airlift issue at the center of this debate has generated many claims and counterclaims over the virtues and shortcomings of the boeing 747 and the lockheed c5b aircraft although the president the secretary of defense the joint chiefs of staff the service secretaries and the house and senate armed services committees have supported the purchase of 50 new lockheed c5s to improve our overall strategic airlift capability we are now being asked to evaluate the relative performance capabilities of the c5 and the 747 for budgetary reasons i do not disagree that there is a need to cut federal expenditures wherever possible in order to ease the strain n the federal budget but to approve the purchase of an airplane that will cost less at the expense of performance capability is very poor defense planning indeed our defense experts have testified that the c5 is the best possible remedy to alleviate our nearterm airlift shortfall since airlift constitutes such an important part of logistics planning the transport airplane used in the airlift is a major determinant for the efficiency and effectiveness of our airlift missions military experts are telling us that if rendered operational under actual emergency circumstances the more efficient and flexible aircraft for rapid deployment would be the c5 the unique features of which make it the best possible plane to do the job in addition the c5 has been improved to better meet our military needs for todays combat situations proponents of the 747 have told us that 48 747s would be equivalent to 50 c5s will save us 6 billion over the next 20 years and will be available for use 3 years earlier at a glance this option would certainly appear to be the more attractive one however the defense experts in closely examining the boeing proposal have informed us that the boeing facts and figures are misleading enough to warrant a much closer look by this body according to the air force the boeing 747 life cycle cost calculations were not done on the same basis as the air force c5 cost calculations and as such do not provide for a fair comparison of the relative costs involved in fact air force price analysts have refuted the 6 billion savings and documented the difference at less than 1 billion over a full 20year cycle of both planes therefore we are really talking about a 900 million difference over 20 years i believe that cost is an important consideration and we should be circumspect and thorough in this regard but we must not lose sight of the basic and overriding concern at the heart of this issue that of military utility while the boeing 747 may cost less in its present capacity as a commercial passenger aircraft the facts will undeniably change if it is to be adapted for military use even if we did add 48 or 55 modified 747s they still would not meet all of the requirements for our military airlift operations boeings own chairman of the board has publicly stated that boeing is not proposing that the 747 be used to carry outsized equipment keeping this in mind i believe our choice of plane seems clear no one can deny that the 747 is a valuable national asset and with modifications would be useful for some deployment missions however the air force has pointed out that a strong civil reserve air fleet modification program through which existing commercial 747s are already available can provide airlift at oneseventh the cost of air force ownership of these aircraft i appreciate that we are and should be very sensitive to the risks and costs of making and selling airplanes in todays economy procurement of 747s would certainly help those who manufacture the aircraft as well as those airlines from which the surplus aircraft would be bought however tempted we may be to aid our ailing industries can we really justify in todays action on this issue relief for some industries or elements of one industry and not provide relief for others we are faced with a decision that affects the mobility deployment effectiveness and response of unitedstates armed forces i cannot stress strongly enough that we are not going to get a bargain if the product we buy cannot do the complete job the 747 will not adequately meet all of our military cargo transport needs and therefore is not cost effective by any measure in closing i urge my colleagues to carefully consider the real issue underlying this debate and support the armed services committee recommendation to buy the c5b and reject the motion favoring the 747"],

1968 to provide for separate offense and consecutive sentencing in felonies involving the use of a firearm or other deadly weapon under current law anyone who uses or carries a firearm when committing a felony as defined by federil law must be sentenced to not less than 1 year and not more than 10 years in addition to the sentenuce imposed for the underlying felony it self under this law it is possible for th~ose convicted to receive a suspended selitence a probationary sentence and also parole second or subsequent convictions require a sentence of an additional 2 to 25 years and the court does not have the discretion to suspend it or impose a probationary sentence howeyer parole is still possible the purpose of my bill is to see that those convicted of carrying a firearm or other deadly weapon do not avoid imprisonment as we have discovered through experience leaving the length of the prison sentence to the discretion of the court often allows offenders to return to society after having received few if any ipcnaltie8 for their crimes free to resume their criminal activity because of the uncertainty of imprisonment the offender knows the chances nre great that even if convicted he will spend little time in prison and once again he will be out on the streets victimizing innocent hardworking productive members of society it is this injustice that i propose to help remedy with my biill the most important provision of h r 35 imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on anyone convicted and it removes the possibility of parole specifically the first time a person is convicted of coznmittinv a felony with the use of a dangerous weapon he would receive not less than a 1year prison sentence which would be served in its entirety in addition to any other sentence for the commission of the crime itself a felon who is convicted a second time would receive a minimum 5year prison term over and above any other prison sentence while these provisions remove any discretion by the judge in sentencing below the minimum or granting a suspended or probationary sentence the court does retain discretion as to thle length of the sentence so long as it remains within the minimum and maximum set by law however and i wish lo stress this point no matter what length the sentence it must be served in its entirety in prison once the sentence has been imposed the judge may not suspend it or any part of it nor may he grant a probationary sentence for any part of it nor may the felon be paroled the number of years the judge declares as sentence in court will be tile number of years served by the felon in prison i do not regard my bill as the soiution to our societys problems with crime i do believe however that my proposal will be more effective in putting those who are a danger to our society in prison than our present system under my proposal the risk of imprisonment is increased by the certainty of punishment whereas under the present law the chance exists that a person convicted of a crime will not have to serve any time at all there is no certainty of punishment and very little risk which might serve to deter unlawful behavior also if penalizing the use of dangerous weapons during the commission of a felony has any deterrent effect at all it could well have a larger effect on deterring crime in general by deterring the use of weapons the law is punishing the criminals means of coercion if he is deterred at all he will be less likely to commit crimes of coercion since he will be less likely to carry a weapon i urge the support of my

that had passed the house before the august recess under the conference agreement the rates for the various appropriation bills will be as follows one billtreasurypostal serviceis continued under section 101 a 3 where the appropriation rate is the lower of the house or senate rate and under the more restrictive authority if an item is not included by one house the rate for that item is the

the more restrictive authority the hudindependent agencies bill is continued at the rate and under the conditions provided in the conference report and joint statement as filed in the house the legislative bill is continued for the full fiscal year as provided in the house bill as reported to the house with certain items funded at specific levels the pay cap is continued for the period of the continuing resolution that is through november 2 1981 in closing i would like to address those members who disagree with one or more of the recommendations in the conference report or the amendments in disagreement there were 47 senate amendments in disagreement it is and was simply not possible to reach agreements on every item that will satisfy every member however the new fiscal year starts at midnight tonight no appropriation bilis have been enacted into law under the ruling of the attorney general and the implementing omb regulations after midnight tonight the only obligations that can be legally incurred absent an enacted appropriation will be for the protection of life and property and for the orderly and prudent termination of government functions this is not the time for individual disagreements it is a time for consensus we must continue government functions at minimum levels and work out individual disagreements on the individual appropriation bills i ask for your support of the conference report in the area of agriculture the senate receded to the house position in amendment no 15 which provides that the secretary of agriculture can exercise the emergency ad thority provided by the house with the passage of h r 4119 the agriculture appropriations act for fiscal year 1982 to combat threats from gypsy moths and fruit flys as well as other pests and diseases this authority provides that the secretary can transfer such funds as he deems necessary from other appropriations and funds available to the department of agriculture to meet such emergencies additionally the managers from the senate will move to concur in an amendment to an amendment of the senate to which the house receded in order to make 93 200 000 available for the elderly feeding program authorized by section 311 of the older americans act and to make available 250 000 000 for guaranteed loans under the rural development insurance fund for alcohol production facilities these funds are to be made available in an expeditious manner under a restructuring of this program provided in h r 4119 house conferees receded to am indment no 16 which directs the economic development administration to maintain the number of economic development representatives in the various states at 47 the amendment further directs that where possible the individuals who held those positions on june 1 1981 should retain their jobs the effect of the amendment is to deny a reorganization request from the eda to eliminate these positions in the defense area both defense and military construction are at fiscal 1981 levels and were not conference items mx deplgyment construction and bomber procurement are not allowed to proceed under the 1981 restrictive language which remains in effect for the life of the continuing resolution the conferees agreed to provide 600 000 for the yorktown bicentennial celebration instead of the 750 000 recommended by the senate no funds were included by the house these funds will be used by the department of defense to proceed with plans and implementation of dod participation in this event it was essential that we include the funds here so their plans can proceed rather than awaiting a final defense appropriation in late november or december the report clarifies house language concerning military pay and allowances by stating our intent that overseas costofliving payments be made at the rate which normally would take effect tomorrow to do otherwise would be unfair finally the conferees agreed on report language allowing the secretary of defense to take necessary steps under existing law to correct the wage rate disparity at the national guard group in wichita kans and other trouble areas if he determines such rates are no longer competitive house conferees accepted senate amendment no 44 which provides 125 million for unitedstates participation in the multinational force and observers in the sinai to meet unitedstates commitments under the camp david agreements while these funds have not yet been authorized an appropriation at this time is essential if this multinational force is to be in place by march 20 1982 as specified by the agreements a provision included prevents these funds from being used for the actual participation of unitedstates troops in this multinational force without prior authorization by congress another provision may be added on the house floor whenamendments in technical disagreement are considered which would limit the amount which could be expended prior to authorization to not more than 20 million this conference report provides that the programs of the department of housing and urban development and independent agencies will be continued at the rate and in the manner provided for in the conference report to the fiscal year 1982 hud appropriations bill report no 97222 which was agreed to in the house on september 15 the conferees were aware of the concern that exists regarding the future of the epa wastewater treatment construction grants program because no funds for this program are included in the fiscal year 1982 hud appropriations conference report the conferees have therefore included language in this conference report reaffirming the intention to make an adequate level of funds available for the epa construction grants program in fiscal year 1982 as soon as the congress has completed work on the pending construction grants reform legislation and upon receipt of the promised administration budget request for this program for the department of the interior and related agencies the continuing resolution would continue the activities of these agencies at the current rate or the rate provided in h r 4035 as passed by the house on july 22 whichever is lower the conferees are agreed on the importance of continuing efforts to fill the strategic petroleum reserve but in keeping with the provisions of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 which was adopted after the house had passed the fiscal year 1982 interior appropriations bill the house accepts the senate amendment providing that funds necessary for oil acquisition and transportation costs related to spro shall be carried off budget the continuing resolution provides for the extension of current law concerning abortion essentially that language says none of the funds made available shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term provided however that the several states are and shall remain free not to fund abortions to the extent th at they in their sole discretion deem appropriate the resolution extends the current law language prohibiting prevention of voluntary prayer programs in public schools the joint resolution provides such sums as may be necessary during fiscal year 1982 for closeout expenses of the community services administration the committee intended that these funds also be available to continue to pay career senior executives of the community services administration as required by law until these senior executives are reassigned the house receded to a technical amendment by the senate concerning the provision of impact aid funds the amendment as accepted relieves the secretary from making impact aid pa yments to school districts within 30 days after the beginning of the fiscal year in an amount equal to 75 percent of the amount they received in the previous fiscal year this amendment was accepted because the appropriation for impact aid for fiscal 1982 will be less than 75 percent of the current years level the conferees made clear however that the secretary shall make payments as needed to those school districts heavily dependent upon impact aid for maintenance and operations of local schools the conferees included in the statement of the managers language that indicated that it is the understanding of the conferees that the resolution contains sufficient funds and authority to operate the office of adolescent pregnancy for the duration of the resolution to maintain the option for congress to consider future funding for the adolescent family life program there is no statement in the conference agreement concerning the public health service hospitals under the rate of operations prescribed by the resolution the secretary would have 25 million available for conversion activities for those hospitals whose conversion plans are approved chairman natcher and senator schmitt agreed during the conference to write the secretary a letter indicating that he should maintain as much flexibility as possible in funding and approving conversion proposals since more funds for conversion might be forthcoming in the fiscal 1982 appropriations bill in regard to pay and related issues the senate rcceded on an amendment no 13 which had proposed a relaxation of the federal pay cap in the house bill to the extent that increases would have been allowed for executive levels iii iv and v the effect of the conferees action is to extend the pay cap for members of congress high executive branch officials and the judiciary through november 20 1981 house conferees receded to the senate on amendment no 35 which eliminates the 25 000 ceiling on honoraria which can be received in any year by federal employees including members of the unitedstates senate house members are limited to 15 percent of congressional salary for such income amendment no 38 also includes language providing a permanent appropriation in future years for ~compensation of members as authorized by law at levels recommended by the president for other federal employees the conferees also agreed to remove the statutory 3 000 limit on living expenses which can be deducted from federal taxes by members of congress while away from home amendment no 46 states that it is the sense of congress that limits on such deductions should be the same as the limits for businessmen and other private citizens on the issue oi the report language which relates to amtrak rail service i must say that i am dismayed with the decision to extend special treatment to the cardinal train this train represents the most political route in the amtrak system it has failed consistently to attain the congressionally required criteria for longhaul trains yet it remains in service for a select few a recent amtrak management recommendation to the amtrak board of directors indicates that this route again fails to meet the performance criteria that we had estatiished in this congress after a great deal of debate in fact the route is projected to attain only 122 passengermiles per trainmile figure the requirement for continuation of this line has been decided by the congress to be no less than 150 the report states it is therefore our judgment that the cardinal should be discontinued it is ludicrous to offer special treatment to this poor performance train at the expense of superior train routes which can better serve the publics traveling needs i am pleased to report that there is no language in this resolution which precludes the secretary of transportation from implementing the washington national airport policy plan the resolution offers the secretary the necessary flexibility regarding implementation as many of you are aware the plan is designed to assure the maximum safety of air operations in the washington area reduce noise and congestion at national airport and encourage the greater use of dulles international airport this longoverdue plan is one which should not be sidetracked by a few special interest groups the policy attempts to balance the competing interests of airlines their passengers congress and the residents of the washington area in developing this equitable plan safety as always was given the highest priority"], [0.9913796186447144,

shortto saudi arabia in return for rumored saudi participation in a regional defense concept with the united states in the persian gulf all of us in the congress must be deeply concerned about the

directly leagues in this special order threatening and unacceptable i remind my colleagues that when there are those who have argued the congress approved the fi5 sale that the sale of armaments in

must art of th etngfoppoask ourselves about the logic of such ts of that diffiureasoning how can we justify adding n t add r new offensive capabilities to a government that has become more unstable indeed the legitimacy of these fears since 1978 the goal of the adminis was demonstrated last year when the trations proposal is to meet the soviet carter administration indicated its inthreat in the middle east but at what terest in granting additional sales price today we have reached a very disturba wellreasoned editorial in this ing point because the administration mornings new york times notes the has publicly announced its willingness problems that the secretary of state to go ahead with selling the additional is facing it says hardware this decision becomes all a few honest words from the saudis the more alarming when viewed in would certainly improve the reagan admin light of recent press reports of tentaistrations case for the proposed arms sales tive plans also to sell the saudis five mr haigs explanations so far have been awacs electronic surveillance planes extremely vague the fact is that he and seven kc135 aerial tankers too is eager to give the saudis almost any i

moderate saudis to take the awacs would give them the the lead in pressing for arab negotia most advanced detection and comh 1356 cc mand aircraft in the world this plane is capable of isolating defense forces with its powerful range and sophisticated computerized techniques the new york times last friday april 3 carried the more ominous news that the saudis might be allowed to keep four awacs now operating there as a result of the iraqi conflict until delivery of five such planes could be made in 1985 the proposed sale of the f15 hardware is particularly distressing in light of the recent history of congressional concern over this matter i certainly acknowledge that the new administration has the prerogative to review and alter policies of the previous administration however given that congress approved the initial sale of the f15s only after strong assurances that they would not be equipped offensively a strong presumption must rest with rejecting any additional sales alteration of this policy would only be justified if international conditions had changed to a sufficient degree to alter previous practices i do not believe these changes have occurred i also do not believe that there are any compelling arguments which justify creating such an unstable condition for israel our most reliable ally in the middle east there has been great concern over soviet expansionism in the persian gulf area i am also greatly concerned by these developments however i do not believe that additional military sales to the saudis will end these soviet efforts in this very volatile region the equipped f15 and awacs would greatly alter the regional balance of power however these sales would not significantly reduce any soviet threat if the soviets make the decision to go beyond afghanistan these f15s and awacs in the entire scope of the world military balance would serve as only a minimal deterrent what could provide a powerful deterrent and have a very positive effect on the region as a whole would be a change in policies by the saudi government to aid the peace effort currently this government has shown no inclination to back away from its support of the plo an organization committed to the destruction of israel and the saudis continue to oppose the peace efforts undertaken as a result of the camp david accords if we are even considering the sale of these powerful weapons to this country then a definitive change in policy seems to be the minimum that we should expect the saudis refusal to make these concessions means that we are selling offensive weapons to a country which is not our friend and is threatening the survival of our ally israel an additional consideration is what this sale means for the economy of israel the administration has also announced that we will sell israel 600 million of additidnal weaponry this to me is a clear acknowledgment of the additional demands the saudi sale will place on israels defense system it is important to note that 40 percent of israels budget is already spent on defense and further escalation of these demands will only further strain israels economy to risk this without clear and significant concessions on the part of the saudis cannot be tolerated one month ago i expressed my grave concerns over the proposal on the sale of f15s in a letter to secretary haig at that time i expressed the hope that on his trip to the middle east now underway the secretary would receive some assurance from the saudis of a change in policy toward the camp david peace process the text of the

i am pleased to join the gentleman from vermont in offering these amendments and would like to thank the gentleman for his patience and hard work in helping to create the job training partnership act as has already been said our amendment does not add to the cost of the bill or reduce the administrative flexibility it provides however it does make clear that states and prime sponsors that want to target conservation and renewable energy for employment training under the legislation will have the support of the congress this clarification will serve a useful purpose most members are familiar with the department of energys lowincome weatherization program which provides grants that are used to insulate the homes of the elderly the handicapped and households with limited income the program is funded through federal grants but administered and operated entirely at the local level which is perhaps one reason it has proved so popular and so successful in fact it is a prime example of how federalism should work in practice unfortunately despite the programs proven track record and repeated support by the congress through the appropriations process bureaucrats at the department of energy appeared ready to let the weatherization grants die last winter the refusal by doe to clarify its intent with regard to releasing funds for weatherization grants threw state energy offices into a turmoil and disrupted the planning process necessary to the smooth functioning of any program only a lastminute intervention by a number of members of congress kept the program alive our amendments will pre vent federal bureaucrats with an ideological bias against conservation and renewable energy from inflicting their prejudices on states who wish to use tne funding provided by this legislation for energy employment training a recent study commissioned by the national council of senior citizens suggests that there are good reasons why a state might want to invest in training workers in weatherization and other employement in conservation the report based on a survey of energy costs for 24 000 households makes clear that for our nations elderly the energy crisis is as real as ever despite assurances to the contrary a few dramatic statistics from the report illustrate the dimensions of the problem first one out of every four elderly lowincome households spends more than 40 percent of its income on energy in the winter second during the winter months more than half of the lowincome households in new england heating with fuel oil spend more than 60 percent of their income to meet energy costs and third in my own state of rhode island energy costs in the coldest month of the winter average 300which is 20 more than the social security monthly payment for a single elderly person living alone with rising natural gas prices the problem is going to get worse before it gets better the lowincome weatherization program has provided a costeffective reponse to the problem as new england statistics demonstrate since the programs beginning 63 100 homes in new england have been weatherized for an annual savings to these households of 14 7 million per year that compares very favorably to the 11 7 million budgeted for the new england weatherization program this year however like many federal programs the weatherization grants have fallen on hard times funding for does program has been cut by about 40 percent since 1981 and the ceta program which used to supplement does efforts by paying for weatherization crews has been abolished de spite the sharp cutbacks states have struggled to keep the weatherization program alive because they appreciate its value my own state of rhode island has recruited weatherization crews from our adult correctional institute in cranston thanks to the efforts of the gentleman from vermont and other members of the committee who have worked so hard on this legislation the job training partnership act will eliminate many of the abuses associated with the old ceta program our amendments will allow states to train weatherization crews by working on weatherstripping and insulating lowincome housing however unlike the ceta program the job partnership training act has been carefully designed to insure those same workers will eventually be moved into employment in the private sector where the market for residential conservation services will continue to grow it seems entirely consistent with the purposes of h r 5320 to make clear that states that want to train their work force for conservation or renewable

court is going to throw us out i say that because the lawyer who assisted us in drafting this resolution failed to include one of the most fundamental and indispensible words that any citation of contempt must have to go anywhere in a court proceeding and that word is willful it is a jurisdictional fact we have not said that ms gorsuch willfully failed to do anything we have just said she failed to do something and you cannot hold anybody in contempt unless you charge them with willful disobedience of an act within the jurisdiction of the person asserting the authority second let me tell the members how a judge or a justice of an appellate court is going to look at this record when we correct this resolution after we fail the first time the court will say counsel do you mean to tell me that the congress refused to look at 786 977 documents the citee produced and yet is attempting to hold the citee in contempt for falling to produce 23 more get out of here commonsense dictates that congress must first examine what is produced then assert that such documents have been examined and the unproduced are needed to complete its investigative function i am in opposition to this resolution which would cite the epa administrator as being in contempt of congress while recognizing that this institution has an important constitutional role in overseeing the implementation of the laws it has passed a delineation has to be made between constructive oversight over as opposed to counterproductive meddling in the implementation of such laws as a member of the energy and commerce committee i have some familiarity with this issue in that our committees oversight and investigations subcommittee has also requested documents pertaining to superfundalbeit a more reasonable numberand has been similarly denied what is important to remember is that this dential of documents is not so much an exercise of executive privilege as it is a claim of separation of powers neither the administrator nor the administration is claiming that certain documents should never be turned over instead what they are claiming and what should be of concern to every member of this houseis that should not be required to prejudice enforcement efforts while they are still in progress the argument may be made that you can not have effective oversight unless congress can see what kinds of enforcement activities are going on but the other side of that coin is if we can look into all that is on while it is going on we become a participant in the process and that is not what the founding fathers had in mind it was their intention that the executive branch enforce the law not the legislative branch as legislators our duty is to decide what the law should be and then if it does not produce the intended results to change it accordingly but in this case we do not know if the law has produced the desired results indeed it has only been in effect for a year and a half and it still has 3 years to run also it should be remembered that epa is willing to turn over a vast ma jority of the documents requestedall but 300 to 400 pages out of an astounding total of 787 000 the pages being withheld go beyond the realm of summarizing actions taken or not taken rather they involve legal analysis and possible legal strategies that might be pursued in the prosecution of the case as a lawyer i can share with my colleagues the thought that premature disclosure of such analyses and potential strategies would be most helpful to those suspected of noncompliancethe very people that i suspect the authors of this resolution would not want to see helped now i realize that none of my colleagues would ever think of leaking such information if it became known to them but then again capitol hill leaks are not unheard of so i do not think that it is any more unreasonable for the executive branch to try and protect itself against the premature disclosure of prejudicial information than it is for the legislative branch to try and obtain information essential to the fulfillment of its constitutional responsibilities that being the case i think this body should be seeking an accommodation that would balance the respective interests of the legislative and executive branches of government rather than promote a confrontation between them one of the reasons i suggest this is that epa has gone a long way toward providing the requested material another is that epa was not given very much time to do it indeed it is my understanding that the epa only had 8 days to comply with this subpena not a very long period considering how long it has taken this congress to pass appropriations bills considering how difficult it has been for this congress to meet budget deadlines and considering how many other environmental matters have been shuffled under the rug by this congress just looking at the record and comparing it with what is being requested here and one could conceivably wonder if this is not a way to distract public attention away from what this congress has not been doing of course i realize that no member of this august body would stoop so low as to put politics above principle in such a fashionor in any fashion for that matterbut surely there are other matters just as much in need of attention or more in need of attention than this right now clean air legislation has been stalled for almost 2 years now to cite one example and i am reminded that clean water legislation which was submitted to the public works and transportation committee early last summer has yet to be reported in any form what an irony for the public to behold a 22page clean water proposal cannot be marked up in 6 months but 787 000 pages of documents covering 160 hazardous waste sites should be produced in toto without regard to the sensitive nature of the contents within 8 days if this is not a case of the pot calling the kettle black i am not sure what is the real question isdo we have the courage to admit as much to ourselves and the nation if not is it any wonder congress continues to rate so low in the public opinion polls one additional point needs to be made just because congress has been lax in cutting spending and getting the nations fiscal house in order it does not follow that that the executive branch should be held any less accountable two wrongs do not make a right hopefully the next congress will begin to get its act together just as the epa administrator in recent testimony before the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee has indicated that improvements should and have been made in epas internal operation however it is difficult for either congress or epa to make those improvements if a tremendous amount of time and resources are being expended in a questionable legal scrap which reminds me quite a fuss has been raised by environmentalists over cutbacks in epas budget the last year or two and yet here we have some"]]}
