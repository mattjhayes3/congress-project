necessary support during our many conversations with cms on the crisis and its impact on new mexicans it has been clear there is a lack of meaningful data that is needed to hold policymakers accountable it is unacceptable that after months and months of requesting stateprovided data on the behavioral health system in new mexico cms would simply determine this data to have significant limitations a report from new mexicos legislative finance committee identified similar concerns the report stated that the amount and quality of utilization data collected by the state of new mexico had deteriorated leaving the question of whether enrollees are receiving more or less care without access to meaningful data we cannot determine how best to invest to strengthen our behavioral health

which reauthorizes federalaid highway and transit programs for two weeks through december 4 2015 instead of this 14day temporary extension i would have strongly preferred that we were debating a final conference report on h r 22 the surface transportation reauthorization and reform act of 2015 which provides for what used to be the customary sixyear reauthorization of surface transportation programs to provide certainty and stability to the needed effort to repair rebuild and revitalize the nations crumbling infrastructure the senate amendment to the conference report on h r 22 the surface transportation reauthorization and reform act of 2015 passed by a vote of 6534 nearly a twothirds majority while the version of the bill passed by the house version of the bill which included two jackson lee amendments passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 36364 i reluctantly support this emergency but temporary measure because as the department of transportation has reported if we do not act now highway trust fund balances will reach dangerously low levels by november 20 and result in a reduction of payments to states by an average of 28 percent many states have already canceled or delayed planned construction projects threatening 700 000 thousands of jobs including 106 100 jobs in my home state of texas the highway trust fund was created in 1956 during the eisenhower administration to help finance construction of the interstate highway system which modernized the nations transportation infrastructure and was instrumental in making the united states the worlds dominant economic power for two generations our national leaders then understood that investing in our roads and bridges strengthened our economy created millions of goodpaying jobs and improved the quality of life for all americans it is currently composed of two accounts that fund federalaid highway and transit projects built by states federal funding from the trust fund accounts for a major portion of state transportation spending the highway trust fund is financed by gasoline and diesel taxes which until the last decade produced a steady increase in revenues sufficient to accommodate increased levels of spending on highway and transit projects however those tax rates18 4 cents gallon federal tax on gasoline and a 24 4 cents gallon tax on diesel fuelhave remained unchanged since 1993 and were not indexed to inflation so the value of those revenues has eroded over the years and combined with the fact that vehicles have been getting increasingly better mileage the revenues deposited into the highway trust fund beginning last decade have not kept pace with highway and transit spending from the trust fund consequently since 2008 congress has periodically had to transfer at the 11th hour general treasury revenues into the trust fund to pay for authorized highway and transit spending levels and avoid a funding shortfall the total amount to date is more than 74 billion obviously this practice is economically inefficient and injects uncertainty in the highway construction plans projects and schedules of state and local transportation agencies not to mention the anxiety it causes to workers and businesses who economic livelihood is dependent on those projects the last transportation authorized by congress for 4 years or more safetealu expired on september 30 2009 at the end of fy 2009 because congress and the administration could not agree to a new reauthorization it was necessary to resort to stopgap temporary extensions on no less than eight occasions spanning a period of 910 days before congress finally enacted the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 act on july 6 2012 which reauthorized highway and transportation programs through fiscal year 2014 a little more than two years or until september 30 2014 map21 was intended as a shortterm measure to give congress and the administration breathing room to reach agreement on a longterm reauthorization bill yet as mr levin the ranking member of the ways and means committee has often pointed out since gaining the majority in 2010 our republican colleagues have failed to take any action to sustain the highway trust fund over the longterm and shore up vital infrastructure projects and has not held even a single hearing on financing options for the highway trust fund it is long past time for this congress and especially the house majority to focus on the real problems and challenges facing the american people and one of the biggest of those challenges is ensuring that america has a transportation policy and the infrastructure needed to compete and win in the global economy of the 21 st century to do that we have to extend the reauthorization of current transportation programs and to authorize the transfer of the funds to the highway trust fund needed to fund authorized construction projects and keep 700 000 workers including 106 100 in texas on the job but that is only a start and just a part of our job the real work that needs to be done in the remaining days of this congress is to reach an agreement on h r 22

to respond to their concerns i want to thank the president secretary kerry secretary moniz secretary lew and so many others for their leadership and availability to us in a bipartisan way in our democratic caucus for years irans rapidly accelerating enrichment capability and burgeoning nuclear stockpile has represented one of the greatest threats to peace and security anywhere in the world we all stipulate to that that is why we need an agreement that is why i am so pleased that we have so many statements of validation from people the experts say this agreement is one of the greatest diplomatic achievements of the 21st century it is no wonder that such a diverse and extraordinary constellation of experts have made their voices heard in support of thisagain i use the word extraordinary accord on the steps of the capitol the other day with our veterans and with our gold star moms who have lost their sons we heard the words of diplomats and soldiers generals and admirals and diplomats by the scoredemocrats republicans and nonpartisan we heard from our most distinguished nuclear physicists we heard from those scientists and we heard from people of faith i would like to quote some of them more than 100 democratic and republican former diplomats and ambassadors wrote in our judgment the jcpoa deserves congressional support and the opportunity to show that it can work we firmly believe that the most effective way to protect unitedstates national security and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that toughminded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before considering other more risky alternatives that is the diplomats the generals and admirals wrote there is no better option to prevent an iranian nuclear weapon if the iranians cheat our advanced technology intelligence and the inspections will reveal it and unitedstates military options remain on the table and if the deal is rejected by america the iranians could have a nuclear weapon within a year the choice is that stark twentynine of our nations most prominent nuclear scientists and engineers wrote we consider that the joint comprehensive plan of action the united states and its partners negotiated with iran will advance the cause of peace and security in the middle east and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements i quote and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements this is an innovative agreement with much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework they went on to say more 440 rabbis urged congress to endorse the statement writing the obama administration has successfully brought together the major international powers to confront iran over its nuclear ambitions the broad international sanctions move iran to enter this historic agreement they urge support 4 100 catholic nuns wrote to congress stating as women of faith followers of the one who said blessed are the peacemakers we urge that you risk on the side of peace and vote to approve the iran nuclear deal treasury secretary jack lew warned of the hazards of rejecting the agreement reminding us that foreign governments will not continue to make costly sacrifices at our demand i say this in response to something that my distinguished colleague from california said indeed they would be more likely to blame us for walking away from a credible solution to one of the worlds greatest security threats and would continue to reengage with iran he went on to say instead of toughening the sanctions the decision by congress to unilaterally reject the deal will end a decade of isolation of iran and put the united states at odds with the rest of the world we certainly dont want to do that today something very interesting happened it was a statement put forth by u k prime minister david cameron french president francois hollande and german chancellor angela merkel they wrote an oped for the washington post and said this is an important moment it is a crucial opportunity at a time of heightened global uncertainty to show what diplomacy can achieve this is not an agreement based on trust or any assumption about how iran may look in 10 or 15 years it is based on detailed tightly written controls that are verifiable and longlasting they went on to say we condemn in no uncertain terms that iran does not recognize the existence of the state of israel and the unacceptable language that irans leaders use about israel israels security matters are and will remain our key interests too we would not have reached the nuclear deal with iran if we did not think that it removed a threat to the region and the nonproliferation regime as a whole we are confident that the agreement provides the foundation for resolving a conflict on irans nuclear program permanently this is why we now want to embark on the full implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action once all national procedures are complete our own president wrote to congressman jerry nadler i believe that jcpoa which cuts off every pathway iran could have to a nuclear weapon and creates the must robust verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program is a very good deal for the united states for the state of israel and for the region as a whole many of us share the views that had been expressed by those in a position to make a difference on this agreement tuesday night again after the votes here in this house dozens of members supporting the nuclear agreement stood on the steps of the capitol we were

it is because the rules committee took place only days after orlando and even republicans didnt have the nerve to authorize gun legislation so close to the orlando gun massacre is that what it is

month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget

435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by

old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers

when we are talking about foreign affairs that is why i love the foreign affairs committee our nations security and our interests abroad are too important to let partisan politics get in the way ninetynine times out of 100 the foreign affairs committee operates in that spirit and this bill is an exception to that i think the lack of input from both sides of the aisle the lack of time the foreign affairs committee didnt spend working on it is reflected in the final product i am not pointing a finger at anybody again i think mr russell is sincere about this i think we want the same thing this bill is deeply flawed it would force the president to meet an impossible standard on an issue where congress had already spoken that is no way to advance our interests abroad that is no way to hold iran accountable so lets vote down this bill go back to the drawing board and come back with bipartisan legislation that would actually help us achieve our aims i urge a no vote again the question here is not whether iran can be trusted they cannot iran is a bad player three people on this side of the aisle who spoke against this bill voted against the jcpoa so it is not a matter of just trying to rubberstamp what the administration wants or anything like that no we dont think that this bill goes in the right direction we dont want to embarrass the president we want to work with the president to make sure that irans feet are held to the fire again we had the vote on the iran deal i voted no my friends on that side of the aisle voted no but we lost so lets not repeat what we have done with the affordable care act 62 times again and again and again playing gotcha with the president lets do something that really works lets put our heads together to make it work we can take parts of this bill and put it together into a bipartisan bill i am not opposed to that but we have got to do it together politics need to stop at the waters edge so lets now work together to ensure that iran is complying with the jcpoa that would be a positive step forward lets hold their feet to the fire lets make sure they do what they are supposed to do because i dont trust them anymore than anybody on that side of the aisle so i urge a no vote lets go back to the drawing board lets do what the foreign affairs committee is known for doing for the past 3 years under the leadership of chairman royce and myself we believe that we are the most bipartisan committee in the congress we believe that is the way foreign policy should be created and i know we can do better again i dont impugn anyones motives lets all put our heads together and lets come up with a bill that we can pass and be proud of i urge a no vote i yield back the balance of my time"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "the

the house considered h r 1599 the safe and accurate food labeling act it is my intention to vote against this legislation for the past four decades i have fought tirelessly for one of the finest products in the world wild alaskan salmon the multibillion dollar seafood industry in alaska is the largest private sector employer in my state yet the approval of a genetically engineered ge salmon or frankenfish as i call it could put our thriving and iconic fishing sector in jeopardy frankenfish could pose a grave threat to our wild salmon stocks in alaska and the food and drug administrations fda support for approving ge salmon is disturbing equally disturbing is the fact that if approved the fda has said that it would not require ge salmon to be labeled in todays global marketplace a consumers access to accurate ingredient information is paramount clear and accurate ge labeling requirements attempt to mitigate the risk of market confusion or rejection by countries that have no interest in purchasing the hybrid organism consumer confusion about what types of salmon or seafood are genetically engineered may deter shoppers from purchasing these products altogether if ge salmon is approved despite opposition from congress and nearly two million people who wrote in to the fda it should be clearly labeled to avoid the potential market rejection of all salmon in an effort to ensure that alaskan consumers have this essential information alaska enacted legislation in 2005 that requires the labeling of all products containing ge fish and shellfish however the socalled safe and accurate food labeling act recently referred out of the house agriculture committee would block states like alaska from requiring mandatory labeling of ge fish while also curtailing fdas ability to craft a true national ge labeling system rather its proponents would suggest that alaskan fishermen should go through a costly nongmo certification if they want consumers to know that their salmon is not genetically engineered why should all unitedstates salmon fishermen have to prove their salmon are nongmo when farmed ge salmon coming into the unitedstates from other countries would not it is

to oppose it i appreciate that mr takano does believe that we need to provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so

visitor safety and eliminates the healthiest choice for bottled drinks leaving sugary drinks as a primary alternative the policy runs counter to the park services own healthy parks healthy people

reduce waste but the national park service has confirmed that participating parks havent been able to determine if the policy works to start we know parks dont separately analyze recycled waste visitors leave behind parks simply cant say whether the ban has worked it is also worth noting that studies conducted on similar water bans show that they arent effective in reducing waste a study in the american journal of public health found the bottled water bans on college campuses had unintended consequences eliminating bottled water did not in fact reduce waste but actually led to a spike in

individuals aged 21 to 64 who are patients in imds imds are inpatient facilities with more than 16 beds that primarily treat people with mental health and substance abuse disorders the original imd exclusion is consistent with the goal of treating severe mental illness in the least restrictive setting feasible the imd exclusion provided an incentive to shift the cost of care for mental illness to other care modalities and facilities where medicaid matching funds were available however since the imd exclusion was included with the creation of the medicaid program in 1965 our mental healthcare system and overall healthcare system have evolved notably in recent years we have seen a significant decrease in the number of publicly funded inpatient psychiatric beds available for emergency services this has contributed to patients in need of critical mental health services facing psychiatric boarding in general hospital emergency departments psychiatric boarding occurs when an individual with a mental health condition is kept in a hospital emergency department for several hours or admitted to medical wards or skilled nursing facilities without psychiatric expertise because appropriate mental health services were unavailable this leads to potential serious consequences for psychiatric patients and unnecessary hospital costs the patient protection and affordable care act authorized a 3year demonstration program to study the effects of allowing federal medicaid matching funds to pay for emergency psychiatric treatment for adults that is otherwise prohibited by the medicaid imd exclusion the demonstration was funded with 75 million in fy 2011 and these funds were available for obligation through december 31 2015 the hhs secretary selected 11 states and the

language in this bill is dedicated to preventing and investigating evasion within that unit there will be a point of contact for private sector evasion allegations who will have the authority to direct these evasion investigations and the duty to inform interested parties they have to inform the interested parties about the status of the investigations we have also increased the types of data
