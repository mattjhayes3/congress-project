lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on

request for an increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we are debating foday is itself another mystery the clintons have repeatedly denied requests from congress for a list of white

democrat leadership by some surprise in a house they have controlled with an iron hand for four decades the democrats do not have much experience with losing votes so last weeks 216to205 vote caused quite a stira stir many of us hoped would lead immediately to a better rule unfortunately but not surprisingly those hopes have not materialized instead of changing the rule the democrat leadership is changing the vote instead of prompt relief for the victims they get smoke and mirrors instead of receiving the message from the membership that it is a bad rule the democrat leadership apparently resorted to strongarming members and letting pressure build over the weekend to change enough votes to get their their way and their bad rule as a result today we havd essentially the same rule we defeated last week minus any fical responsibility and still inexplicably wedded to a totally unrelated provision to pay 100 stipends for 30yearold teenagers in los angeles no brave new change here same old business as usual the democrat leadership has held on like a dog with a bone to this extraneous provisioneven at the risk of delaying relief to the flood victims in the midwest it is no wonder some members and the media are openly specutating about what dealmaking is going on behind the scenes of the democrat leadership a bipartisan trio representing flood victims nonetheless recognized that our government is deeply in debt and that we have got to face the costs of flood relief in the context of our already debilitating national debt payments these members asked and answered the question of how to pay for this flood relief bileither from this years budget or nextlo avoid heaping additional debt onto our childmn and grandchildren twice they pleaded with the democrat majority on the rules committse to allow the full house to debate their ideas and twice they were turned down i think it is fair to graphically compare the 1993 flood in the mississippi river valley to the federal debt both are swallowing up our livelihood the vote on this rule cannot stop the flood but it can reduce the national debt yet one of my colleagues on the rules committee went so far in avoiding specifics of how to pay for this 3 billion bill that he told messrs penny slatrery and nussle to just go away and let us help you it is a quote almost as memorable as hello rm from the government and im here to help you we all have compassion for the flood victimsand we will help them helping people who have been hit by a natural disaster is one of our govemments greatest obligatdons but years of ignoring the costs of our actions emergency and pseudoemergency have sapped our resources administratlon spokesman leon panetta has stated that we cannot really afford to fully help these flood victims and that probably applies to other victims of other natural disasters yet to comeunless we change our patterns of spending more money than we have i am willing to cut spending in other governmont accounts to ensure that we can help the flood victims i know many of my colleagues feel the same wayand we should at least be allowed to have that debate on the house

they are young middle class families middle class federal employees or middle class eldery the middle class will be hit by the btu tax which will cost the average family approximately 500 in additional taxes they will be hit with fewer jobs an estimated 400 000 to 600 000 fewer jobs throughout the country including approximately 1 600 jobs lost in my district along according to the national taxpayers union every worker and every business throughout my state and throughout this country will be hit with this new tax big this will in turn hurt our competitiveness abroad as we raise the price of doing business for every employer and producer in the united states this btu tax penalizes lower and middleincome families hurt schools and hospitals and increases our dependence on foreign oil under this tax hospitals will have to spend more or energy and less on healing schools will have to spend more money on transporting kids to school and less on educating them parents will have to spend more money getting back and forth to work less on supporting their families adding tens of thousands of dollars to school and hospital budgets will have a devastating impact on local economies and dramatically harm the physical and educational welfare of millions of individuals the affordable energy alliance estimates that had this proposed btu tax been fully implemented in 1990 virginia residents and businesses would have paid 701 4 million in additional energy taxes a tax burden this large would hit virginias economy particularly hard at a time when we have defense cutbacks hitting our area disproportionately along with millions of federal employees who will be subject to a wage freeze the national association of counties has noted that these increased federal taxes will reduce local revenues and result in the need for local governments to increase property taxes sales taxes and service fees at a time when local governments are still experiencing the adverse effects of the recession again the middle class will be hit the hardest the elderly on fixed incomes are also hit hard under this clinton plan the democrat plan promises to raise taxes on seniors making as late as 25 000 and while the energy tax is indexed the income level at which social security benefits will be taxed at a higher level is not indexed so millions of seniors will graduate into this new tax bracket each year and this increased tax in a breach of trust with the american people will not be returned to the social security trust fund but will instead be diverted into the general revenue fund for increased government spending no country in the world has this kind of tax this tax will be very difficult to administer and will require all kinds of new regulations and regulators to enforce it this bill reserves for the treasury department the power to unilaterally change new energy tax rates expand or contract the products subject to the tax and the power to exempt certain taxpayers this means the rules on this tax can continue to be changed and businesses will be subject to ever changing rules again this will hurt competitiveness and is not fair the republican alternative to the democratic tax plan is superior in many respects and i will support it because it achieves considerable deficit reduction without the burdensome taxes which i have just described my republican colleagues who helped fashion this plan did so under considerable time restrictions and have made many tough decisions in crafting this plan the kasich plan will reduce the budget deficit by 352 billion yet does not increase taxes or touch social security benefits while the clinton plan places a disproportionate burden on federal and military employees and retirees the republican plan eases this heavy burden i believe the men and women who serve in the civil service and milltary should be treated fairly it is important to consider the longterm benefits of having a qualified and effective federal and military workforce and be cautious in producing shortterm savings at their expense unlike the clinton plan the republican substitute wont delay federal retirees cost of living adjustments and it wont put limits on federal employees colas or locality pay also it does not delay military retirees colas and it does not freeze military pay the way the democrat plan would do coupled with the tax increases federal and military employees and retirees would suffer more than any other segment of the population under the clinton plan the republican plan is a dramatic improvement over the tax and spend democrat budget however the republican plan has some aspects i am concerned about under the republican substitute federal employees retirement age would be increased from age 55 to 62 and nondisabled military retirees would have their colas delayed until they reach age 62 federal employees have relied to their detriment on certain promises made by their employer the federal government and these promises should be respecied no other nongovernmental entity can unilaterally alter the terms of an employment contract its illegal and wrong while the congress can change the terms of an employees employment or retirement legally it is still unfair i reiterate that the republican substitute is substantially more equitable to federal and military employees and retirees than the democrat version however if i had the opportunity to amend either version which i dont because the rules committee gagged every member of this body by only allowing one amendment on the floor today i would offer additional spending cuts to make up the difference in maintaining the federal and military employee and retirees benefits what could we possibly cut to make up the difference i suggest and many would agree that we cut funding for the superconducting super collider others concerned could find other cuts if given the opportunity under the rules plagued with dramatic cost overruns management problems and no foreign contnbutions to the projects as was promised i believe this is a project that we cant currently afford given our budget defict yesterday mr victor s rezendes director of energy and science issues resources community and economic development dmsion of the unitedstates general accounting office testified that the total estimated cost of the scc is not yet known but the projects total cost will exceed 11 billion this 11 billion is more than enough to keep our commitment to federal and military employees and retirees if this plan passes the house i would work to restore these benefits by cutting the scc all americans have a deep concern about the deficit which i share and want us to cut the deficit so our children and grandchildren dont bear the burden of our ex cess the clinton plan increases taxes increases spending and as a result the deficit will not be reduced in order to cut the deficit americans want us to cut spending

for their constituents votes after raising their taxes by 402 billion 402 billion = billion in new taxes and 74 billion in hidden taxes that they are not owning up to 402 billion their net spending cuts over 5 years are 3 billion and that includes 112 billion in defense cuts so if you take the defense cuts out that were going to take place anyhow you are actually increasing domestic spending by 109 billion you tell the american people you are going to get control of spending you are going to cut this deficit and you are increasing domestic spending 109 billion and increasing their tax 402 billion more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and if that aint recessionary folks i do not know what is let me just give some information here that my democrat colleagues may not be aware of the nashville center for policy analysis says that this plan will lower capital formation in the united states by 1 8 trillion that is money that we need to have invested for plant and industry expansion that will create more jobs but no and because of this slower growth that you are going to create they estimate 1 4 million fewer jobs over the next 5 years but that is not all this economic loss is equal to more than 1 000 for every man woman and child in the country or more than 2 600 for the average household by 1998 the clinton plan will cause wage income in the united states to be 160 billion lower than it would have been that means that about every fulltime employee is going to take a 1 600 pay cut and on average workers will lose 8 in aftertax income for every dollar lost by investors this is the program you are going to present to the american people i cannot imagine that we created 21 million new jobs in the 1980s we had economic growth and here you are you are going to put 1 4 million people out of work with these huge tax increases not to mention the companies you are going to drive overseas with the btu tax increase truckers the airline industry farmers foundries every industry is going to be adversely impacted by the 15centagallon gasoline tax and fuel tax that is going to be loaded on the back of arilines yet you are going to go right ahead with it i hope you know what you are doing it certainly does not appear as though you do right now let me just give a constructive alternative that we have proposed and i hope the committee on rules will allow us to bring to the floor tomorrow and that is a freeze plus 2 percent i wish my good friend the gentleman from minnesota would listen to this part of my talk a freeze plus 2 percent if we froze at last years spending levels plus a 2percent growth over the next 5 years we could reach a balanced budget by 1998 using cbos figures as far as income is concerned if we go back to a 3percent growth in tax revenues as we have had traditionally we would actually have a surplus by the year 1998 without a tax increase i hope all my friends across this country that may be paying attention to this debate will listen the republicans have the kasich plan which is far superior to the democrat plan in that it does not increase taxes and it gets to a lower deficit figure in 5 years second we have a plan that is a 2percent above freeze that gets us to a balanced budget without a tax increase so if you do not want your taxes raised america if you want to cut the fat and waste out of government spending if you want to take a meat cleaver to government then vote for the republicans because they are the ones that are trying to do something about it they will tell you we do not have a plan we have two plans the kasich plan and the 2percent plus freeze and both of them do it without massive tax increases they tell you we need more money they tell you we need 400 billion more in taxes ten years ago we were bringing in 500 billion in tax revenue and today we are bringing in 1 2 trillion we have almost tripled the amount of taxes coming into this country in 10 years and yet they want 400 billion more is that not amazing we have almost tripled the tax revenues coming in in 10 years and they still want 400 billion more and they are still not going to reach a balanced

30year period violent crime has gone up 560 percent the fbi tells us and i find this unbelievable but i do believe it because it is their figures and they are based on their analysis that during the life of an individual 8 out of 10 americans will be the victim of a violent crime that is truly shocking but we all know it do we not look at what is happening in our communities this next oneis fascinating we just heard how during the 0year period that spending at al levels of government has gone up fivefold and welfare spendinghas 630 percent this next chart tells us about the miserable failure of liberalism in this country this chart shows starting hack here you can see in the 50s here is the poverty rate the poverty rate if falling falling falling falling and falling look when it levels offand goes back up this happens when lbj comes into power and launches the war on poverty look at the dramatic increases in spending the more spending goes up look what is happening to this line the line is level it goes down it goes up a little bit then herwe axre in 1990 whereit starts heading up of course these are the last years we have figures for so i cannot tell you more recently but the factof the matter is we have spent in this 30year period i believe 3 5 trillion that put us deeply in debt to alleviate poverty we have created a dependent culture that just saps up more and more of out taxpayer dollars this is resulting in broken homes and more violent crime of enormous proportions this is why we have got to have further time to really talk about this on another occasion next is births to unmarried women look at this line right here in 1960 it was about 5 percent of unmarried women who gave birth look over here in 1990 we are almost at 28 percent a fivefold increase what is happening to these children these children are emotionally deprived for the most part you saw that statistic on the 560percent increase in violent crime the fastest growing component of those violent crimes is juvenile crimes that is what we are creating by the social policies that are entirely misplaced here is the chart that illustrates the increase in welfare spending it is never enough all these trillions of dollars and we still havepeople in power in the federal government from the president on down who tell us oh we have got to spend more that is what president clinton was quoted as saying on the front page of the washington post last friday we have got to raise some more revenues and get this economy going which is totally inconsistent why so that we can spend more this is completely unbelievable then he has given us a plan and let us go back to this chart for a minute a plan which is going to add 1 trillion to the national debt cumulatively and which is going to end us up after the largest tax increase in history at the end of the clinton 5year plan with an annual budget deficit of s228 5 billion some plan the famlily we see federal taxes look at this increase in the average family with median income a family of four in 1948 paid about 2 percent of its total income to the unitedstates government in taxes the same family in 1986 paid 24 percent of its income to the unitedstates government in taxes and that figure went up where by 1990 it looks like over 25 percent now from 2 to 25 percent is a twelvefold increase a 1 200percent increase in taxes to the federal government that is truly dramatic this last chart which i think is very illustrative and maybe we can end on this note represents the federal budget deficit the annual deficit going clear back to the 1940s these are inflation adjusted now of course look at what we have during the world war ii years we have annual budget deficits one of them here looks like about 1943 we have an annual budget deficit inflation adjusted of about 680 billion this is truly staggering but look at what happens here of course during the war years this goes on then we get right to here which appears to be about 1947 you can see what it is it is about 180 billion a dramatic reduction just by way of comparison our budget deficit this year is 320 billion for the fiscal year ending september 30 we are not in world war ii under the clinton plan in 5 years we are going to go from 320 to 228 5 billion look at what happened here you go in 5 years from an enormous budget deficit here at over 500 billion and my word you are up to here where you have nearly 100 billion in surplus now can you see the chauge there it is a 600 billion change we went from deep deficit to surplus we are not in world war ii right now why can we not act more quickly why can we not eliminate these tax increases out the spending bring the economy back up by reducing the deficit reducing the regulation reducing the burdens on the family strengthening our families provide incentives for people to help themselves in the inner cities and in the suburbs and pull these families back together transmit family values make us

that not only determines the course of our future but whether we will indeed have a future im happy to say that several members of this body have joined me in this call of support for our children the families and children of america are suffering and we cannot rescue one without saving the other as a noted child advocate has said and i quote it a community values its children it must cherish their parents my colleagues the care and nurturing of our families and children must become a national priority it is no longer acceptable to pay lip service to this issue not when 22 percent of all childrenmore than 1 out of 5live in poverty as a woman of color i cannot in good conscience keep silent when i know that more than half of those children 55 percent to be exactare africanamerican or hispanic in this land where the american dream still looms large as the one thing for which we should all strive there are people who toll at hardlabor every day of the week and only to find themselves still below the poverty level almost 12 percent of the families in this rich nation of ours make up the working poor and again for families of color the figure doubles to over 25 percent members of the house it is meanspirited and disgraceful that we continue to allow these conditions to exist there are those members in this body who would vote against any initiatives to help families and children while at the same time professing a deep love and devotion to our nation and this democracy to those members i say this is a shortsighted and hypocritical way to do business if you want to prove your allegiance to america then do it by standing up for those who will lead her into the 21 century members of the conference committee will have the opportunity to do that over the next few days as the budget reconciliation bill takes shape the measure that was approved by the house held four provisions that would put both our children and our families first those programs are childhood immunization earned income tax credit the mickey leland hunger program and the family preservation and support program i ask the members of the house for their continued support for these programs lets start with the immunization program dont let anybody tell you that parents can get their children immunized if they simply would make the effort to do it the numbers dont support that myth right now the rate of immunization against deadly childhood diseases in this country is a measly 55 percent how can we look ourselves in the mirror and say its ok for 55 000 children to be crippled or killed by a preventable disease like measles it happened in 1991 and will most certainly happen again how can we simply stand by and allow polio mumps rubella and meningitis to take this terrible toll on our children i submit to you that we cannot and before you tell yourself that the vaccines are available to everyone so we really dont need to do anything about this problem let me quickly tell you that the cost of immunizing a child jumped from 11 in 1977 to 133 in 1992 its called an economic deterrent many low and middleincome families who lack health insurance simply cant afford the service included in the house reconciliation legislation is a universal vaccine assurance system which would serve 11 1 million children who are now currently uninsured or underinsured medicaideligible or native american in north carolina 290 000 children would receive vaccinations 116 000 more than are currently eligible under medicaid i argue that providing vaccines for children is not only the morally right thing to do it is also fiscally sound let me remind my colleagues that 1 spent on immunizations now saves at least 10 in treatment down the road to sum it up briefly we can pay the bill now or pay it later the choice is ours with the issue of hunger i make the same plea we can provide children with the proper nutrition to grow strong bodies and healthy minds now or pay the consequences later the mickey leland food stamp provisions are critical to addressing the grievous problem of hunger the nationwide community childhood hunger identification project released in 1991 reported that 5 5 million american children under age 12 are hungry this means 1 out of every 12 furthermore an additional 6 million children find themselves in families that are at risk of hunger because sometimes these families in order to pay their utility bills in the winter can not afford to buy food these figures are astonishing in light of the abundance that we find in american agriculture onehalf of the recipients of food stamp benefits are children while 80 percent of the benefits in the program go to families with children put simply the food stamp program is the frontline of defense for preventing hunger in america over 96 percent of the benefits go to people at or below the poverty line most58 percentgo to households that are so poor that their income does not exceed half of the poverty line we must not accept hunger as a standard in this country the mickey leland provisions of the reconciliation bill speak to the problem of hunger by providing basic subsistence to those who are in desperate need i deeply urge my colleagues to support the efforts of individuals like the late mickey leland who died while attempting to address the deplorable conditions faced by the hungry on the african continent after we have fed our children and provided for their health we must help empower their working parents to lift themselves out of poverty that is the goal of the earned income tax credit program currently about 5 million americans work 40hour weeks and still remain below the poverty line it is a disgrace that individuals in america can work full time and never rise out of poverty in the house reconciliation bill families with two or more children that earn up to 8 500 a yearwhat fulltime minimum wage work now pays would receive a wage supplement to bring them to the poverty line i believe that an expanded eitc is essential to reward work and pave the way for welfare reform further the eitc would be of great benefit to low and moderate income working families in north carolina some 485 000 working families with children in north carolina received the fjtc in 1992 the expanded eitc program in the house passed reconciliation bill would have ensured that those workers with families and childless workers were brought up to the poverty line this is especially important in light of the increasing tax burden on the poor without an expanded eitc program which includes childless workers we will be taxing those poorest among us deeper into poverty i urge all members to show their support for this program especially to the finance committee of the senate and the ways and means committee of the house to work for its inclusion in the conference report finally i ask that my colleagues on the conference committee pay special attention to the family preservation and supportprovision contained in the housepassed reconciliation legislation last year 2 9 million children an average of about 8 000 a day were reported abused and neglected more than three children a day died of maltreatment the 1 5 billion included in the house package would help prevent this neglect and abuse and possibly offset more expansive social service programs by providing funds for family support programs that teach parents early how to protect nurture and support their children the funding will help states develop and expand programs for families in crisis to help keep children and parents together and will improve the quality of foster care for those children who cannot be protected at home the senate did not include the family preservation and support program in its version of the budget reconciliation legislation it is my sincerest hope that my house colleagues will prevail with the house provisions today we have the opportunity to tell the world that america values its children and families above all other things that we respect the sanctity of the family unit and will do all we can to support and encourage families to stay together and work for their goals with a vote for the initiatives i have outlined this evening we can begin to erase the social deficits that have plagued our society for more than two decades my dear colleagues let us begin today to secure americas future i yield to the gentleman from washington mr mcdermorrl who is here to support me in this discussion"],

colleges and universities this bill was introduced on august 6 1993 and was approved by the natural resources committee on november 10 1993 many of the historic structures located on historically black college and university campuses are threatened and a significant effort is needed to preserve and protect them the department of the interior in cooperation with the united negro college fund has launched a project to preserve these structures in 1988 a special survey to identify candidates for inclusion in this program generated responses from 46 hbcus nominating 144 structures for consideration the department and uncf eventually selected 11 of the most historically significant and critically threatened structures on such campuses the department and uncf estimate that it will cost 20 million to preserve these particular structures and uncf has agreed to match a departmental contribution of 10 million for this purpose under the hbcu historic preservation initiative however no funds were requested or appropriated for this purpose for fiscal year 1994 h r 2921 as reported by the committee on natural resources authorizes the use of appropriations from the historic preservation fund to provide grants for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at eligible hbcus in fiscal year 1995 a total of 20 million would be authorized 5 million of which may be used only for fisk university and 10 million of which may be used only for grants to those hbcus identified for inclusion in the interior departments hbcu historic preservation

treaty also known as the treaty of rarotonga since it was signed by the leaders of the pacific nations on the island of rarotonga cook islands with ratification of the treaty of rarotonga by eight countries in december 1986 the nations of the south pacific have created a nuclearfree zone in the region to combat the specter of nuclear proliferation i am proud to have introduced this measure that symbolizes americas sensitivity on this issue of tremendous concern to the peoples of the south pacific i also want to express my deepest appreciation to the original cosponsors of house concurrent

abercrombie and the honorable patsy mink the distinguished delegation from the great state in the pacific hawaii i submit thee statements of my colleagues for the record in august 1989 my colleagues former house asiapacific affairs chairman stephen solarz representatives robert dornan and i traveled to the south pacific meeting with the leaders of the island nations to discuss pressing concerns of the region and americas role in addressing those needs next to the threat of uncontrolled drift net fishing in the south pacific by foreign fleets foremost in the minds of these island leaders was our countrys lack of support for the treaty of rarotonga with the cessation of drift net fishing in the south pacific the failure of the united states to join the spnfz treaty has become the most crucial issue in the region the treaty of rarotonga constitutes a symbol for the peoples of the south pacific expressing their high level of concern regarding nuclear weapons and the possibility of a nuclear holocaust in the region by refusing to sign the treatys protocols while the soviet union and the peoples republic of china have done so the united states is increasingly portrayed as being insensitive to the needs and desires of its allies in the south pacific if there were good and valid reasons behind our countrys failure to support their friends in the pacific on thismatter of vital importance to them perhaps i could understand but after lengthy review and analysis it is clear that the treaty of rarotonga and its protocols would not undermine unitedstates security practices or military operations in the south pacific whatsoever past administrations while testifying before congress on the spnfz treaty have conceded this point this is reflective of the fact that our allies carefully drafted the document at every stage to accommodate unitedstates interests provisions in the treaty for example specifically protect our nations right of air and sea passage through the treaty zone by american planes and ships carrying nuclear weapons moreover we would not be setting precedent by signing the nuclearfree protocols of the treaty of rarotonga that ground was broken decades ago when the united states signed and ratified the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons in latin america a document substantially identical to the treaty of rarotonga protocols the united states is also a signatory to the nuclear free zone prohibitions contained in the antarctic treaty the seabed arms control treaty and the treaty on principles for outer space exploration furthermore our great nation has supported the possible formation of nuclear free zones in the south asia subcontinent the middle east and africa the nations of the south pacific rightfully ask why we have demonstrated concern for the threat of nuclear devastation to latin americans and the inhabitants of antarctica the sea floor and outer spaceyet we refuse to show such sensitivity to the aspirations of the peoples of oceania our countrys lack of responsiveness to the south pacifics call for a nuclearfree zone cannot help but also be seen by those in the region as tacit encouragement for france to resume her longcriticized nuclear testing program in the pacific after over 100 nuclear bombs have been detonated deep within french polynesias mururoa atoll it has been described by scientific researchers as a swiss cheese of fractured rock leakage of radioactive waste from mururoa atolls underground test sites to the surface waters and air has been predicted and is inevitable this embodies the environmental nightmare that the inhabitants of the south pacific have long dreaded it is not surprising that reports of increased cancer rates amongst tahitians have surfaced the damage to the marine environment can only be imagined when france announced her nuclear testing moratorium last year the news was occasion for great celebration throughout the pacific in looking at the environmental havoc that is a necessary byproduct of nuclear testing one need only study our countrys experience in the pacific after the united states detonated nuclear devices in the 1940s and 1950s on bikini and rongelap atolls in the marshall islands the ravaging effects of nuclear radiation on the islands environment and its former inhabitants are still evident today as a member from the pacific region i have grown up immersed in the controversy of nuclear testing for a long time this issue has been in the forefront of my mind since childhood we pacific islanders know from firsthand experience the horrors of nuclear testing even now decades later the legacy of the unitedstates testing program in the marshall islands is still being felt people there have not forgotten memories of the offspring of pacific islander women infected by radiation falloutwhere babies were born dead that didnt look human and were termed jelly babies these people of the pacific are still trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives and culture our great nation learned a lesson from its pacific experience that should never be forgotten as a result we have stopped our nuclear testing in the south pacific in the face of that experience and in light of united states support of nuclearfree zones around the world how can we sit idly by while our friends in the pacific ask for our help in stopping nuclear madness in the fragile marine environment of the south pacific the world stands at a moment in time where we either move forward toward global peace and harmony or we step back and

4604 the budget control act of 1994 last year the congress passed a landmark 5year deficitreduction program that act was designed to reduce the federal deficit by 500 billion over 5 years through a combination of revenue increases entitlement cuts and a freeze on discretionary spending the 1993 deficitreduction act is working and working well the deficit is on a downward path after rising steadily year after year since fiscal 1989 some private economists and the congressional budget office expect the budget deficit to fall to 200 billion or less in the current fiscal year that figure is down from the record 290 billion in 1992 and down from 255 billion in 1993 the 1993 deficitreduction law included provisions reducing entitlement spending in future years obviously those provisions were based on certain assumptions about economic conditions and the resulting levels of entitlement spending that would occur in the future economic conditions can change very quickly driving entitlement spendingand the deficitup sharply in a relatively brief period of time the budget control act of 1994 will establish a mechanism to safeguard the deficit reduction achieved in last years reconciliation act h r 4604 will create a process whereby the president and congress will review annually through fiscal 1997 the entitlement portion of the federal budget except for social security net interest and deposit insurance this review will compare spending on entitlements in the previous year the budget year and the 4 succeeding years to targets established pursuant to the bill the targets would be set by the office of management and budget within 30 days of enactment and would be based on spending resulting from laws enacted as of 5 days before omb set the targets to set the targets omb would use the assumptions underlying last years budget resolution to the extent feasible omb would adjust the targets each year to reflect changes in beneficiary populations legislated net revenue increases and spending resulting from legislation designated as emergency under the budget enforcement act if the annual review reveals that entitlement spending exceeded or will exceed the target in any year by more than onehalf of 1 percent then the president would have to include in his budget recommendations for addressing the overage to eliminate the overage the president could recommend any combination of cuts in entitlements reductions in discretionary appropriations or revenue increases in the event the president finds an overage the house budget committee must include in a separate section of the budget resolution provisions instructing the appropriate committees to report legislation cutting spending or increasing revenues these instructions must call for savings equal to or exceeding the total recommended by the president for action up to the full amount of the overage in the event the budget committee failed to report a budget resolution addressing overages then the presidents recommendations could be brought directly to the floor for a vote if a budget resolution proposes to offset less than the full overage found by the president the budget committee must report a resolution directing the government operations committee to report legislation increasing the targets by the amount of the overage not offset this mechanism is intended to create an opportunity for a separate vote on raising the targets if the budget committee does not fully address an overage the bill contains enforcement measures to prevent congress from circumventing its obligations first it would not be in order to consider a budget resolution addressing less than the full overage until the separate vote on raising the targets had occurred second a budget resolution conference report must fully address any overage found by the president either through spending cuts revenue increases or target increases or be subject to a point of order third it would not be in order to consider any appropriations bills in the house until a budget resolution fully addressing any overages had been agreed to mr chairman h r 4604 resembles provisions included in the house version of last years reconciliation bill however parliamentary constraints in the senate prevented the provisions from appearing in final version so the president imposed the requirements on himself by executive order and the house adopted house resolution 235 which imposed procedural requirements on us similar to those contemplated by the bill the presidents fiscal 1995 budget submission included the review required under the presidents executive order for the members information the review indicated that entitlement spending is well within the level assumed last year in fact if all goes well entitlement spending will be 82 5 billion under the applicable target during the 199497 timeframe that is good news for the american people the 5year deficitreduction train is firmly on track the bill before the committee today would codify the process created last year by the president and improve it in one important way it would exclude the social security program from the entitlement review and exclude benefit cuts from consideration as a recommended solution to an overage given the large balances in the trust funds social security could not cause an overage since social security could not cause the problem it ought not be part of the solution including social security in this process would frighten our senior citizens unnecessarily the committee bill

to guam that we can make a break with the past and we can begin the difficult task that confronts us as the prospect of more federal excess lands heightens the tensions on guam and increases the demands for a comprehensive land solution while this bill is not that comprehensive solution it does show that solutions are possible ultimately the best solution is to give guam as much authority as possible to resolve land issues on guam where land issues are most clearly understood just last week i convened a land conference on guam to begin the task of forming a consensus on land issues while

the reality that some business bankruptcies in recent years have involved literally billions of dollars and many thousands of jobsthe profound economic consequences of bankruptcy cannot be overlooked

includes many important provisions the following are some of the highlights we obviate the necessity of bankruptcy judges holding superfluous hearings when debtors with the benefit of representation by counsel seek to reaffirm obligations we seek to facilitate more expeditious resolutions of requests for relief from the automatic stayand we seek to discourage long postponements for filing proposedreorganization plans we encourage greater reliance on chapter 13 of the bankruptcy codean alternative to liquidationby making a broader range of debtors eligible to file under that chapter and contribute income under a repayment plan we provide explicit statutory authorization for bankruptcy judges to conduct jury trials with the consent of the parties when so designated by the district courtthus saving judicial resources in certain situations where the right to trial by jury is guaranteed we give expression to the inappropriateness of penalizing lenders for obtaining loan guaranteespenalties that eventually can constrict credit and increase interest ratesand for that reason effectively overrule the deprizio case we clarify that important bankruptcy code protections for entities that finance or lease aircraft vessels and railroad equipment covera broad range of transactions we modify the automatic stay in response to abuses involving some single asset real estate entities that file under chapter 11 solely for purposes of delay without any expectation of reorganizing successfully we provide additional safeguards for equipment lessors in recognition of problems they often face during the bankruptcy process we clarify judicial authority to issue injunctions in certain circumstances where trusts are created to pay asbestos related claimsbecause we recognize that by removing uncertainty over the validity of such injunctions the value of trust assets available to fund recoveries by victims can increase we safeguard a sellers important right to reclaim

just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily because this continuous spending spree is about to sink this country into debt from which we cannot recover"], [0.9913693070411682, 0.9913693070411682, 0, "i would like to thank my colleague the

today stands divided it stands divided at a time when the rest of the world seems to be moving together the iron curtain has fallen as has the berlin wall jews and arabs in the middle east are coming together and whites and blacks in south africa are moving toward peace and democracy although as we have heard in recent weeks there will be setbacks along the way but even with the efforts for peace

the dark thoughts of hopelessness peace is not easy reunification is not an easy way but it is in the end the only way just a few short months ago prospects for peace in ireland were not strong but today after the issuance of the joint declaration of peace by prime ministers reynolds and major in december and developments over the last few months i think most observers find themselves thinking positively about the situation in northern ireland we have a chance now to move forward toward a united ireland prime minister major said yesterday in referring to the violence in northern ireland that strong support for peace coming from america can play a part in this i guess we should add tonight that strong support for unity coming from britain can also play a major part in this i for one pledge my support for the principle of peace in northern ireland and for making at long last ireland a free and united 32county ireland clearly the irish people overwhelmingly support efforts for peace they are tired of the violence the american people and the american political leadership here in the congress and in the administration should be as well it is time for all parties to the dispute to sit down and work out an accord and whatever steps we can take as americans to accomplish this noble goal should be taken just as we have across the globe eight hundred years of conflict 25 years of increasing violence more than 3 500 lives lost women children infants the frail and elderly countless innocent bystanders have been brutally and violently murdered it is time to make it stop there is no easy solution but the first steps toward unity are a willingness to negotiate whether you are from britain or northern ireland or the republic whether you are a unionist a republican or a nationalist put aside your differences clear your minds and make a goodfaith effort to arbitrate this dispute now is the time for peace and unity in northern ireland i urge other members of this house

all politics is local and he remembered that tip knew that government ought to be caring and that all the regulations in the world didnt give anyone in government an excuse to be uncaring even though

and recalled a story or two the first time i met him i mentioned i was from the town of danvers tip immediately recalled the name of a friend of his from dan vers a friend who had helped him out some 30 or so years before i thought it remarkable that after all those years tip would remember someone and not someone who tip had helped because even then tip had helped hundreds of people tip remembered someone who had helped him tip also didnt shy away from controversy or a fight if that was what was needed as the current speaker of the house mentioned tip oneill was the first speaker of

approved by the united states and over 100 other countries is the largest trade agreement in history and the largest tax cut in history it represents a 744 billion cut in tariffs worldwide and a 12 billion tax cut for americans the united states is the worlds largest trading country and will be the biggest winner from the gatt right now over 10 million americans owe their jobs to exports and because trade is where the jobs of the future are coming from that number will grow significantly once gatt is approved in fact gatt will create hundreds of thousands of jobs that will pay 12 to 22 percent more than average nonexport related jobs in my home state of ohio exports currently support 370 000 jobs and gatt will allow the 5 200 ohio businesses which export goods to expand their workforce even more under gatt key industries in ohio will benefit from reduced tariffs they include transportation equipment industrial machinery chemicals electronic equipment auto parts aerospace and agriculture for example ohios largest export transportation equipment will see import tariffs reduced by 40 to 80 percent foreign duties on industrial machinery ohios fastest growing export will be reduced and in some cases totally eliminated the united states is already reaping the benefits from nafta in fact despite the predicted great sucking sound in 1994 increased exports under nafta will support 100 000 new jobs it promised to increase unitedstates exports and it has delivered in the onehalf of 1994 exports to mexico were up 17 percent and exports to canada were up 10 percent the same scaretactics used by nafta opponents have been used against gatt opponents argue that gatt will produce unemployment will drive up the deficit and will undermine american sovereignty nafta has proven what free trade can do for job creation and economic growth and analysis has found that nothing in the gatt would endanger american independence whenever the united states has joined an international organization such as the united nations or nato the question arises whether unitedstates sovereignty is compromised the fact is that there is nothing in the gatt that could prevent the united states from withdrawing from the world trade organization at any time i do not believe that any world body can force the united states to do something we believe to be against our best interests it should be noted that gatt actually protects the sovereignty of ordinary americans to be as free as possible to make economic decisions affecting their lives the gatt agreement upholds the principles which allow entrepreneurs workers and consumers to seek economic opportunities with the least amount of government interference because gatt will promote economic freedom and individual rights it is critical that we move forward and approve this agreement if you believe as i do that america can compete and win in our global economy if you share my desire to allow american businesses to profit from selling their goods worldwide and use those profits to create jobs and if you want america to maintain its leadership in the world of free trade then you willvote yes today despite the pressures from those who would rather close our borders i ask my colleagues not to lose sight of the fact that gatt will benefit not only businesses and their employees it will benefit unitedstates consumers the sooner we implement this agreement the sooner all of us will realize the benefits as with nafta we have little to lose and a lot to gain we can side with protectionism or prosperity however if we make the wrong choice we may face the same future as those countries who in 1947 chose to vote against the first gatt those countries who decided to turn inward are now the poorest

0.4998226761817932, 0, "i wanted to talk tonight about health care and specifically i wanted to talk about the clinton proposal and then talk a little bit about the michel alternative the reason why i want to do this is because there are a lot of health care plans that are out there right now i am glad that there are a lot of plants out there there are plans offered in the senate there are plans offered in the house by republicans and by democrats and certainly by the administration but let us face it the president is a 500pound gorilla therefore his health care plan is center stage and that is the plan i am going to talk to address tonight i want to sy up front though that i am not in favor of his plan and i want to talk to you about that and explain why in doing so i will explain the goals and the mechanics of his plan and what i see are the good parts and the bad parts first of all let me say this that the plan has three basic goals i know that they actually say six goals but there are three basic goals security savings and simplicity security universal coverage everyone in america will have health care despite your income employment age medical status whatever you will have health care that health care will be portable if you quit one employer and go to another no problems satisfying a preexisting condition portion of a policy you can take it with you you will have a guaranteed benefit plan without cancellation every american will have an insurance card with this cared you can get health care coverage anywhere you want to go and it cannot be cancelled i think that has some interesting ramifications aside from health care because this plan will also register you as a resident of america no matter where you are and so i would think that this card could also be used for criminal investigation and background checks i only say that in passing because i think there is something there that bears investigation this health care bill is a 1 600page bill and we need to know what is in all the parts of it now aside from the goal of security the plan also has savings the idea is that each individual in america will pay about 1 800 for health care and families will pay about 4 200 the idea behind the savings is that you will have more people in spreading the risk more people participating in the program because we will not just have 215 million insured people we will have an additional 37 million now the presidents plan does not address the fact of what happens if all those 37 million cannot pay but this is part of the idea of savings the third goal of his plan is simplicity onestop shopping you will get your health care through a health care alliance now there is simplicity for the individual maybe for the shopper but there are a little bit more problems for the bureaucracy because according to one study the plan will actually create 59 new federal programs expand 20 others and begin 79 new federal mandates and changes in our tax laws that is not exactly simple it reminds me of the saying i am from the government i am here to help i do not know that that will help or not but remember we are looking at a 1 600page bill these are the goals of the presidents plan the mechanics how does it work step no 1 creating a national health care board with seven fulltime directors now health secretary shalala said that these directors would actually have minor responsibilities later she went back and said well i meant it would be minor the number of people who actually serve on the board but included in their duties no matter what you call them is that they would outlaw certain insurance practies and change certain policy rules and preempt a number of state laws that affect insurance insurance has been regulated by the mccarranferguson act which says as long as states regulate insurance the federal government would not get into the roll well this bill i would think in effect repeals mccarranferguson particularly as respects health care the board would also establish community rates remember we talked about this health care card one thing about it you and i everyone in amerlea will have it but what is interesting to note is if you are a 23yearold marathon runner or a 55yearold person who does not ever exercise you may smoke a little bit too much you may drink a little bit too much you may eat a lot of fried foods and never exercise your premium is going to be the same as the 23yearold marathon runner i do not like that idea i think that you should have personal responsibility and that people who take care of themselves should pay a lower premium than those that do not as one friend but it in the automobile business it would be similar to charging somebody who has absolutely no speeding tickets and somebody who has several duis and five speeding tickets the same premium where is the personal motivation another thing the national health care board will do is define the benefit package decide what is covered in the policy and what is not and then and maybe most importantly they will decide what protocols and what procedures are appropriate for health care providers as i read it there is not a provision that national health care board members or the alliances under them have to be medically trained but they will be telling doctors what procedures are and are not appropriate that is step no 1 step no 2 by january 1 1997 each state will have to set up a series of health care alliances the health care allianpes will act like a btoker they will tell customers which network has what sort of plan what their service record has been they will also have a report card where they publish the performance of the different networks they monitor the claims and collect all kinds of data but the alliance is a governmentcreated monopoly you will have to buy your health care through an alliance that means if you are happy with your current coverage if you are one of the majority of americans that surveys show that you like the plan you are under right now you will have to surrender that you will have to get it through an alliance that is the second step the third step and actually it goes at the same time as the setting up of the alliance that would be requiring or pushing and encouraging health care providers to join a network that would be your doctors your hospitals your nurses your physical therapists all your health care delivery folks will get together and decide how much they would charge for delivering your health care from a to z the alliance would offer you three different types of programs no 1 the standard no 2 an hmo or ppo health maintenance organization or preferred provider organization type coverage and then no 3 fee for service fee for service is basically what we are doing right now it is the type coverage you have right now where you pay for service a fee and then the doctor charges the insurance company for it the only problem is under this plan nobody will be going under a feeforservice program because the economies of scale will all be under the standard plan now what coverage is provided under the standard plan do not think standard means economy i would call it deluxe where i come from but up here in washington they call the following standard coverages well baby care hospice no limit outpatient care catastrophic care home health care longterm care rehabilitation services eye glasses for children substance abuse preventive care abortion and massage therapy that is the standard plan and that is what is supposed to save us money hardly a basic policy by anybodys definition now that i have described that let me go into what the cost is as we all know the administration has been rather vague on how this plan will be financed and what sort of taxes will be raised as a result of it the one thing that the president stood up here a few feet behind me and said is there would be no broadbased new taxes well broadbased taxes in many respects are the fairest kind to have and it is the kind that would ask for the smallest amount of contribution instead the president said we are going to raise taxes on cigarettes well for you smokers out there you are going to need to triple and quadruple your smoking consumption because at current consumption we will only pay for about 5 percent of the care let us not fool ourselves we can beat up on tobacco and cigarette smokers all we want it is not going to do a thing it is not going to carry the burden it will not finance this massive new bureaucracy and plan the president also talked about a 12percent reduction in medicaid and medicare costs now they did not quite define that we are not sure exactly what they mean by that another thing that they talked about was controlling the premiums paid to insurance companies by paying less for claims according to ira magaziner as quoted in the new york times this will cut our waste and reduce overpayments to doctors this is extremely important i want to digress a little bit on this point for that reason i have a woman that i met in my district in savannah ga she is a german citizen her name is ann schweistris unfortunately i have a difficult time pronouncing regular english with my accent so i cannot venture into german her father was 81 years old and had a heart attack in germany he went to get health care he was still living he needed a bypass he needed some medical procedures unfortunately because he was not a wage earner anymore he was put in the back of the line he went along back and forth with the socialist health care system with the nationalized medicine in germany trying to get in the front of the line so he could get treatment he did not five months later he died he did it because the government of germany decided they were going to spend x number of dollars on heart care and bypasses and because they put a limit on it then they would have to decide who was going to get those dollars and who was not from a nonhumanitarian point of view certainly a 33yearold wage earner would come in front of an 81yearold man who was no longer a wage earner one of them paid taxes the other one did not so her father died a few years earlier than he would have you can imagine the pain and agony that that led to her family that is why ann lives in the united states of america today yet she is horrified that we seem to be going in the direction of germany and other countries that have nationalized medicine because of this one part that we will paying less to insurance companies for claims and that is going to be a trickledown effect the big word for it is rationing plain and simple another thing to get back to my list of other coverages or other ways that the president wants to cover the cost by the year 2000 no prices will be allowed to increase except for inflation again more rationing a decrease in fraud we all want to decrease fraud tell us how i support that then there is the grindon small businesses employers small businesses will pay 80 percent of the health care premium of their employees up to 7 9 percent of their payroll the other 20 percent will be paid for by employees many employers do not pay that benefit right now it is part of their compensation package the president is going to jump that line of contractual obligation between employer and employee and say this is how you have to do it there is not discretion at all for businesses many of the small businesses that i have talked to the pet stores the clothing stores the car service garages they are saying forget it we will close down our margin is too thin right now we cannot afford to pick up 80 percent of the cost finally and the one that even some of the liberal media institutions in the washington area have a difficult time with they said that 51 billion will come from the fact that businesses will be making more profits because they will not have to pay higher health care premiums therefore they will be paying new taxes and we think this is going to be in the neighborhood of 551 billion i those are pretty nebulous ideas i would love to have an airplane i would go home go back and forth from my district to georgia and washington each week i would love to have airplane and just commute a little more often but the fact is i cannot afford an airplane this is what happens though when you let your heart do your thinking for your head you have to merge the two you have to have humanitarian goals but you have to have a bottom line you have to remember that this is paid for with tax dollars that are competing with dollars for everything else let me talk about the good points for this plan and the bad points a good point is that the president has brought this to the front burner and that congress has let the issue become predominant there have been other health care reform bills introduced in the past both by republicans and democrats but it has never gotten to the front burner i salute the administration for that the portability i like the idea that somebody will not have job loss i think that is a good idea certainly i would not doubt the presidents sincerity i think he does want the american people to save money he does want to increase security i think those are all good let me get down to the down side i know i have already made a few comments along the way about that just to take a few examples choice you will not have your choice under the presidents plan he is saying that you will have choice but remember he called a tax increase a contribution so you have to watch what he is saying you will have your choice of doctors if your doctors are all in the same network the average american family generally has an internist has a gynecologist and has a pediatrician if all three of those doctors are in the same network and you happen to choose that network yes you have the choice however if they go to different networks you will not have your choice in doctors that is extremely important to remember the rate discrimination that i talked about earlier what motivation is there for you to take care of yourself and have an annual mammogram or pap smear or prostate test and exercise and drink the right things eat the right things if your premium is going to be the same it does not matter certainly you are going to enjoy good health for it but i think we should really encourage people to remember in america if you try a little harder there is a break to it but that incentive is taken out of this plan increased bureaucracy there is absolutely no question that this plan will increase the bureaucracy in my area we have a lot of beautiful live oak trees all of them started out with a tiny little acorn and they grew that creates something real pretty but a bureaucracy grows the same way and it does not create something as pretty as a live oak tree that is what this will do you can talk about your sevenmember national health care board but it is going to grow these alliances are going to grow they are quasigovernmental even from the inception the track record of government is to grow and grow and grow and this will create more bureaucracy another problem it will preempt state laws in my state in georgia the georgia insurance commissioner the governor the chairman of the insurance committee in the legislature are all working for health care reform they have different ideas on it they have different plans but they are working on that reform under this scenario whatever they do will be lost because this will basically preempt state laws and supersede whatever reforms are passed on the state level what is bad about that if the state of georgia does something that is not in georgias best interests it can turn around and reverse that policy quickly however if it comes out of washington you are basically stuck with it what works in georgia might not work in south carolina what works in alaska which is a sparsely populated state wont necessarily work in new york what works in california is going to be different from arizona that is why we have state governments and state legislatures but this plan will wipe all that out finally let me remind the members you would have to surrender your current policy if you are happy with your current policy it will not matter you have to give it up and buy through the alliance these are problems with the presidents plan that we all need to be aware of because this plan is going to affect all of us alternatives i am happy to say there are a lot of alternatives the one i prefer is the one that bob michel has introduced in the house it has a number of aspects no 1 for the universal appeal of it it says that small businesses will have to offer health care to their employees but the financing mechanism and the choice of coverage and plans will strictly be up to the employee and the employer but they will have to offer it that dialog will take place the fact is many small businesses for various reasons do not want health care they may be getting it through their spouses policy they may be willing to chance it but that s their choice this is america this is a free country the government sfould not be telling you what you can and cannot do in terms of health care another part of the michel bill which actually is in the clinton plan and i do need to point that out is 100 percent deductibility for small businesses currently proprietorships partnerships sole proprietors they do not have the full deductibility of the health care premium the way large corporations do this plan and the clinton plan will give them 100 percent deductibility i think that is good the michel plan also has portability of coverage i believe that is good the michel plan however allows you to keep your current coverage if you want to do that the michel plan also has a medisave account the way a medisave account works is that the employer instead of just funding strictly a premium which goes to an insurance company actually would buy a catastrophic coverage for you a policy and then have the balance that would fund a large deductible a 2 000 or 3 000 deductible so the employee would be covered in the event there was some catastrophic illness but in the meantime for your broken arms and your stitches and colds and so forth the employee would be spending money out of that fund and whatever is left over would go straight to the employees pocket the idea behind that and one that i think is very important is that in america we can tell you how much cars cost even though we doht necessarily own that type of car we can tell you how much houses cost in another neighborhood we can talk to you about the price of a new tv when it comes to a broken arm no one has any idea you dont know if it is a 50 medical cost to set an arm or if it is 500 or if it is 272 we dont know let us educate and empower consumers so they can know what a fair price is and they can shop for a fair price given that opportunity i believe we will have competition in health care and we will drive the cost down finally the michel plan allows small businesses and institutions to form various purchase groups these various purchase groups would act as clusters so that small business could enjoy the economies of scale that large corporations enjoy those are some of the alternatives offered by the michel plan again there are a lot of plans there are plans there is one by senator chasee wellstone cooper senator graham the gentleman from iowa has one in the house i think it is important there are a lot of plans i think this is very important because we are talking about such a large issue an issue that touches every single american although i think it is important we always talk about 37 million people who do not have health care but we never talk about the 215 million who do have health care a 1900 one of the things that was in the investors business daily on october 25 was an article that discussed the combosition of the 37 million people and in it they talked about the fact that the majority of them are workers who have temporarily lost their benefits because they are in between jobs and then it said the other portion of the 37 million are 18yearold college students nonworkers and spouses and indigents so we are not necessarily talking about the same 37 million people we are talking about a 37 million group that passes through that turns over a lot i would never stand here and tell you that we do not need health care reform but i would stand here and say we have got to look at everything very very carefully incidentally the same article says that in 1988 the level of uninsured was the same as it is 1993 we should have started health care reform in 1986 obviously but i only stress this to say the urgency is no worse today than it was 5 or 6 years ago we talk about medical inflation here is a statistic in the same article that said that in 1981 the health care inflation was 9 6 percent and in 1974 it was 12 percent all of these statistics get somewhat lost in the argument and that is why i want to bring them out because i think it is very important i am glad again that the president has brought this important debate before congress and the american people but i want to say that there are a lot of alternatives and before we run off into a socialist medicine program we need to be very careful and preserve the good things about our current delivery system and try to stay away from more

actually in the legislation at the present time what the law really is allowing permanent replacement workers is not the same as allowing an employer to fire an employee for engaging in a lawful strike and my opposition to h r 5 isnot tantamount to a sapction of union busting i support wholeheartedly the protections in the current law that are extended to economic strikers and would oppose further infringement on the lawful exercise of the right to strike among these statutory protections are the fact that economic strikers remain statutory employees eligible for recall until they obtain regular and substantially equivalent employment and they remain eligible to vote in union elections for 12 months employers are prohibited from engaging in surface bargaining to instigate a strike so nonunion replacement workers can be hired likewise employers may not grant additional benefits to either temporary or permanent replacement workers nor may they presume that replacement workers do not support the union for purposes of their duty to bargain that is what the law is presently it has worked well for 55 years it needs some fine tuning as i indicated when this oame before us during the last session of congress but we should not be throwing out the entire legislative process that has worked so well and all of a sudden substitute something totally new in talking to my labor people back home the big fine tuning that they see is necessary is to get the national labor relations board to make decisions promptly on unfair labor practices but this is a mass rewriting of the law if we need a mass rewriting then certainly we should wait for the secretarys commission that he has for labor law reform i am not arguing as i said that it is perfect i have indicated in the past that it may be 51 to 49 52 to 48 in favor of management however the legislation before us changes that totally in that it is now 75 percent labor to 25 percent management at a time when everyone says we want to make sure that we get more people working we want the economy to recover we keep bringing legislation over and over again that has the opposite effect we are in a very competitive wdrld what we did in the 1950s 1960s and 1970s will not serve us well in the 21st century if we cannot get labor management and government working handandglove as they do in many other countries we are not going to be the successful nation we are presently this legislation will drive us in the opposite direction in fact i do not hear the president running around encouraging people to pass this legislation he says he will sign it but he has not encouraged anyone he has not been pressuring anyone let us take time if we are going to make major changes in this legislation folks and let us not precipitously do something we will be sorry for and which will set us back dramatically in labor relations and also in our economic recovery and improvement"], [0.0002560615539550781,

run again here was one great fellow who was leaving voluntarily when he seemed to be so young and energetic and in the prime of his life we hated to see him go at that time but we know from his

appreciate the chairs indulgence let me be perfectly clear the gentleman from alabama and the gentleman from indiana have brought to the floor a good bill we are not surprised that they have brought forward a good bill that is what we are used to from chairman bevill and mr myers the only problem with it as i see it is the provision relating to the superconducting super collider i expect the vote tomorrow of the full house to speak to that issue and then we can all enthusiastically support this fine piece of legislation but i think we should all be aware of the headlines which make it easier to dissolve the ssc cult for now let me just cite a few of the most telling examples the general accounting office new estimates that the ssc will cost a minimum of 11 billion to build an increase of almost 53 billion over last years figure keep in mind the steady progression it started out in 1985 at 4 4 billion and then it went to 5 2 billion then it went to 5 9 billion and then it went to 8 2 billion now the general accounting office tells us and it is yet to be more than 17 percent completethat the projected cost is in excess of 11 billion so we are talking about 200 percent over the original projection item the department of energy in spector general reports that the ssc managers juggled the books to make it look like they were exceeding their goals for minority 6ontracting when actually they failed to meet them and it is veryimportant to note that the department of energy accepts these findings item the secretary of energy who appeared before our science committee in her maiden appearance on capitol hill she said at that time that she has no passion for this project and i can understand why the secretary of energy echoing her predecessor acknowledges that foreign contributions for the collider are unlikely to exceed 400 million considerably less than project supporters have repeatedly promised now keep in mind that this house by a substantial overwhelming bipartisan vote 2 years ago addressed this issue and we said a minimum 20 percent foreign contribution would be required to go forward that minimum 20 percent foreign contribution has not been forthcoming item the latest inspector generals report accuses ssc managers of imprudent spending a lack of cost controls which is a recurring lament and worst of all a deliberate effort to thwart auditors there are going to be some people during this debate who would address the nickels and dimes and suggest that oh they had a christmas party for their employees what is wrong with that i am not offended by that what i am offended by is a project that is billions of dollars in cost overruns in short while the superconducting super collider managers have not yet reached the level of arrogance and selfindulgence and secrecy and undependability exhibited by rasputins patron the czar they are getting there let us topple this regime let us put the project to bed and go on with higher

the rules committee report on house resolution 226 proposes to insert at the appropriate place a new section entitled youth fair chance program on thursday july 22 1993 the house rejected house resolution 220 which provided on page 2 beginning at line 10 the following the modification to the bill printed in part 1 of the report of the committee on rules accompanying this resolution shall be r msidered as adopted in the house and in the committee of the whole and part 1 of the report to accompany that resolution contains an identical modification to that contained in the report on this resolution the report on house resolution 220 proposed to insert at the appropriate place a new section entitled youth fair chance program a careful examination of both reports will reveal that the modifications considered to be adopted in both the house and in the committee of the whole are identicalwordforword this device of having an amendment considered as adopted upon the adoption of the rule is called a selfexecuting provision at what point is the modification considered to be adopted the rule makes clear that it is considered to be adopted in the house and in the committee of the whole and not the reverse we are now in the house and the adoption of the socalled modification takes place first in the house when we adopte this rule then it is considered as adopted in the committee of the whole when the house resolves into committee and finally the language of the rule presumably also extends to the final adoption of the modification when the bill is reported back to the house when it is reported from the committee of the whole but the chair can hardly argue that this rule does not first adopt the modification in the house when the rule is adopted since the order of adoption is quite clearfirst in the house then in the committee of the whole in further support of this i would cite the ruling of the chair of february 24 1993 on a similar point of order brought against the rule on the unemployment compensation bill at page h807 the chair indicated that and i quote the amendments are not adopted until such time as the rule is adopted in other words the amendments are considered as adopted in the house upon adoption of the rule by the same token when house resolution 220 was rejected by the house last thursday the identical amendment to that being offered in this rule was considered as rejected in the house and the point of order lies against considering the same amendment once rejected i therefore urge the chair to follow the logic of its previous ruling regarding the effect of the adoption of a rule by the house by upholding my point of order that this amendment has been previously rejected by the rejection of the prior rule on this bill"]]}
