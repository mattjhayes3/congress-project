leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"], [0.0013565421104431152, 0.9986434578895569, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman kelly for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.0014590024948120117, 0.998540997505188, 1, "our nation is grieving we are tired we are tired of the violence that too often unsettles our communities what a week we had last week we were horrified by the deaths of lorne ahrens michael smith michael krol patrick zamarripa and brent thompsonfive officers murdered by a sniper in dallas while they were on duty we saw very troubling videos of philando castile and alton sterling being shot today we also mark the 1month anniversary of the shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando a hateful act on the lgbt community that took the lives of 49 people this shooting shook the country as have the many mass shootings that have preceded it as we still process these deaths daily violence continues in communities around the country over the weekend the total number of shootings in chicago where i come from this year exceeded 2 100 over 300 people in chicago have now died from gun violence in 2016 i have received hundreds and hundreds of letters from constituents of all ages concerned about the effect of gun violence in our communities and in their communities yesterday i received a letter from a young constituent an 8yearold named kaline she wrote i read the suntimes every day like my dad i read and still think about the story of tyshawn lee its just hitting my mind all the time because its not fair it makes me cry tyshawn lee was a 9yearold boy in chicago deliberately assassinated shot multiple times in the head kaline continues i hope people can make better decisions about what to do with guns i hope people stop fighting about whether we should do gun control because i worry more people and kids like tyshawn will be killed we cant accept violence as normal this is not the country kaline should have to grow up in and how do you explain to an 8year old that in america with 91 people dying from gun violence every single day we have taken no meaningful action we take action all the time to protect our kids from threats to their safety we have regulations in place on teddy bears and pacifiers to protect childrens health and safety but nothing for guns guns are specifically exempted from regulation by the consumer product safety commission the agency charged with protecting consumers from unreasonable risk or injury or death gun manufacturers are protected from liability for damage caused by their weapons the centers for disease control is actually prohibited in law from studying the public health risk of guns robert a 91yearold and a veteran of world war ii from my district wrote you know better than i do the vast array of efforts to protect the american people from the recklessness and avarice in the marketplace yet congress has failed the people in the matter of gun control today the american public is crying for laws he says robert is right i can think of no other product or industry that has so few measures in place to protect our safety and we need to rethink our approach to guns we cant put the interests of gun manufacturers and the gun lobby ahead of the safety of our communities those of us in congress have the power to do something and it is long past time for us to act we can start with measures that have broad support among the american people ninety percent of americans support comprehensive background checks background checks would help reduce the flood of weapons that come into chicago from gun shows and online sales would it stop every shooting of course it wouldnt but would it save some lives absolutely my heart goes out to the families in dallas and orlando and chicago and so many other places that have had the lives of their loved ones stolen away by gun violence and we need to grieve but after that moment of silence we must direct our sadness and our anger into action the problem of violence in communities may seem insurmountable and no single policy will stop every death but we should start by passing commonsense gun legislation supported by the vast majority of the american people we need a vote on legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands republicans and democrats and gun owners and nra members agree that background checks for every gun purchase and closing the gun show loopholes and all the other loopholes will help so give us a vote

bridging the divide a call to action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities i would like to thank my colleagues congressman hakeem jeffries and congresswoman joyce beatty for hosting this timely special order historically racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care while the affordable care act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities for example the department of health and human services is currently working to expand access end racial and ethnic discrimination perform outreach to underserved communities improve workforce diversity and expand data collection and reporting while this is an ambitious plan it is one that is extremely necessary unfortunately coverage access and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status for example research shows that privately insured african american and hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care unfortunately african americans and hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts the same research also showed that privately insured african americans and hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs since social determinants like economic stability education and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on healthrelated programs reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing affordable food access to education job opportunities communitybased resources public safety public transportation and more our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors i thank congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty for hosting this poignant special order tibet"], [0.0015214085578918457, 0.9984785914421082, 1,

loss of life from guns in this country but one critical tragic aspect of this crime that sometimes has gotten lost is exactly who was targeted in the shooting pulse was a mainstay of orlandos lgbt community and of the latino community in particular now more than ever we need to unite against hatred discrimination and bigotry we need to stand together in calling for justice peace and equality i am frankly appalled to see that today today on the 1month anniversary of the shootings at the pulse nightclub instead of standing with the lgbt community instead of passing background checks today the committee on oversight and government reform will be advancing legislation to undermine the existing and insufficient protections that the law provides for lgbt americans i am proud that my home state of connecticut is one of several states to pass legislation protecting the lgbt community from discrimination whether folks are at work at school at the doctors office or yes using a public bathroom our residents support these laws we support these protections lgbt folks are our brothers our sisters our friends our neighbors they are our kids teachers coaches and their friends they give back to our community they volunteer at church they serve in public office in congress we should be focusing on legislation to prevent discrimination and prevent hatred our goal should be a country in which all americans in every state can live their lives free from bigotry and harassment and free of the fear of being targeted with guns because of who people are quite simply i cant imagine a worse way for congress to respond to the massacre in orlando than with legislation attacking lgbt americans the american people overwhelmingly believe that discrimination targeting the lgbt community has no place in our society and yet a bill to support that discrimination is getting a full hearing today meanwhile legislation to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists that has broad bipartisan support among the public cannot get so much as a vote in this house in the 312 years since the sandy hook massacre in my state in my district in connecticut this house has failed to take any action any action whatsoever to prevent the deaths of americans by guns in that time 100 000 americans have died from guns 49 of them in the largest mass shooting in american history 1 month ago targeted because they are lgbt at the pulse nightclub in orlando it is time to get our priorities straight it is time for us to do what the american people sent us here to do let us send a very clear message we stand up against hatred and discrimination we stand with our lgbt brothers and sisters and we stand with the american people who are demanding that this house take action to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people to keep guns away from terrorists to keep guns away from criminals to keep guns away from domestic abusers and to keep guns away from the dangerously mentally ill we need a vote on no fly no buy we need a vote on comprehensive background checks on every commercial sale of a gun the time to act is now and action is not increasing voting to increase discrimination against our lgbt

caucus it is so important that our message of unity and our messagewhich really describes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are faced withthat that message goes out both of you have really been tremendous in this effort so i rise this evening to join this critical conversation on race relations in america and to challenge our colleagues to work with the congressional black caucus to realize progress for racial justice and equality i join congresswoman kelly and congressman payne in sending my condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in paris lebanon nigeria and also in egypt know that we join in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonights special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to african americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it is manifested in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman payne said so eloquently we are the united states so when one is affected all are affected all across the country at universities like mizzou and yale in places like baltimore and ferguson and in high schools like spring valley high in columbia south carolina we are witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at berkley high school in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but i am so proud of the students at berkley they walked offit was not only black students it was all studentsand marched out peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete this crisis isnt limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee and the congressional black caucus more than one in three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions mind you now that is preschool that is students from about 2 years old to 4 years old black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment i cant figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is expelled from school that is outrageous yet 42 percent of preschool student expulsions are african american babies these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start outside of the classroom african americans are overpoliced overcriminalized and underemployed a report published by the new york times in april found that there are an estimated 1 5 million black men between the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life just missing it these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession this must be our call to action that is why i am so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it is time for congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter and black students matter earlier this month i held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second forum that i have held throughout the last 3 months now i have been able to reach over 1 000 east bay residents so tonight in this dialogue which congressman payne and congresswoman kelly have talked about this dialogue leads to action hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forums and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it is past time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there is legislation that can start moving the needle forward we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step toward returning some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman sensenbrenner and congressman scott congress should also pass the stop militarizing law enforcement act h r 1232 to stop the militarization of our nations police forces we also should pass the police accountability act h r 1102 and the grand jury reform act h r 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that there is more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening america we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldnt continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and should ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the ineligibility for public assistance and food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african american men and latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we have the whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which i am proud to chair with our whip mr hoyer we are working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to advance policies that give all families including african american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities a fair shot this effort includes our half in ten act h r 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that is more than 22 million americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act h r 2721 would create goodpaying jobs it would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give african americans and people of color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers my mentor the honorable congresswoman shirley chisholm used to say if they dont give you a seat at the table bring in a folding chair that is what our young people are doing around the country so i want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep fighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all which means just that it means for all in doing so we will make the

families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear that the american people need

10 years people on the terrorist watch list tried to buy explosives or firearms 2 233 times over 90 percent of the time they were successful this is wrong the american people know it is wrong public health officials know it is wrong and nearly every single law enforcement association in america knows it is wrong which is why they are all in favor of closing the terrorist gun loophole in fact a

banning individuals on the terrorist watch list from being able to legally buy guns ninety percent of americans support strengthening and expanding our background check system there are two bipartisan prosecond amendment bills that would do just that the first bill h r 1076 known as the no fly no buy was introduced by our republican colleague peter king this bill says that if you are on the fbis terrorist watch list then you dont get to walk into a gun store pass a background check and leave with the weapon of your choice if there is one thing both sides of the aisle should be able to agree on it is keeping guns away from suspected terrorists bring that bill up for a vote the second bill h r 1217with 186 coauthors democrats and republicanswould close a dangerous loophole in our background check system that allows criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check altogether and instead purchase their guns online or at a gun show or through a classified ad this is a huge loophole and it costs lives you dont have to look any further than the sister of elvin daniel from wisconsin his sister zina had a restraining order against her husband which prevented him from passing a background check when he tried to buy a gun in a store nevertheless zinas husband was able to go online and buy the same gun a 40caliber semiautomatic handgun and he took that gun and used it to kill zina and two other people in a store in wisconsin this bill would close these kinds of loopholes and help stop criminals from getting guns everyone says they want to keep guns away from dangerous people but the only way to know if someone is dangerous is to conduct a background check background checks are our first line of defense against criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill in getting guns last year 260 members of this houseincluding 76 of my republican colleaguesvoted to fund the background check system at

50 percent in 2015 in many ways this is a private market at work as investors demand that boards and management be more responsive to their request for how to improve the company and their longterm performance a number of regulatory hurdles still need to be overcome to improve the unitedstates proxy system which remains one of the primary ways in which public companies communicate between the two back in 2010 the sec put forth a number of ideas the socalled proxy plumbing concept release which explored various ways to improve the transparency if you will of corporate government systems here in the united states importantly the proxy plumbing concept release also discussed at length the importance of getting retail investors more involved in the process for a variety of reasons retail investors have for years been disenfranchised by the current proxy system and they rarely exercise the rights of shareholders to engage in improving the way that the companies work unfortunately for nearly 6 years the sec has and maybe not surprisingly allowed this proxy plumbing concept release to languish and has chosen not to act on it even on some of the most basic and noncontroversial parts of it but then last year out of the blue sec chair mary jo white had directed the sec staff to develop a rulemaking for what is known as universal proxy ballots you ask what are universal proxy ballots good question put simply while they sound quite benign actually universal proxy ballots are a means for special interest groups to easily then nominate their preferred candidates to a companys board and that would fundamentally change things it would fundamentally change the way in which public company directors are elected here in the unitedstates this is an initiative that has been pushed for years by insiders and special interests it has also been pushed by a number of activist pension funds many of which have been horribly managed themselves and now find themselves with unfunded liabilities that threaten the retirement security of the public sector workers over which they were responsible the adoption of the universal proxy rule would only increase the likelihood of high profile proxy fights at public companies which would then serve to distract the employees and management of these companies from carrying out their core mission more importantly it would make the vast majority of public company shareholders including the smaller retail investor pay the price for the costs associated with these big fights finally it is unfair to those investors who do not wish to carry the water for these special interests aside from these specific policy concerns there are also issues of how the sec has been prioritizing its finite resources the sec recently missed the rulemaking deadline for yet again another congressional mandate to simplify and modernize our current corporate disclosure regime this is an initiative that has bipartisan support and would help boost confidence by making quarterly and annual reports more effective for the small investor by reducing some of the unnecessary and the not material disclosures within them

000 is not fiscally responsible look who pays the difference if somebody is killed or if somebody is rendered for example a paraplegic they are going to incur incredible amounts of medical bills they are not going to be able to work who picks up the difference when that happens it is the social security system it is the medicare system it is john q taxpayer that ends up paying the bill when the trucking company doesnt have enough insurance to pay the damages that is why it is fiscally prudent that we allow the fmcsa to continue its important work and it is important work that was mandated by the map21 bill that required the fmcsa to do this work it also promotes safe highways because if we raise insurance minimums up to modern and responsible levels that means insurance companies will have to engage in actual real underwriting they will have to go out from the home office and visit the headquarters of trucking companies to make sure they are acting properly and safely and responsibly if they do that if you want to buy insurance at reasonable levels you have to act safely finally this is about personal responsibility if you dont have enough insurance you get away without being personally responsible when these horrendous crashes happen i yield to mr price for a colloquy"], [0.0004935860633850098, 0.500493586063385, 0, "mr chair i think most of us would hope that we wont ever need to use the draft again but i think the agency is an important insurance policy that we can use against unforeseen threats in an emergency in a wartime situation the effects of this amendment could be disastrous this is a small price to pay for an agency that has the potential to avert a crisis should the draft ever need to be reinstated the voluntary military we have maintained for 40 years is certainly the preferred method of defending our nation we have got the besttrained and the bestequipped military in the world but the decision on the issue to support and to maintain the selective service system is a decision that should be made by the department of defense i believe that this is a small price to pay to make sure that we have this ability should we ever

the gentleman just gave that all of those are connected to the national interest if a scientist cant explain that then there are greater problems than we might expect the other point is to repeat what i said a while ago if you oppose the national interest standard you are too late the national science foundation director has incorporated the national interest standard in the current guidelines if

was made aware of it and despite the legislation being identical to last congress bill the cbo had scored it as having a direct spending cost but this was partly because the consumer financial
