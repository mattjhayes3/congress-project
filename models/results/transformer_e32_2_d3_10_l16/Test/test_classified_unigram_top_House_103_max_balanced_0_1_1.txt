today he signed into law the nations first income taxdesigned as a temporary emergency measure to finance the civil war today president clinton is raising taxes to finance his version of a class war of course the administration is not without admirers one master of illusion the great houdini must be smiling down on this chamber today when we blow away the smoke and shatter the mirrors what we get from president clintons taxandspend road show is nowhere near what he claims not the 496 billion in deficit reduction not if we use the cbo numbers because cbo based on their estimates would score it at best at 428 billion in deficit reduction even that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of slower spending growth 4 or 5 years from now and then that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of lower spending in the fourth and fifth years this is the president who said we have all got to use congressional budget office estimates they are the real estimates and we have got to reject accounting gimmicks then he ignored cbos baselines and had his bookkeepers invent their own and counted savings from the 1990 budget agreement twice in order to puff up his deficit reduction numbers and i do not know if that is smoke and mirrors or what but if an accountant on main street did it he probably would go to jail that fact is this package includes about 120 billion in promises of net spending reductions almost all in the third fourth and fifth year 255 billion dollars worth of real net new taxes and user fees and about 53 billion in questionable debt service claims that is what you get when you lay this package against cbos estimates instead of the ones the administration cooked up there will be no net spending cuts in the first year zero and virtually none in the second year this package includes deficit increasing items totaling 62 billion over 5 years this new spending probably seems odd to the american people in a socalled deficit reduction package it is one of the reasons why they are nervous about this bill the largest tax increase in our nations history yes the largest by cbo estimates new taxes in this bill are 275 billion the democrats dispute this and they talk about the 1982 tax act but the cbo scored the 1982 tax act as raising 3214 billion in new taxes instinctively americans know these new tax increases are jobkilling poison for the economy they do not believe for one minute that the democrats tax increases are going to create jobs nor do most of the economists in this country the president claims the vast majority of these taxes will hurt only the rich and that is baloney he must not have read his own bill the socalled rich who are targets for massive retroactive tax increases are the small business men and women who create the vast majority of new jobs heaping higher taxes on those jobs creators translates into fewer jobs for working people perhaps we should remember the socalled luxury tax from the 1990 budget deal it is repealed in this bill because that misguided class warfare scheme backfired and killed the boatbuilding industry try to sock the rich and you drown working men and women simplistic attempts to minimize the impact of the energy tax on american families will not hold water either when the democrats tax transportation they are not just taxing people who pull up to the gas pump they are taxing everything that has to be transported senior citizens are among the hardest hit in this package thanks in particular to increased taxes on their benefits it must make them feel real special to learn that president clintons definition of rich people includes seniors with incomes of just 34 000 and that includes half of their social security benefits now that sounds pretty callous especially since seniors on fixed incomes are the one group of americans for whom lower interest rates serve as a financial curse rather than a blessing yes president clinton would like the american people to believe his own taxes only hurt rich people but with over 40 tax increases and 16 user fees in this package no one should seriously buy that story here is what the taxpayers do understand when he was courting their vote clinton promised the middle class a tax cut now he is raising their taxes he promised to create jobs now he is promising tax increases on employers that will kill jobs he promised 500 billion in deficit reduction he is at least 73 billion short of that at best all of the rate increases in the bill including estate taxes are retroactive to january 1 potentially unconstitutional and the installment payments gimmick for individuals does not change the bottom line he is imposing tax increases on people who have already died i urge my colleagues in the house to reject this bill today let us solve our deficit problem through spending cuts up front not tax increases"], [0.0031473927665501833, 0.0031473927665501833, 0, "i want to thank henry hyde for leading this special order on the october surprise hoax it is important that the american people realize what exactly happened with this october surprise investigation when the democrat majority first pressed for a task force to investigate these charges i said the majority is offering an unacceptable resolution for an unnecessary investigation into unbelievable allegations based on unsubstantiated claims made by unsavory characters now after an 8month investigatlon at a cost to the taxpayers of 4 5 rrlion the october surprise task force conclusively refuted all alegations nde by the proponerls of 1he october surprise conspiracy theory i hate to tell you i told you so but i told you so i belileve now and i have always beleved that thi investigation was not necessary we were told by th majority tvhi there were trowbing llegations those allgatons were not troubling there were preposterous both newsweek and the new republic concluded as much in detailed investigative reports before the democrats even started this committee there is a curious aliceinwondarend logic about all of this first there were a number of october surprise conspiracy theories reported in the media these theories fed off each other repealing the same myths and fentasles in different ways taking unproven assertions and claiming they were undeniable facts quoting dubious sources playing up anything that could damage the reagan campaign team playing down anything that would damage their own case al the sordid ancient ticks of the conspiracy trade but simply by being reported and commented upon in the politcay correct media outlets ihat is the new york tames public television et cetera the conspiracy theories were said by democrats to raihe questions that needed to be answered once that claim was made it was inevitable that a congress dominated by democrats would be asked to provide the answers particularly since it was the antirepublican conspiracy theorists themselves who primarily did the asdng so the house had a costy investigaton based on nothing more than the claim that questions had been raised but questions are raised all the time in the media theories about secret powerful cabals of sinister puppet masters abound why was this particular theory dragged out for so long in the press paid such respectful attention and finally made the subject of two congressional investigations the fact that the questions were raised by disgruntled democratic party partisans shady characters and worldclass international liars was rarely mentioned by democrats when democrats were accused by republicans of partisanship in asking for an investigation based on unproven allegations they held up their hands in pious horror and exclaimed but questions have been raised we must investigate as if they rush to answer all conspiracy theory questions as matter of principle shorn of its sensationalism here is what happened reaganhating political activists and scoundrels concocted a libelous story claiming that ronald reagan or his aides or both deliberately used the hostages for their own political purposes the media reported the story and gave the theorists forums from which to spread the ibel because the story had been reported democrats said there are questions that must be answered and a congressional investigatory committee was formed and funded the theories were as i have said groundless is this going to be the investigative model for our future in the house will the democratic leadership always call for an investigation of conspiracy theories no manner what the source so long as questions are raised will we see democrats rushing to the floor or secretly enlisting the gao to investigate conspiracy theories about president clinton if and when such theories appear if some disgruntled republican who served in the bush administration manages to get a large part of the oped page given to him of the new york times as mr sick dkto offer a wacko conspiracy theory about the president clinton will democrats say questions have been ralsedl and call for an investigation i watch and wait with patient expectation it is also interesting to note the timing of the release of the report i can guarantee you one thing if there had been one bit of evidence that the reaganbush campaign was indeed involved the information would have been on every front page across the nation before the election instead the report concluded that there was no credible evidence of a conspiracy and it was released following the election i commend mr hamilton the very distinguished member from indiana who did a fine job in leading this investigation but lee hamilton should not be forced to waste his valuable time tracking down erroneous outrageous ridiculous allegations he should spend his time on the substantive things he does best things like heading a task force on congressional reform in fact investigations like this should be an item for the joint committee on the organization of the congress we should have better procedures in the house so that we can make certain that we dont form committees to investigate every wild conspiracy theory that hits the halls of congress we should also have a requirement that the minority is always kept informed of gao investigations initiated by the majority we should also prohibit staff from writing to federal judges urging them to release convicted felons from prisons because they proved helpful with secret investigations i appreciate the role that henry hyde both as the republican leader of this task force and as a force for reason during the entire debate i would like to thank him for reminding us all through this special order that the october surprise task force was formed not because the majority wanted to answer troubling questions from credible sources but because there are some who want to cast a shadow on one of the greatest presidents in our history i think the formation of this task force not the work product of the members of that task force symbolizes much to what is wrong with this house after 38 years of majority control"],

should remember george bernard shaws famous quip about second marriages the triumph of hope over experience while i heartily applaud the presidents emphasis on deficit reduction like the famous irish writer i urge my colleagues to focus on experience the problem is the underlying principles of the clinton plan that tax increases will reduce the deficit flies in the face of precedent recent history shows higher taxes lead to more federal spending lower economic growth fewer jobs and ultimately larger deficits we saw budget agreements and this chart reflects those budget agreements that resulted in massive tax increases in 1983 1985 1988 and 1990 in each case you can see from the charts more spending and larger deficits resulted from those tax increases chairman obeys own chart showed us that it was only in the years when congress was forced to restrain spending under the grammrudman act did we see any slowdown in this pace of runaway federal spending and that is reflected in chairman obeys own chart that he has presented us under grammrudman total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 1 1 percent under the 1990 budget agreement with its supposedly stricter than grammrudman spending controls total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 8 4 percent the proof is in the pudding as you can see from this chart here the grammrudman record clearly shows that seriously restraining congress ability to spend is the only real way to achieve progress on the deficit in addition i think it is important to point out actual tax revenues since the 1990 budget deal have fallen by more than 3 25 for every dollar the deal is supposed to raise and the deficit increased from 3 1 percent of gnp in 1990 to 5 percent in 1992 every economic study you look at shows that every dollar in new taxes raised since 1947 has led to 1 59 in new government spending a recent study by citizens agonst government waste showed that the 1990 budget agreement produced 2 37 in new spending for every dollar raised in new taxes that is hardly a formula for real deficit reduction experience shows that excessive government spending not a lack of tax revenues causes massive deficits revenues to the federal government have remained steady at an average of 18 6 percent of gross domestic product between 1965 and 1992 never falling below 17 5 percent at the same time government spending has risen from 17 6 percent of gnp to 23 5 percent in 1992 even more telling tax revenues have grown annually at an 8 percent rate over the past decade but spending has increased at an annual rate of 11 percent during the same time the clinton plan is more of the same with deficits the administration projected to average 250 billion a year and their analysis does not even reflect the blow to the economy of taking 328 billion out of the private sector out of the revenue stream in new taxes 328 billion these new taxes will stifle economic growth destroy jobs reduce revenues and increase the deficit economists across the ideological spectrum are convinced that the clinton tax increases will lead to widespread job loss let us look at a few of their comments david resler of nomura securities puts the cost at 400 000 lost jobs by the end of 1994 from these new tax increases drimcgraw hill says 700 000 jobs will be lost in 1997 and 1998 larry kudlow the chief economist at bear stearns estimates job losses at 3 2 million by 1996 and a reduction in real economic output of 450 billion we are going to have unfortunately i think the votes are there for the huge tax increases and we are going to see the prophecies of these economists realized constricting the economy with higher taxes not only means additional job losses less revenues from taxes higher expenditures for unemployment claims but ultimately larger deficits we all remember the infamous boat tax hike in the 1990 budget agreement that illconceived and shortsighted proposal not only failed to reduce the deficit despite the claims from many that it would do just that but it actually lost revenue the boat tax actually lost revenue because it threw thousands of workers out of their jobs as we now know the government lost the income tax revenues from these workers and increased spending on their unemployment claims the experiences of economies across the globe show that higher taxes and more government lead to longterm economic sluggishness we simply cannot grow the government without seriously stifling the private sector at the same time that the government gets bigger these tax increases stifle the productive private sector and destroy jobs we will not balance the budget or even make a dent in the deficit unless we allow the private sector to operate as the engine of economic growth i hope we can learn something from these economic lessons learned throughout our history economic lessons learned in couptries from mexico to poland but unfortunately lost on many of the politicians in this body when will they learn that free markets less government spending and low taxes are the only solid foundation for real economic growth 1 i urge my colleagues to support real

energy and barge user fee taxes the energy tax hits farmers three times higher production costs higher indirect costs and higher transportation costs production agriculture can not pass on these increased costs the impact is only compounded by the fact that farmers are also consumers and will have to pay higher prices on their consumer products due to the energy tax many articles have reported that agriculture interests were protected when the ways and means committee adopted the democrat amendment regarding a btu tax exemption heres the rest of the story the ways and means committee attempted to make the btu tax more palatable to the agricultural community by exempting diesel fuel utilized for offroad purposes from the supplemental btu tax of 342 per million btus this reduced the tax that farmers will pay on diesel fuel from 8 37 cents per gallon to 3 59 cents per gallon assuming that approximately 95 percent of the 2 8 billion gallons of diesel fuel used per year on the farm qualifies for the limited exemption it would reduce the farmers cost for the btu tax on diesel from 232 million to 107 million per year however some of this savings is reclaimed as the ways and means committee raised the basic btu rate from 257 per million btu to 2 68 per million btus to offset the exemption given to agriculture this has the impact of raising the btu tax on other energy utilized in agriculture by 12 million custom harvesters will be devastated by the proposed btu tax energy is the very core of the harvesting business each year roughly 48 000 gallons of fuel is consumed by the harvesting operations the energy tax could increase their operating costs by more than 4 000 a year custom harvesters face further problems from another proposal in the budget plan which would reduce the deductibility of their meals to only 50 percent this would increase harvesters costs by another 1 000 the american farm bureau has estimated that the proposed btu tax and the adjustments in farm program payments will cost farmers 1 7 billion per year when fully implemented when president clinton promised during his campaign not to raise taxes on the middle class i am sure the rural communities did not know that he intended to do this by lowering incomes fulltime commercial farmers will see their incomes reduced over 2 500 per year due to lower revenues as a result of the tax plan despite cutbacks in other areas of the usda budget the administration proposed that 7 3 billion be added to the food stamp program the irony of the proposed budget is the fact that the administration is requesting approximately 4 billion for low income energy assistance to offset that impact of the btu tax in other words the reason that the agriculture budget is reduced by 3 billion per year is to pay for the increased food stamp assistance which is necessary due to the btu tax the effect on farmers is compounded by this act higher input costs due to the energy tax and lower farm program payments unfortunately the higher cost to agriculture does not end there the house ways and means committee proposal also contains a very convoluted provision which requires diesel fuel to be dyed different colors depending on whether the fuel will be used for onroad or offroad vehicles this provision will require most commercial farmers who have trucks and pickups that run on diesel fuel to purchase new diesel fuel storage tanks and pumping equipment to separate the two fuels the cost of such equipment will probably average between 1 000 and 1 200 per unit somewhere between 400 000 and 500 000 farms will most likely have to install such equipment the total capital cost for the agricultural community will be 500 million therefore the annual capital replacement costs plus annual operation and maintenance costs will be about 70 million per year just to separate their diesel fuel farm cooperative suppliers and other petroleum marketers will also feel the impact of this dying proposal the cost of installing a 12 000gallon tank for a distribution facility is approximately 30 000 to 35 000 this estimate from mobil oil in addition to all the above costs there is another area that has been seldom mentioned in the discussion of the btu tax proposal the administrations btu tax proposal rescinds a 22 5 cent per gallon special tax on fuel set to expire september 30 1995 this tax was part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 which increased the manufacturers excise tax on these fuels by 5 cents per gallon effective december 1 1990 and extended the expiration date for these taxes formally september 30 1993 to september 30 1995 half of the increased 2 5 cents per gallon goes to the general fund of the treasury for deficit reduction rather than to the transportation trust fund therefore these taxes were not and continue to not be subject to the offroad fuel exemption this will cost the agriculture industry 105 million per year the ways and means committee added insuit to to agricultures injuries by adopting the proposal to strike the exemption for ethanol a product of corn from the btu tax the committee provided exemptions for other renewable fuels few things are as renewable as com especially in the state of iowa this budget package increases farmers energy and input costs decreases market development for ethanol and lowers farm program

the red 1 out of the 3 spent by this congress is borrowed money this bill is an insult because under this bill the 4 1 trillion federal debt will get worse much worse the federal debt is so bad that 1 out of every 5 that the american taxpayer sends to washington goes for nothing but interest payments on a national debt and now the democrats in this congress are going to increase the national debt

clinton is wholeheartedly behind that is the north american freetrade agreement i happen to believe very strongly that it is going to be one of the greatest jobcreating mechanisms that we can possibly put into place following along the lines of what was just offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania i would like to say that i stand here once again with a very bipartisan spirit that bipartisan spirit is a desire to try to implement a jobcreating mechanism in this economy over and above the north american freetrade agreement now i liketo pride myself on first being an american and second a republican and i was not a supporter of president clintons when he was a candidate last fall but i was frankly very impressed with more than a few things he said in his campaign and i would like to spend this evening talking about one of those items which he referred to in his campaign i want to talk about the fact that we unfortunately are not utilizing that campaign promise in this reconciliation package which we are going to be considering later on this week i happen to believe that president clintons statement last year that a capital gains differential was very important to job creating and economic growth was a correct one it is one which i have subscribed to all along and based on every bit of evidence that we have seen it is clearly going to play a key role in creating job opportunities in this country now as has been said earlier the president is going to be going on television this evening and he is going to be bringing forth urging the american people to contact those of us members of the congress to support his plan i will say here that while i am a strong supporter of many of president clintons initiatives i will do everything that i possibly can to defeat his plan that he is going to be talking about later this evening because even though he talks about an economic growth component and stimulating small business this plan does anything but that based on the evidence that we have seen in the past now i happen to believe and i made this statement earlier that we in the minority clearly have to offer a very positive economic growth component and in fact shortly after we defeated or after i voted against the initial budget package that the president had and many in the media were saying that republicans were simply trying to block president clintons initiatives they were not offering any positive alternative i introduced h r 1885 a basic 4point plan designed to create jobs stimulate economic growth and bring down the deficit the 4 points include first and i am going to be talking about it in just a couple of minutes a capital gains differential taking the 28 percent capital gains tax rate reducing that to 15 percent second imposing a moratorium on the promulgation of new regulations on the business sector of the economy we know full well that many of the problems that are created in this country come about in large part due to the burden of federal regulations that are imposed on the private sector and under the bush administration we opposed a 90day moratorium on new regulations for the business sector of the economy and there were no catastrophes as a byproduct of that so the second part of the proposal that i have in h r 1885 extends that moratorium on new regulations for the business sector of the economy the third thing that it does very importantly as we look at the deficit and the national debt it imposes what is called the 2 percent solution which is close to a freeze on federal spending and we all know that trying to bring about a freeze in the area of federal spending could go a long way toward turning the corner on that debt and the fourth point is as i said earlier establishment or expanding of individual retirement accounts in the 1981 tax bill which was the only tax bill that i voted for it was known as the economic recovery tax act and we established individual retirement accounts those individual retirement accounts were designed to encourage people to plan and save for retirement put dollars aside so that they would not have to be totally relying on the social security system or other government programs for their survival so what i have in h r 1885 is an expansion of individual retirement accounts allowing for a spousal contribution to that individual retirement account and withdrawals from that individual retirement account for three basic uses first a new home purchase which obviously is very important as we know that the housing industry has historically played a key role in pulling us out of recession second the purchase of very needed health care we are looking at health care reform and it seems to me that being able to withdraw form an individual retirement account would be very beneficial as we look at health care reform and the third thing is education we know that many people are decrying the very sorry state of the educational system in this country and one of the things that i call for in h r 1885 is a withdrawal for education purposes for postsecondary education so it seems to me that this 4point economic package would go a long way toward dealing with the challenges that we have and it is contrary to what many in the media and some on the other side of the aisle have said a positive alternative to the one that has been brought forward and the one which most on our side of the aisle strongly oppose now i want to take a few minutes to talk specifically about the issue of capital gains and the effect that a capital gains tax cut has had in the past and will continue to have first of all if we look at the overall tax rates since 1946 tax rates marginal tax rates have fluctuated from 91 percent at a high to 28 percent and revenues have basically as a percentage of the gross national product remained constant at 19 5 percent we have clearly demonstrated that the only way to increase revenues to the federal treasury is to expand the economy now my friend the gentleman from pennsylvania fias talked about the fact that this gasoline tax increase and other taxes that are in this proposal which the president is going to be talking about in a couple of hours is one which will lead the economy to constrict now how we can possibly expect to deal with the national debt and the federal deficit if we have not an expanding economy but a shrinking economy is really beyond me because most every small businessman and woman and many many others even in big business not withstanding those who went down to the white house the other day to support the plan have indicated to me and to others of our colleagues that we must have growth components there and according to the date that we have gathered from the joint economic committee and from the internal revenue service one of the very best ways for us to gain tax revenues to the federal treasury so that we can turn the corner on the 4 5 trillion national debt and the hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits that we run up each year would be to put into place a meaningful capital gains tax stimulus now in 1978 the top capital gains tax rate was lowered from 50 percent to 28 percent as a result of that tax rate reduction in 1978 we saw at that point an increase in revenues to the treasury from 51 billion to 32 billion in 1986 i would like to ask you to focus your attention if you could on this chart here which basically deals with the level of revenues that have been gained from a capital gains tax reduction versus the level of revenues when we have seen an increase in the capital gains tax cuts now i referred a few minutes ago to the capital gains tax cut which was known as the steiger amendment which in 1978 saw a reduction in the capital gains rate from 50 percent down to a 28percent rate that capital gains tax reduction which started then actually did create an increase in revenues to the treasury i refer to the 1981 economic recovery tax act known as the reagan tax cut we saw the rate reduction take place and we saw a further increase in revenues to the federal treasury this has taken place for a wide range of reasons primarily the fact that we have eliminated the socalled lockin effect whereby people who have a tremendous appreciation hold on to it because the rate of taxation is so high when we have a rate reduction they sell off those items which have a capital gains appreciation and therefore those dollars are going back into the economy the tax revenues come into the treasury and the dollars that the individual investors have been able to accrue are reinvested well in the 1986 tax reduction act known as the tra which i happened to oppose there was a 40percent increase in the capital gains tax rate that 40percent increase in the capital gains tax rate created a tremendous disincentive for those who had capital appreciation what happened was we saw a tremendous drop in revenues to the treasury because of that socalled lockin effect which went into play and at that point we lost a tremendous amount of revenue tragically now there are many that say that the loss in revenue to the treasury which has come since 1986 has been because of the economic slowdown which has taken place but you cansee on this chart here that there is a tremendous dropoff which takes place in 1987 when we were still seeing economic growth take place long before the economic recession began this played a role in creating the economic recession that increase in the capital gains tax rate of 40 percent which was incorporated in the 1986 tax reform act actually decreased revenues to the treasury and laid the groundwork for the economic recession which has been so devastating so it seems to me as we look at tax rates especially in the area of capital gains the best thing that we can possibly do is reduce them to stimulate the economy now the joint commission on taxation has come to the conclusion that any capital gains tax rate which is beyond 28 5 percent actually decreases the flow of revenue to the federal treasury as we look at that and this is evidence which has come from a wide range of economists and not just information from economists but empirical evidence which we have gleaned from the activities of investors here in the united states what we found is that we are going to decrease revenue to the treasury if there is any kind of increase in the capital gains tax rates and what we need to do to increase revenue to the treasury is actually see a meaningful cut in the capital gains tax rate this is a bipartisan issue as i said president clinton talked about it in his campaign last fall i wish he had taken that capital gains rate reduction plan that he talked about as a candidate and put it into place as part of his budget package unfortunately he did not and it is not the only promise that he has turned his back on and many of us have recognized that on both sides of the aisle when i say the capital gains tax reduction is not simply a partisan issue it is not just the fact that president clinton talked about it as a candidate we saw here in the house a vote on the capital gains issue two years ago and that vote saw 43 democrats join with us to pass the package tragically the capital gains tax reduction designed to stimulate economic growth died in the senate because of the filibuster that was brought about by the senate majority leader"], [0.0036816769279539585, 0.0036816769279539585, 0, "i rise in support of the words of every republican

many things are going up with the clinton budget we are considering today but the worst things about it are what things are going down i want to bring my colleagues attention to both the ups and the downs of the socalled plan needless to say spending is up despite omb director leon panettas comments earlier this year that the administrations budget would contain 2 in spending for every 1 in new taxes this reconciliation bill reverses this plan it actually contains 6 in taxes and fees for every 1 in spending reductions and it is a 20toi ratio over the first 2 years call me a cynic but that is more in line with what some of us expected indeed whether spending reductions will ever occur is open to question but one thing is clear the president and the majority democrats in congress are interested only in paying lip service to spending cuts in its exhaustive search for domestic programs that dont work and are no longer needed the administration came up with only 11 programs totaling less than 3 billion out of the 1 427 trillion in nondefense outlays in 1997 and of the 343 billion this bill contains in reconciled reductions less than 70 billion is not arrived at by higher taxes overall this budget adds nearly 38 billion in new or expanded entitlement programs which have after all been the problem with this budget all along while the administration has been forced into negotiating with congress over entitlement caps little has been said about the entitlement programs the budget creates even though halt a dozen human resources provisions were cut by 1 2 billion over 5 years incredibly 20 other programs were expanded by 1 9 billion creating a spending increase of 700 million so what did the ways and means committee do characteristically it added new taxes including extending the federal unemployment tax which now enjoys permanent status as a temporary tax only in washington the new immunization program is a good example of how the democrats pass up opportunities to reform social services and simply resort to throwing dollars at problems despite evidence that govemmentprovided immunizations will have no impact on the immunization rate the democrats passed on a republican plan to allow states to use rewards and punishments to encourage welfare recipients to immunize their children thereby adding another 2 billion to cost of this bill there is not even a pretense that the regressive energy tax portion of this tax bill will not be used for more spending the white house has stated that the energy tax will help reduce the deficit and put the government on a payasyougo basis for needed public programs thats more spending folks and itis interesting to see how the democrats have tried to hide the taxs regressivity by robbing one class of taxpayers to pay off another this budget spends at least onehalf of the 71 5 billion expected to be raised over 5 years on lowincome families and individuals including printed on recycled paper containing 100 post consumer waste h 2998 c a 28 billion increase in the earned income tax credit eitc 7 billion in additional food stamp payments and 1 billion for lowincome home energy assistance program payments this forces middleincome familieshardly our nations richest taxpayersto pay an excessive share of the administrations revenue goal and as the energy tax increases yearly it is impossible for the middle class to know the size of the bag it is left holding it truly is a stealth tax which brings me to the next item that is up with the clinton budgettaxes all of this increased spending will require passage of the most massive tax hike in history it calls for 332 billion in tax increases over next 5 years and adding the various hidden increases the tax bite will grow even larger in later years it creates a new individual income tax rate brackets at the 36 and 39 6 percent levels which reach even lower down the income scale than now these new tax rates are supposed to raise 31 billion of the 39 billion in deficit reduction for 1994 under this plan gone at least from this reconciliation bill is all pretense of a millionaire surtax the white house no longer pretends that it is anything more than another rate bracket with millionaires defined now as those earning more than 250 000 and of course this tax is retroactive to the beginning of 1993 even families with incomes under 20 000 contrary to the presidents claims will bear the burden every time they pay their heating bills fill their gas tanks of make a purchase of almost any kind the clinton energy tax alone will cost every american family 471 a year individuals with adjusted gross incomes over 150 000 who pay estimated taxes must under the clinton budget pay 110 percent of current year taxes as next years estimated taxes to qualify for a safe harbor so individuals with no increase in income or tax liability during that year are effectually giving the government an interestfree loan this is outrageous but it is even worse for corporations even though this bill sets the maximum corporate tax rate at 35 percent large corporations which pay estimated taxes must pay a full 100 percent estimation rather than the 97 percent under current law this reduces the margin of error in computing estimated taxes and virtually assures the assessment of penalties the administration hopes to gain 2 7 billion from this unfair illusory deficit reduction provision which will only speed up the payment of corporate taxes by a few months and make a cheap profit from hardtofollow rules which are broken there is a hidden rate bracket increase in this reconciliation bill on small businesses and family farms the biggest job creators throughout the 1980s the bill would phaseout the permanent personal exemption limiting itemized deductions and removing the cap on wages subject to the health insurance tax there is also a new maximum marginal tax rate of nearly 44 percent as my colleagues know the maximum marginal tax rate currently almost 32 percentrepresents the true incentive for entrepreneurs to earn extra money so once a person pays the highest stated tax rate of 39 6 percent adds in a medicare tax for selfemployed individuals of 2 9 percent and tacks on an itemized deduction limit at about 1 2 percent tell me what is the incentive for him or her to engage in the type of economic activity our economy needs this"], [0.0037189351860433817, 0.0037189351860433817, 0, "as chairman of the republican research task force on competitiveness i am pleased to run the opening lap of the third annual riepublican regulatory relay our country is faced with a huge and growing bureaucracy of overzealous regulators who ignore costbenefit analysis and whose primary concern is validating their own existence since 1992 members of congress have run laps on the house floor t ilng attention to the multitude of unnecessary and illconceved regulations that are forced down the throats of american businesses and american consurers last year president clinton and vice president aj goa brought stacks of regulations out on the white house lawn to promote their reinventing gavermnment effort which was intended to reduce the regulatory maze within the f ederal government t would much rather fight to ease the regulatory burden faced by small businesses all across america which are the jobcreating engin6s of our economny rather than to make federal pencilpushers jobs easier at its best the process makes no sense and at its worst regulators classify their childrens teeth as toxic waste they force banks to make teller machines accessible to blind drivers they dictate that hard hats must be disinfected before each use and they require employers to inform employees about the hazards of coming in contact with joy dishwashing liquid since reaching a low point in i96 the cost of regulatory compliance the number of rules reviewed by the white houses office of information and regalatory affairs the number of federal register pages and employment at federal regulatory agencies all have beer steadily increasing in fact president clintons first year saw the most regu latory activity since president carters lastl the page total for 199a of the fed eral register was 69 f68 pages the third highest total of a l time a not surpris ing increase in the number of regulatory bureaucrat corresponds with this proliferation of regulatfon while from 1988 to 1992 regulatory staffing increased by over 20 percent to almost 125 000 employees under president clinton the largest number of federal bureaucrats ever 128 615 people were called for to run his federal regulatory apparatus the direct costs of federal regulations are estimated to be about 500 billion a year now if you take into account the indirect costs and include state and local regulation the regulatory burden is anywhere from 810 billion to 1 7 trillion dollars per year that is a staggering 8 400 to 17 000 per household per year as you can see the costs of federal regulation are only going to continue to escalate throughout this decade a typical american business must fulfill provisions of the clean air and clean water acts provide a minimum standard of living for workers engage in recycling carry an expensive insurance policy against product liability ferret out illegal aliens provide costly packages of medical benefits to employees which may have to include acupuncture wigs pastoral services and drug treatment they have to provide special accommodations to disabled employees and promote equal opportunity as determined by race sex and sexual activity listed here in the record there will be 100 forms and booklets of information that a typical business has to sort through and fill out to comply with federal rules and regulations this list does not even include many of the regulations contained in the clean air act amendments of 1990 or the recently passed family and medical leave act the small business administration estimated that small business owners spend almost a billion hours a year just filling out government forms at an annual cost of 100 million dollars imagine what a boost that kind of money would be to the economy let me just outline some of the kinds of horror stories that are happening all over this country the department of transportation repeatedly considered promulgating new hazardous material regulations for the shipping of butter and salad oil the plan which has apparently been dropped but picked up again by the department of commerce and other departments would have required 24 hours 24 hours of classroom and field training for workers who responded to spill emergencies of butter and salad oil john shuler a montana rancher was repeatedly fined 4 000 for violating the endangered species act what was mr shulers crime he shot and killed a grizzly bear that had charged after him on his own property o c mills and his son carey run a small contracting business in florida recently they were both thrown into prison for putting 19 loads of sand on two waterfront properties they wished to develop despite initial approval of their development project by floridas environmental regulators then headed by the current epa administrator administrator carol browner the millses were convicted of wetlands violations shortly after the project began john mccurdy who is an owner of a very small herring smoke house recently had a runin with the fda despite producing over 54 million filets over 20 years without one single reported case of food poisoning the fda told mccurdy he would have to change his methods unfortunately that would have required 75 000 worth of new equipment facing the hopeless choice between installing equipment he could not afford or fighting a legal battle with the fda mr mccurdy chose the only other alternative he closed his business and laid off his 22 employees carol roberts is a selfemployed knitter who does all her work at home she produces sweaters hats and mittens and sells them to retailers for a small profit that helps support her family but all this could change if the aflcio and the labor department get their way union officials are now pushing to reinstate a ban on athome garment work that was removed in the 1980s if the law goes back into effect home garment workers like carol roberts would be considered criminals in the eyes of the law robert m cox was the former vice president of the gilbert spruance co a small paint company from pennsylvania in 1984 a nightmare began for his company when they were notified that a former waste hauler for mr coxs company had apparently dumped waste illegally in new jersey despite the fact that mr coxs company had no knowledge of or connection to the waste haulers illegal activity the gilbert spruance co was asked to foot a substantial part of the cleanup costs ranging from 175 000 to 1 3 million dollars years of legal wrangling and work with government agencies administrators and legislators mr coxs company finally had to declare bankruptcy and sell all of their assets as mr cox a selfdescribed environmentalist asked why doesnt the system allow an environmentally sensitive paint company to coexist with superfund why does our system create so much inertia that the lawyers and administrators get rich off a manufacturing company that has been trying to do the correct thing all along i could go on and on and on i have pages after pages after pages of horror stories like these that we find happening in our government all the time this month the regulatory relay is focusing on the dry cleaning industry whose experience with government regulations is indicative of the larger trend of increased difficulty in starting up and maintaining a very small business their plight is eloquently described in a paper called taken to the clearners a case study of the overregulation of american small business that was recently published by the cato institute and written by jonathan adler a policy analyst at the competitive enterprise institute the paper points out that according to the international fabric care institute the typical dry cleaning outlet is a very small familyowned business that employees an average of 5 people and grosses an average of 200 000 per year the estimated profit per firm is only 10 000 annually clearly a very limited amount with which to absorb additional regulatory costs in 1990 the average profit for a dry cleaner was 0 43 percent because of their small size dry cleaners are extremely vulnerable to the costs of regulation even those seemingly benign requirements such as filing a hazardous waste report this rule can require as many as 60 hours to fulfill a significant burden on a dry cleaning business whose employees put in no more than 200 manhours per week and that is just one regulation operators of small businesses face regulatory hurdles at every turn the cato paper states that for dry cleaners that means clean air regulations governing perchloroethylene emissions and hazardous waste regulations governing the disposal of chemicals occupational safety regulations cover exposure to cleaning solvents and require demanding precautions in the handling of garments worn in hospitals and dental offices governments at all levels have imposed exacting liability standards that threaten the existence of many dry cleaning establishments additionally dry cleaners are subject to the labor codes wage laws and tax rules that affect all small businesses nationwide while many regulations are wellintended the lack of reliable cost benefit analysis means that their implementation often results in ridiculous situations for example in southern california a dry cleaner was fined 250 for failing to post a listing of employee injuries that had occurred during the last 12 months the problem is the dry cleaner had no employee injuries to report in effect the business was fined for failing to post a blank piece of paper because of regulations covering the disposal of socalled hazardous wastes the costs of disposing spent cartridge filters and other process waste have skyrocketed a new filter cartridge can be purchased in san antonio tx for 18 75 but its disposal costs 21 in virginia a dry cleaner is required to submit monthly retail sales tax forms to the state even though the store sells no taxable items failure to file the tax forms would result in fines even though not filing would save time and money for both the business and the government other times regulators cause serious damage in their enforcement of regulations at a press conference we held yesterday kicking off the relay bill grigg vice president and manager of wayside clean rs in portsmouth va spoke of thp ordeal he had to go through after the virginia department of labor and industry showed up unannounce for an occupational safety and health

potentially liable for 30 00 in fines four months later and after pleabargaining mr griggs receted a apage dli citation and a reduced fine of 13 2006 among his serinus violations snokng was permitted in flammable or combustible liquid storage areas in point of fact smoking was not allowed in the work area but was allowed in a bathroom located behfnf the dry cleaning area the bathroom was fully enclosed and separated from the work area by a cement wall and a fully closing door wayside failed to provide an eucational program complete with documentation of annual training for all employees on the operation of portable fire extinguishers to be used in case of an emergency employers are required to have such programs for emergency equipment and workplace hazards such as cleaning solvents and provide documentation that all workers partici pated one of waysides approximately 100 electrical outlets wan found to haxve reversed polarity it is amazing to me that this situation exists for the dry cleaning industrythe epa classifies perc as a hazardous waste when discarded or otherwise disposed of in addition existing epa regulations classify any wastes that are mixed with or derived from perc as hazardous under that definition used perc and filter cartridge that contain minute amounts of perm are classified as hazardous wastes by the epas own admfssion a regulated hazardous waste handler must do hundreds of things correctly to fully comply with the regulations yet doingonly one thing wrong makes the handler aviolator in the case of the typical dry cleaner that means storing hazardous wastes in properly marked containers and keeping detailed records of the use transportation and disposal of the wastes because of the complexity of the hazardous waste regulationsthe epa has acknowledged that the definitionbs of solid waste and hazardous waste are exceedingly difficult to understand eveni for the most experienced staff most dry cleaners contract with certifiec hazardou waste disposal firms to ensure regulatory compliance safetykleen provide those services for most dry cleaners because safetykleen is also required to comply with the regulations governing the handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste the costs of disposal arm tiflated dry cleaners will thus spend as much as 2 000 or more ditposing of cartridges and other hazardous ma teriais the regulations have inflated the costs of disposal so much that fi some parts of the country it costs more to dispose ofa filter cartridge than it does to purchase one new the paperwork burden imposed bythe hazardous waste regulations is substantial numerous forms and permit applications are typically required for proper perc handling and disposal among those is the epas fivevolume national survey of hazardous waste generators the first volume of which contains over 80 pages of instructionson how to flr out the remaining voiumes they even sent instructions on how to read the instructions according to gerald levine associate director of the neighborhood cleaners association such monstrous documents could intimidate any small business owner let alone a recent immigrant whomight not have complete control of the language the epas 1991 hazardous waste report required an estimated average of 19 hoursnearly half of a work weekto complete according to the epa dry cleaners interviewed for this study suggested that the actual time required is significantly greater the epas hazardou waste report is in additfom to whatever state requirements are in place in some states it may cost over 800 simply to obtain hazardous waste permits from local agencies the hazardou waste regulations are yet another layer in the government burdens threatening tosmother small business in america let me

report i have two main concerns one a longstanding opposition to the unnecessary level of secrecy in which the intelligence budget is cloaked and two the abrupt change in direction that the intelligence conferees have taken in their report regarding two important intelligence programs first i will state to my colleagues once again my belief that the foreign policy activities of this nation taken by our government on behalf of its citizens should and is for the most part done in the open i believe it is wrong however that an arm of our government is given the authority to conduct operations other than intelligence gathering in support of foreign policy goals that are unknown to our citizens the people of the united states have a right to be engaged in the debate which yields our foreign policy activities i do not here refer to the important maintenance of operational secrecy but rather to the need to debate in the open whether and when we would engage in hostile operations against another country in this context my concern lies not specifically the overall budget level for intelligence although i believe that prudent savings in the intelligence budget can be realized with careful planning and a recognition of the many new and open ways in which information flows to policymakers additionally it is the right of the people of our country to know the funding level of its intelligence agencies i will continue to support legislative efforts that would bring these aspects into the sunshine my second objection to the report is concemed more with what has become ablurred relationship between the national foreign intelligence or nfip programs and tactical intelligence and related activities or tiara programs i think it is time we substantially change this arrangement i am disappointed and concerned that the conferees have increased the authorization for nfip above the budget request while authorizing a corresponding decrease in tiara programs this action is contrary to actions taken by the conferees on the fiscal year 1995 defense authorization and appropriations acts and contrary to agreements reached between the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence resulting from their joint review of nfip and tiara programs we should be focusing on the interoperability of capabilities in support of military operations ensuring essential improvements for imagery support as well as developing a new unitedstates intelligence program and budget structure to better reflect user needs and priorities consistent with our changed strategic environment the blurring of national versus tactical intelligence was highlighted last year when the committee raised concern in its report on the fiscal year 1994 defense authorization bill the committee then observed that over the years the boundaries between tiara and nfip components of the intelligence budgets have become a source of confusion and contention the committee was and continues to be concerned that the lack of clearly established definitions for nfip and tiara have led to the sometimes arbitrary assignment of intelligence programs and functions within these categories as a consequence the armed services committee called on the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence to review intelligence programs and activities and provide to congress a report identifying those programs which support first primarily national purposes second primarily defensewide theater activities and the unified command or three primarily a single service or agency the report was also to have identified those programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget although we have seen fragments and or bits and pieces of what appears to be a concerted effort to address this matter a formal comprehensive report has yet to be provided an important review was undertaken by the department earlier this year to determine what if any programs or activities should be removed from tiara this effort was undertaken in response to the fiscal year 1994 house armed services committee language asking the department to identify programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget as a result the department determined that indeed there were certain programs that fell outside the definition of tiara used by the congress and has subsequently proposed to delete these activities from the fiscal year 1996 tiara congressional justification book these programs include for example ballistic missile defense the defense meteorological support program tanker support to reconnaissance and the navys mapping charting and geodesy to name a few when added up funding for these programs totaled more than a half a billion dollars in each of fiscal year 1994 and further earlier this year nowdeputy secretary of defense john deutch notified officials within the department of defense and congress

monstrous monumental micromanagement would have to take place in order carry out the doolittle amendment the doolittle amendment invades the prerogatives of the local school boards as very few other amendments have done throughout all of our debate on goals 2000 where the federal government seeks to set certain standards in content and curricula and standards in performance everything has been voluntary everything has been in terms of we will state certain models and the states in the final analysis will decide what they want to do local control in curriculum has not been violated in any of the legislation for education that we have pursued so far if there are people who really want to have the federal government have a greater role in promoting values and preventing teenage pregnancies and providing more positive sex education then there are many things the federal government can do madam chairman let us be brave enough to take on the media be brave enough to use the power of the federal government through the federal communications commission the no i problem in america with respect to the values of young people is the influence of the media television radio and motion pictures the federal government has direct control over the airwaves either through the fcc broadcast regulations or through the fcc regulation of cable i say to my colleagues if you are interested in having this body do what this body can do best and what local school boards cannot djo then try to promote more stringent requirements on the manner in which sex and the wanton participation in sex is encouraged via our media via the radio television and motion picture formats we have the power to regulate interstate commerce the movement of pornographic magazines there are a number of things we can do corporations are responsible for most of the progranming that appears on broadcast television and much of the programming that appears on cable television we have power with respect to the regulation of corporate activity we have power with respect to regulation of how they spend their advertising dollars if you want to be brave and do something about trying to influence teenage values then why not take on a greater regulation role with respect to the fcc with respect to corporate power and the kinds of things they finance why not take on a greater regulation role with respect to the motion picture industry the magazine industry there are a number of ways in which you can deal with and deal more effectively with your agenda to better promote more positive attitudes among teenagers with respect to sex educatiom we have no business in interfering and we hope that they will take the necessary steps to provide enough sex education to guarantee that the youngsters know how to protect their own health to guarantee they know how to survive madam chairman aids is a very deadly disease schools must not ignore teaching about aids in a way which helps teenagers to survive

no school board in america where abstinence is not already a major part of this concern everybody does it we do not need to have regulations handed down by the federal government to do what has been embedded in our tradition and our culture all the religions as some have pointed out all the religions promote abstinence i say to my colleagues if you want to do something about the degrading

obtaining legal assistance in our society is often beyond the means of many of our constituents reducing the cost of litigation should be a priority of all of us the supreme court as part of its responsibility for constructive change under the rules enabling act trans mitted certain amendments to the federal rules of civil procedure to the congress on april 22 1993 under the mechanism established by the congress in the rules enabling act these proposed amendments will become law on december 1 1993 unless the congress acts to change them initially i would like to applaud this monumental effort and compliment those in the judiciary the academic community and the bar who participated in the long and arduous process which preceded the supreme courts action i do notand let me emphasize thisi do not want to in any way limit future innovation by the judicial conference by what we may do here today instead congress by proposing minimal modifications to these proposed rules changes will be following our recent precedent of only occasionally interjecting ourselves in the rulemaking process and then in a limited fashion however after reviewing the extensive record of these proposed rules and our hearing on june 16 1993 i believe we should make some changes to proposed rule xxvi a 1 dealing with the disclosure process and to that part of rule xxx which provides the means of taking depositions these changes are incorporated in h r 2814 rule xxvi axl rule xxvi governs most of the federal discovery process and the present system has been the target of widespread criticism i agree with much of this criticism the unitedstates judicial conference in an attempt to streamline the discovery process has proposed new rule xxvi a 1 which calls for mandatory disclosure of matters pleaded with particularity champions of the proposed rule believe that it will avoid the unnecessary expenses that are the hallmark of the discovery process as it stands today opponents however including the vast majority of those who have commented on this section feel that mandatory disclosure is anathema to the adversarial process and will compromise the attorneyclient privilege they also feel that the standard that is pleaded with particularity is too vague and will only increase the discovery burdens of the system instead of reducing them they feel that a change of this nature should be taken with extreme caution i and the committee on the judiciary believe these objections have merit we also believe that during the period of local experimentation mandated under the civil justice reform act of 1990 it would be premature to change the federal rules of civil procedure to establish any particular procedure for mandatory early disclosure whether such procedures should be implemented on a local basis should be left to each district court h r 2814 deletes most of rule xxvi a 1 and we will look to the future for more empirical data on these procedures as provided for in the civil justice reform act of 1990 rule xxx since 1970 rule xxx has permitted depositions to be recorded by nonstenographic means but only upon court order or with the written stipulation of the parties the proposed changes in rule xxx b would alter that procedure by eliminating the requirement of a court order or stipulation and affording each party the right to arrange for recording of a deposition by nonstenographic means testimony at our hearing raised concerns about the reliability and durability of video or audio tape alternatives to stenographic depositions there also was information submitted suggesting that technological improvements in stenographic recording should make the stenographic method more costeffective for years to come depositions recorded stenographically historically have provided an accurate record of testimony which can conveniently be used by both trial and appellate courts in addition the certification of accuracy by an independent and unbiased third party is an important component of the present policy on depositions the case has not been made yet for unilateral decisions on the use of nonstenographic recording of depositions h r 2814 retains the rule that nonstenographic recording of depositions is authorized only when permitted by court order or stipulation of the parties in this limited fashion h r 2814 will make these appropriate changes to the proposed rules changes i also would like to speak briefly on chairman brooks concerns on the proposed limitations on interrogatories and depositions initially i will admit that i also questioned whether the presumptive limits on the number of depositions and interrogatories contained in proposed rule xxx a 2 a and xxxi a 2 a 10 depositions and xxxiii a 25 interrogatories would be appropriate if we deleted rule xxvi a 1 after studying this matter closely however and discussing it with representatives of the unitedstates judicial conference i believe these are appropriate changes when read in context with the provisions allowing for local rules changes under rule xxvi b 2 and rule xxvi f which requires an early meeting of the parties on discovery issues there is no question in my mind that the discovery process is being abused in some cases and i believe that the parties agreement under xxvi f and the courts early involvement in the process under rule xvi is crucial to cost savings and good court management the basic objective of this rules change is to emphasize that all counsel have a professional obligation to develop a mutual costeffective plan for discovery in such cases consideration of all these factors should be given early at the planning meeting of the parties under rule xxvi f and at the time of a scheduling conference under rule 16 b i would also state that experience in over half of the district courts has indicated that limitations on the number of interrogatories are useful and manageable a study by the federal judicial center of those courts indicates that 73 percent of the attorneys who responded to a poll in these districts state that limiting interrogatories exerts worthwhile control on discovery i would also say that there are similar limitations in many state court systems for example in the state courts of texas in my contacts with the unitedstates judicial conference they state that first in the majority of cases the presumptive limits are not exceeded and second in other cases the amendments will require an attorney to stop and think whether additional interrogatories or depositions are really necessary at that time the attorney is required to articulate the reason to a judge unless the parties stipulate i would also say that the department of justice favors the presumptive limits on discovery proposed in these rules i believe these presumptive limits will in most cases not be a hindrance and in the complicated cases these limits will bring the parties together in order to make a constructive early disposition of the discovery process i urge my colleagues to support h r e3 1650"], [0.98783253505826, 0.012167464941740036, 1, "in the context of the
