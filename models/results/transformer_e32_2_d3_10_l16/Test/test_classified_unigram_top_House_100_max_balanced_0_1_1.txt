thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would

of commerce certainly his life and the contributions he made to our national government in these several years are important indeed and his memory is certainly appropriate for what we try to do in this bill the purpose of the bill is to encourage american businesses to improve the quality of their goods and services we all know that in the future economic world we will find ourselves in that quality is what counts and that it is going to take improvements in quality to market our production both here and abroad as secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige was in the forefront of the fight to regain americas preeminence as the world leader in trade and commerce certainly it is fitting that this national award for excellence be established in his name if the gentleman will continue to yield

improve the quality of their goods and services and noted that it does so withoutthrowing a lot of dollars around indiscriminately at programs of unproven worth secretary baldrige said we have to encourage american executives to get out of their boardrooms and onto the factory floor to learn how their products are made and how they can be made better certainly we know that in the pursuit of this award process that is exactly what those executives will have to do and certainly their production processes will be the beneficiaries i also would like to mention in passing that this is an area that has been governed by the unbrella act of stevensonwydler named for jack wydler who served on our committee on science space and technology for a number of years before he retired several years ago and of course congressman wydler died several days ago so it is certainly appropriate that we remember his lasting imprint in this area this act by amending stevensonwydler would pay tribute to

famine camps throughout ethiopia we are now hearing reports that famine will be coming again to ethiopia the rains stopped suddenly this past june and julyand as many as 5 million ethiopians will be threatened by famine by the end of this year i want to commend the unitedstates agency for international development for responding so quickly to this news aid has already announced that 115 000 metric tons of emergency food commodities have been approved for shipment to ethiopia i applaud these actions its critical that needed foods reach ethiopias rural highlands before the famine starts but i also want to highlight an important underlying economic problem ethiopia has consistently refused to institute badly needed agricultural reforms now although other african countries affected by this latest drought have food stocks from the past 2 good years to rely upon ethiopia has almost no food stocks we need to understand that a permanent end to hunger in ethiopia will never occur on the basis of generous american humanitarian relief alone humanitarian relief is critical but we also need to draw the worlds attention to why the ethiopian situation is so chronically desperate id like to

have this special order and permit those of us who had the pleasure and great pleasure of serving with john grotberg an opportunity to speak to the record for the future as well as to extend our deepest sympathies and affection for jean and for the entire grotberg family i miss john very much and as a democrat who sat on the other side of the aisle from him in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs i still find myself looking down to where his chair was we had the opportunity to work together on several bills and i came so much to appreciate his quick wit and wry humor i think even in his brief time here i could see the imprint of his experience in the illinois legislature when you saw him function as an effective member of our committee we were abletogether and just for the record i wanted to say that the last bill that he had a hand in here was public law 99202 december 23 1985 the save for the usa year which had to do with savings bonds and increasing the sale of our public debt securities to unitedstates citizens he and i worked on that together for a very long period of time and it is really the bill that permitted me to get to know him better as a person i thought for the record it might be interesting just to tell the story of this bill and how very much it meant to him we had to get signatures we had to get 218 signatures and he knew i was interested in savings bonds and he was as well so we decided to hitch up as a team within about 2 days john had over 70 signatures i said gosh john i said i cant keep up with you i said how in the world do you do it he said i know how to work a cloakroom we within just a few days had the required number of signatures and in that particular session of congress we had the only bill that managed to make it through that committee get passed on the floor of this house as well as over on the senate side and be signed into law by the president of the united states when we were getting our signatures on this side i said gosh john i said weve got a problem over in the other body theyre not moving very quickly he goes no problem follow me so we went out this middle door we walked across the rotunda we went over to the senate side and we went into the cloakroom over there and of course i was a little cautious i wanted the officer to clear me to go into the cloakroom and john said just walk right in we walked in and he said to the person at the desk wheres dole well it turned out that the majority leader at that time was in an airplane somewhere over the united states and john made sure that we made a telephone call right there and within 10 minutes senator dole was back to us in the cloakroom and john said when can you schedule it on the floor the senator informed us we should go see the speaker pro tem strom thurmond and we got off the telephone at that time senator dole had two huge boxes of chocolate candy over in the senate john and i both managed to grab a couple handfuls of that candy on the way out the door and we proceeded to find the speaker pro tems office without any knocking or anything john walked right in to the office and he said to the young woman sitting at the desk wed like to speak to the speaker pro tem who was standing back in the corner completely startled that these two members from the other side would have walked in unannounced like that and john walked up to him and said i happen to be a freshman this lady is a sophomore and we dont have anything important to do over there were just lowerranking members so we decided to really get on savings bonds this year and push them and we need your help we need your signature and heres the bill and senator thurmond stood there and kind of looked at this bill and looked at the two of us and it had to be one of the most unusual requests he had ever had and we got his signature within 15 seconds it was in that way then that we got the bill moved over in the senate senator dole scheduled it the next day and it passed the senate on december 16 1985 after having passed the house here on december 12 1985 it was then signed by the president i said to john before we left washington you know john this is such a big thing weve got to promote savings bonds in america when can we go over to the white house we have to get the president involved in this the first lady involved in this he said well why dont we do it in january i said ok john when he said well you take care of it im going on vacation i said oh john you have to be back here for that you cant miss an event like that that was the last time that i really had an opportunity to speak with him i never knew he was ill and he was going into the hospital that christmas and when i got back here in january to try to recoup and to put our agenda together to go over to the white house i found that he was in intensive care never to come out again last year i had to go before the national committee the private sector group that promotes savings bonds sales in the united states and to accept a liberty bell on behalf of both john and myself for our efforts in promoting this particular legislation which resulted last year in the largest number of savings bonds sales in the united states in several decades i will tell you it was a very emotional moment for me because i felt that i wanted to say so many things for john he was alive at that point and i wanted him to be there with me and he was not able to be there so i think this bill and the savings bonds sales in 1986 are a true tribute to him it has been an honor to have served with john grotberg he put a human face on this house and i pray for him and for his family"], [0.9888910222798586, 0.01110897772014141, 1, "the gentlemans point is partially well taken but i would like to

with an inadequate amount of money we will be looking at this problem in another 18 or 24 months some say what is wrong with just looking at it in 18 or 24 months the problem is that the congress in
