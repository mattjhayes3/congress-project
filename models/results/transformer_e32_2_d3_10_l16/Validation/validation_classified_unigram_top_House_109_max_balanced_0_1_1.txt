friends from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the treasury backs this up 1 01 trillion borrowed in 224 years since 1776 to the year 2000 versus 1 05 trillion that was borrowed from 2001 to 2005 and counting from the president and the republican majority congress we are saying that we want to pay as we go we are saying that we want to make sure that we are fiscally responsible and we are saying that we are not going to allow the republican majority to be able to have these countries look at america in a different way than they were prior to this administration and prior to this republican congress i yield to the gentlewoman from florida

democratic whip mr steny hoyer and also our chairman mr james clyburn and i think it is also mr larson who is our vice chpir and the rest of the ranking members and other members of the democratic caucus an hour ago we were talking about the issues of fiscal responsibility we were talking about trying to make sure that the american taxpayer gets what tfiey deserve out of this government this government that they have elected to cometo washington d c to represent them to make sure that they get the biggest bang for their tax dollar i think it is important to point out that we are having some real financial issues right now some may say on the majority side ahid i do respect the members on the majority side and i know that there are a few members on the majority side that feel the way we feel here on the minority side on the democratic side of the aisle that we have to get our fiscal house in order and we are not there yet i can say here boldly and honestly that we are not there there are a number of thirdparty validators that are talking about the fiscal irresponsibility on the majority side and by this president that has put this country in financial jeopardy you have individuals saying we want to cut the deficit in half but meanwhile back at the ranch they want to borrow from countries like china they want to borrow from countries like saudi arabia and give those countries a piece of the american pie i think it is important that in the last hour when we talked about innovation we talked about putting america first we talked about not cutting student loans to everyday americans we talked about assisting that next generation and the generations that we expect to be able to stand up and make this and continue to make this country free and put us ahead as it relates to inventions as it relates to innovation we are talking about on this side of the aisle that we embrace and we appreciate our troops and our veterans but meanwhile in the presidents budget it talks about cuts in veterans affairs it talks about higher copayments for veterans i must say i am a democrat but guess what i represent republicans indepenlents green party and democrats back in my district and they feel the way that i do r have not had one constituent say congressman i want you to go to washington d c and make sure that you borpow as much money as possible so that i can pay it back with interest congressman i want you to go to washington d c and be irresponsible with my tax dollars and make sure that we do not have accountability as it relates to unbid contracts congressman i want you to look the other way when it comes down to making surethat you have the proper oversight so that we do not have this culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence that we are seeing on the majority side and in the white house right now i think it is very very important the perception that the american people and the reality that they are seeing right now this is not the kendrick meek or the 30something or the tim ryan report this is what is being printed every day in the papers it is not that the congress is taking a bold step to make sure that the children of america have what they need making sure that we have the kinds of innovation that the president spoke about making sure that the veterans do not have to pay a higher copayment for health insurance that we promised them as a country we salute one flag right now not because of coincidence because individuals have died for that opportunity we have individuals that have served and served in many theaters to make sure that we can salute one flag and the bottom line is we should not turn our backs on those individuals what mr ryan and i are going to talk about in this 30something hour is the tax on corruption the corruption tax that the american people have to pay and the american children have to pay and men and women that have worn a uniform have to pay guess what it is not just democrats it is not just republicans it is not just independents it is the american people it is not just the folks that vote it is not just the folks that do not vote it is not the folks who are seeking status that have green cards in this country that are legally here it is happening right now mr speaker and mr ryan i just want to say before i yield i feel good about the fact that we were talking about the k street project 2 years ago night after night week after week we talked about it we were honest and upfront with the american people that something was fundamentally wrong when you have a k street project talk about it put a press release out about it about how we have this relationship with the special interests what about a relationship with the american people mr speaker so now we have a lobbyist here in this town that has admitted to guilt mr ryan that has said i have broken the law we do nothave to have a trial because the evidence is so strong we do not have to have a jury pool we do not have to have pedple come in and waste 6 months of their lives on a jury pool and a jury selection i will admit to guilt days after this particular lobbyist said i am guilty i am willing to help the government in seeking out those members that were part of this"], [0.002778291702270508, 0.9972217082977295, 1, "mr ryan i dont give the president total credit for all of this he couldnt do it by himself you have to have a rubber stamp congress to give you full power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the facts are i yield to ms wasserman schultz"], [0.002845287322998047, 0.997154712677002, 1, "thank you so very much ms wasserman schultz i am glad that you brought a visual aid down because i think it is important that we break this down for the members because we want to make sure that members dont go back home in november and giving political speeches saying that oh well i didnt know we were doing that or i didnt know that we were breaking a record in borrowing from foreign nations we want to make sure that the congressional record reflects that those of us on this side of the aisle actually brought it to the floor in a form that a middle school or a fifth grader can understand and it is important that we break it down to this point so that no one can say that they misunderstood they didnt quite know what they were voting for i made a mistake or whatever the case may be because now in this day in this congress we are making history in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways i think it is important that we point this out i want to make sure that i get that washington post article that talked about a special meeting at the white house the innovation agenda i want to make sure that the members go on housedemocrats gov and get a copy of the innovation agenda so that hopefully folks can be enlightened on what we have been talking about and promoting not just yesterday not just last month this has been around and the only reason why it is not implemented now is that the republican majority will not allow legislation to come to the floor outside of the original thoughts of president bush or the republican leaders i think it is important that we understand an innovation agenda we talk about education and creating the workforce for the future making sure that there is math and science education that we work on that and we provide the necessary dollars for it invest in research and also development that promotes publicprivate partnerships where many ceos you will see on housedemocrats gov have already become a part of what we are talking about and encouraging that to happen affordable guaranteed broadband access throughout the country need it be if you are in the heartland of america you are on the east coast you are on the west coast you are down south you are up north you should be able to have an opportunity at this broadband initiative that we have for all americans achieving energy independence we talked about that withir 10 years not maybe one day not counting on the oil companies to do it but the congress setting the stage this house setting the stage for that to happen providing small businesses with the tools that they need to be able to create jobs i am just going to take about 10 minutes here breaking this thing down if not shorter of talking about how we are making history in all the wrong ways the republican majority i must say has done an outstanding job on behalf of president bush you have got to hand it to them if there was an oscar an emmy or a grammy to give out the republican majority would get it as it relates to rubberstamping everything the administration hands down i hold here and this is no secret to many of the members and it should not be a secret to the staff that works here in the house of representatives this chart this chart of the fact that in just 4 years president bush and the republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign nations we have the republican congress right under the presidents picture because he couldnt do it by himself fortytwo united states presidents 224 years were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion from foreign nations how could that be one may say how can you do this in 4 years 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 224 years 200 years shy of what the president has been able to do 1 01 trillion let me tell you that is staggering that is not something that it happened in the forties or it happened in the thirties once upon a time calculate it fortytwo presidents 224 years we are not just here as the 30 something working group and dreaming up something those numbers are from the unitedstates department of treasury who do we owe who has their hands in the pockets of the american taxpayer i dont care if you are a republican independent you dont vote yet or whatever the case may be a democrat you have to have a problem with these nations owning a piece of the american apple pie japan like it or not i know it is painful for some of the members to hear this but this is the reality under a republican majority japan 682 8 billion that they own of the american apple pie thanks to the republican majority rubberstamping the bush policies china 249 8 billion of the american apple pie that they own right now not because of the american people lack of making the right fiscal decisions but it is because the republican majority has allowed it to happen with the american taxpayer dollar the u k 223 2 billion caribbean nations 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations oh my goodness opec nations we cant do enough for them but they are buying our debt 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion and canada 53 8 billion the reason why you see the american flag in silhouette as it relates to the united states of america excluding alaska and hawaii and puerto rico and other unitedstates territories but just to show this silhouette of the mainland of the united states of amerida the reason why we have that if you want to do away with the debt elect a democratic majority because we have done it the republican majority they are saying well were going to cut it in half it is almost like if there is a cliff and you are in a vehicle and you have to stop the vehicle before it goes pver the cliff we are qaying st op you are saying gp at half speed you go at half speed you are going"], [0.0028725266456604004, 0.9971274733543396, 1, "i thank the gentleman from new york for yielding i congratulate him on his as always excellent leadership on behalf of the middleclass working families in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a new direction we can begin by rejecting this estate tax giveaway to the wealthy and insist on a vote to increase the minimum wage that would be a real values judgment"], [0.0029172301292419434, 0.9970827698707581, 1, "it is an honor to come

because i know that not only the democratic leader but also the entire democratic caucus is looking to hopefully put america in a new direction we want to make sure that we provide the leadership on behalf of all americans as you know i want to start off tonight but as you know we have been sharing it with the members so that hopefully it will have some sort of lift here in the house it has not had thus far but weare willing to provide the leadership even in the minority even though the majority is not willing to pick up the philosophy that we are pushing here on behalf of the american people making sure that we have more affordable health care this is on housedemocrats gov also lower gas prices to achieve energy independence which we have our energy plan on housedemocrats gov and our innovation plan that has been there for some time and filed legislation here in the house that has not been heard we want to talk about homeland security we have a real security plan also on that website that is there for the members they have to have the will and the desire to be able to take up these plans and these initiatives and if we were able to work in a bipartisan way these plans would already be passed not only in the appropriations act but also here on the floor the two other things that i want to mention as it relates to cutting the cost of college cost as you know the cost to go to college has gone up this republicanled congress last not helped in that area they have not helped the everyday average american to be able to meet the increases that they have been asked to pay and also in a new direction for america is making sure that we follow through with fiscal responsibility pay as we go not just on a credit card not just saying because we can give tax cuts to millionaires and we will just puv it off on future generations or we will go to foreign nations and borrow a record number of dollars these nations that i am holding up here they own a part of the american apple pie not because of what the american people have done it is what the republican congress has done and allow these countries to buy our debt because we are not fiscally responsible i think it is also important to make sure that we encourage working families people that are making minimum wage i just want to make this point then i am going to give it to my friend mr ryan from youngstown ohio as you know we have had time after time again three or four occasions in the 109th congress that we have asked the republican majority to join us in raising the minimum wage to make sure that the american workers are able to keep up with the costs of not only living but inflation but it has been well said and mr ryan will point it out with his chart that he has there in a moment that the republican congress is in no way and in no shape ready to give minimum wage workers an increase since 1997 they have not had an increase but here in the 30something working group we actuallytake time to find out the facts because we want to make sure that we are not telling the american people nor members of this house something that is inaccurate i must say that in 1998 members of congress received 3 100 in a pay increase and we are not minimumwage workers in 1998 minimum wage workers zero mr ryan in 2000 members of congress received a pay increase of 4 600 guess what same year minimumwage workers zero 2001 members of congress received 3 800 minimumwage workers zero in 2002 members of congress received another pay increase 4 900 almost 5 000 pay increase remember we just got one in 2002 i was not a member yet but it happened minimumwage workers zero 2003 members of congress 4 700 pay increase just got one last year getting another one in 2003 of course minimumwage workers zero punch in and punch out every day they work a 40hour work week catch the early bus trying to raise their children members of congress 2004 3 400 pay increase same year minimumwage workers zero mr ryan thanks to the republican majority 2005 it is great to be in congress too bad every american cannot be and minimumwage workers cannot be 2005 members of congress 4 000 tell you the republican majority takes care of their own and us too 2005 zero for minimumwage workers proposed increase for members of congress 3 100 and of course this year again 2006 zero for

you know the 30something working group we come to the floor daily to share not only with the members of the house but also the american people about plans we have that is in holding or in waiting not because of the fact that we are not willing to move forth on behalf of the american people it is because the republican majority has decided not to govern on the side of the american people i feel that this is very very hard core for everyday americans because they are in waiting not only inthe area of minimum wage but also affordable fuel prices and real solutions as relates to protecting our country and also making sure that our veterans who have allowed us to serve who have allowed us to salute one flag will be honored in the area of health care and other areas that we have promised them

to get a pay increase something that members of congress have enjoyed overa number of years but everyday working americans are not able to receive more minimum wage than what they are receiving right now they are right now making 5 and some change and i mean it is unconscionable for members of the house to be able to walk away with an increase costofliving increase meanwhile those individuals that are punching in and punching out every day are still making the same rate that they were making in 1997 it would be an uproar here in this house if members of congress had not received a pay raise since 1997 one thing that i can say here on this side of the aisle the democratic leadership and the democratic caucus has said we will not stand for an increase for members of congress to make more money if we are not going to raise the level of minimum wage for everyday americans and so again we come with thirdparty validators we come with the facts to share with the american people and we come to let the american people know and members on the majority side that we have the will and the desire to lead and we will if we have the opportunity after november i just wanted to share a few things because there are a lot of folks that are out there saying that they are fighting on behalf of the everyday american so i thought i would just bring a couple of visual aids and also some information this is the source of the college board 2005 as it relates to the census and what americans are dealing with i want to start with this next chart here i want to start with this chart minimum wage and this is real economic change under bush here you have the minimum wage that is at zero starting in 1997 to now since 1997 to now whole milk has gone up 24 percent bread has gone up 25 percent a 4year public college education has gone up 77 percent health care insurance has gone up 97 percent meanwhile americans are still making 5 and change regular gas has gone up 136 percent still no message from the republican majority for everyday working americans that punch in and punch out every day li 2310 here are some other statistics still from 1997 no increase in the minirhum wage for everyday working americans college tuition has gone up in private institutions 40 percent gas prices again as it relates to the middle class has gone up 47 percent and 55 percent for prescription drugs i think it is important that we look at those to go further i think it is important that we share this the facts are hard but they are true in 1998 a member of congress received a raise of 3 100 that was in 1998 in 1998 the minimum wage was zero again in 2000 members of congress received a 4 600 raise that is more money everyday working americans in 2000 minimum wage zero thanks to the republican majority i just said in 2000 mr delahunt members received a pretty substantial raise in 2001 members of congress received a 3 800 raise of course we are not minimumwage workers the american people in 2001 zero nothing the republican majority said they are not going to have it in 2002 again a 4 900 that is a lot of money increase for members of congress the american people in 2002 zero it pays to have a voting card in congress you can give yourself a raise but the folks that elect you just have to suck it up now this is like on a roll here in congress in 2003 a 4 700 increase in members of congress pay the american people guess what zero nothing at alr thanks to the republican majority in 2004 a 3 400 raise for members of congress guess what members american people minimum wage raises zero these are the facts i challenge any member on the republican side the majority to come down and challenge me on these facts in 2005 it continues a 4 000 raise once again you are a member of congress that comes up here who say they are representing you it is a wonderful thing get a raise in 2005 4 000 the american people zero in 2006 members of congress proposed raise 3 100 mr delahunt my 9yearold son and my 11yearold daughter can guess the american people to this date zero now i want to go back to this chart because i think it is very revealing and very accurate i have been in this business for 25 years and i never voted for an increase in the minimum wage and i am opposed to it and i think that a vast majority of our conference is opposed to it that is the leader of the republican congress that is the majority leader now mr delahunt there are members that come to this floor and say the democrats are just demagoguing there are people who come to this floor and say we are for you they are not for leading i think it is important mr delahunt that we come to the floor and share with the american people and the members of congress that we will not rest even though we are in the minority that we are still willing to fight for them now the difference between the republican majority and the democratic minority is the fact that the majority has the power to be able to make things happen here in this house on behalf of the american people as it relates to the minimum wage and it is fair play i went through this list pay increases year after year 4 000 here 4 700 there 3 100 here and zero since 1997 on behalf of the american people who punch in and punch out every day meanwhile health care cost is up meanwhile the cost of bread and milk is up meanwhile gas prices are up by 136 percent but back at the ranch and here in this house the members of congress are being taken care of the special interests are being taken care of but guess what the individuals who woke up early on a tuesday morning for representation are being left behind since 1997 and there are members on the majority side saying over their dead bodies literally will they receive an increase because they are so indebted mr delahunt to their special interests so all we can fight with here is the fact not fiction but fact that we have a republican majority that is willing to govern for the few for those individuals who have the opportunity to come to washington and to be able to gain access through the k street project and other programs that allow them to give politically and have gangs here in the house a former member of this house used to boast about the fact that if they were not on the list of contributors they couldnt come in and see them that is a former member of the house and if anybody wants to challenge me on it from the majority side i will be happy to reveal that former members name i think we all know and it was an active program in the house and i believe there are still some elements of that program now the fact that special interests do not want an individual making 5 and some change to receive a couple dollars increase is very unfortunate and mr delahunt i am very concerned about that let me just take 3 more minutes mr delahunt and then i am going to yield to you because you have some very interesting charts over there let us talk about who is getting what in the past you have heard me read this and i want to read it again because when it comes down to when their constituents want to know whose side they are on i want the members to be armed with the facts i am proud that i am trying to do everything i can do on behalf of my constituents back in the 17th congressional district in dade and broward county but by their sending me to congress and mr delahunt to congress they federalized us to represent the people of the united states of america and i think it is our obligation to share the facts members can follow me they can go on washingtonpost com this was an article november 16 2005 on the front page a white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president dick cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long suspected by environmentalists but denied as recently as a week ago by industry officials testifying before congress the document obtained this week by the washington post shows that officials from the exxonmobil corporation phillips shell oil company and bp america inc met in the white house complex with the cheney aids who were developing national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated here in the house this is an article it is not from the democratic caucus it is not from my office or mr delahunts office let us see what happened that meeting mr delahunt and members was in 2001 here are the profit margins of big oil companies since that meeting in 2002 i think that was a pretty good meeting to go to 34 billion in profits thanks to the republican majoritys passing policy that would allow oil companies to spend tle taxpayers dollars and to be able to have subsidies and make these profits in 2003 59 billion in profits i think that meeting was worth going to and whoever recommended and got them into the white house complex to meet with the cheney aides i think they got a promotion and possibly a bonus li 2320 in 2004 84 billion oil profits up guess who is paying for it the american people in 2005 113 billion in profits and the numbers are not even in from 2006 i know that these facts have to have some members who may be in their offices right now or sitting up in their beds feel uncomfortable but unfortunately that is not happening because it continues why is this man smiling here it is nothing against him i dont have anything personally against oil companies they are getting what the majority republican conference here in this house has allowed them to have it is one thing for someone to gay i will support you and your political endeavors it is another thing for you to say i am with you all the way even if it costs my constituents more at the pump here is a man that a lot of workers wish they had such a deal a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break ala the republican majority an exxon former executive it is almost unfair someone may say that if i didnt have the thirdparty validators the congressional record and votes by the majority to back up what i am saying some folks would say that is unfair i wouldnt even be able to walk the halls of congress or talk to my colleagues on the republican side if i wasnt telling the truth i think it is important that everyone understands if you are a republican you have to have a problem with what i just presented you have to if you are a democrat you have to have a problem the information i am sharing with you that the republican majority is allowing to happen we on this side have called for an increase in the minimum wage we on this side have called for tough legislation on price gouging we on this side have talked about making ourselves energy independent not investing in the middle east but investing in the midwest as it relates to e85 so i think it is important that everyone understands when we are in the majority if the american people see fit we will put forth policy that will benefit all americans i think it is important if you are an independent you have to have a problem with the fact that members of congress have received thousands upon thousands of dollars of raises since 1997 and still no response from the republican majority as it relates to the minimum wage"], [0.003010272979736328, 0.9969897270202637, 1, "a substitute amendment again on march 25 2004

we made the targeted investments focused in certain areas that yield results that yield tax money investments in education you get a good return on that we had a study done at the university of akron a few years back this was on state tax money in ohio but when the state spent 1 on tax money that went towards higher education they got 2 back in taxes education is a great investment lets make this investment lets invest and do it in a way that we can get a good return on our money down the line but today the republican congress has just been tied up in knots with the special interests the oil

street fairy tale the republican majority is borrowing money as we run these deficits and they give millionaires tax cuts 42 000 they are going to give them more next year as they do that and we run these huge budget deficits we cant fill the gap so this republican congress and this republican president they are going to opec to borrow money from opec to help plug the hole can you imagine it is like you are making it up it is another k street fairy tale that we have here running huge deficits gas is 3 a gallon you not only give the oil companies 16 3 billion in corporate subsidies but you also borrow money from opec countries to help plug the deficit because you are giving tax cuts to millionaires now i am not opposed to giving middle class people a tax cut i am not opposed to giving a small business a tax cut but i am against giving a millionaire 42 000 back when you are fighting two wars your average people are struggling tuition costs have doubled in the last 5 years and you are giving bill gates another tax cut that just doesnt make any sense i dont care what your party affiliation is that is irresponsible that is irresponsible governing and until we get the republican

homeland security all this kind of stuff but when it comes down to the printed word when it comes down to the budget that is handed out from the white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security substitute amendment defeated again so when you start look looking at the record and what the record says versus what is said here on the floor by the republican majority and the rubber stamp majority i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman schultz i cannot help but imagine the kind of chaos and protest and finger pointing and them and they and all of the things that will be said some of the stuff will have to be stricken from the record because the republican side will be carrying on about the democrats but they cannot say it they cant do it they cannot even kind of paint a picture because they have been in charge of the whole thing since it started so if the american people want a new direction if the american people want accountability if the american people want a house and a senate that will carry out article i section 1 of the unitedstates constitution and a lot of blood is on this constitution but if they want that then they will vote for a new direction in november i am done ladies and gentlemen with begging the republican majority to stand up on behalf of the american

wage meanwhile we are giving ourselves a nice fat pay raise every year 4 100 here 3 100 there oh we have the money for that but we dont have the money for the people who are punching in and punching out every day this has to come to an end and that is the reason why ms wasserman schultz that i believe there is a wind of change it may not be outside the hall of this chamber but it is out there in

priorities if that is indeed the case we really should question both one really has to wonder if this budget document represents his priorities you will remember 2 weeks ago during his state of the union address president bush spent the majority of that speech talking about his social security privatization plan and the continued war in iraq supposedly these were his priorities for the upcoming year and yet the president did not include the additional 80 billion needed to fund the iraq war or the trillions that will be needed over the next decade to fund his costly social security privatization proposal in his budget it is impossible for the president to reverse our nations fiscal collapse if he continues to send incomplete budgets to capitol hill the president can say that he is going to cut the federal deficit in half in several years but the fact is that cannot happen if the president does not send us an honest budget if social security and the war in iraq are the presidents priorities then he should have no problem placing them in his budget and explaining to the american people why these billions of dollars must be used in iraq and on his social security privatization plan president bush also said this budget represents a vision of his values now if that is the case one really has to question the presidents dedication to one of governments main rules helping those less fortunate once again the presidents budget helps provide the blueprint for republicans to help the wealthiest in our nation become even wealthier that is to the detriment of middleclass and lowerincome americans who greatly benefit from many of the programs the president now wants to cut or eliminate and for what more tax breaks that primarily benefit our nations wealthiest 1 percent the presidents budget shows his lack of compassion for programs that benefit my state of new jersey our middle and lowerincome families in particular by drastically cutting housing education community policing 6nvironmental protection anol medicaid programs the president is turning his back on middle and lowerincome families in my state of new jersey president bushs budget makes substantial cuts in important education proposals that are important to my state the budget provides only half of the funding promised for afterschool programs in new jersey these cuts will mean nearly 33 000 new jersey children will no longer have access to critical afterschool programs the presidents budget also cuts 440 million in safe and drug free school grants 500 million in education technology state grants 325 million for the even start literacy program and 280 million for the upward bound program for innercity youth now this may sound like a lot of bureaucracy but these are real education cuts that are going to hurt children and yet the president has no problem cutting those programs while at the same time continuing his policy of providing large tax breaks to the wealthiest americans now these are certainly not my values i would hope that they were not the presidents values but certainly the budget says the opposite the president also proposes huge cuts in the medicaid program now this program serves nearly 930 000 children seniors and people with disabilities in my state of new jersey it is estimated that the 60 billion in cuts that the president is proposing will cut onefourth of the medicaid money sent to my state over the next decade and new jersey and other states simply cannot pick up this slack we have a budget shortfall in new jersey we cannot pick up the medicaid slack at a time when 45 million americans are without health care the president shows absolutely no compassion for the uninsured by proposing these devastating health care cuts the president also refused to follow through with his promise during last weeks state of the union address or i should say a couple of weeks ago when he said he would do everything possible to help our soldiers and veterans recover well if you look at the budget there is a pitiful half a percent that is half a percent increase in veterans affairs funding now that is a slap in the face to the millions of men and women who have fought for our country congress should not neglect these brave americans and should instead reject the presidents budget proposal when it comes to veterans finally i just want to say the presidents budget values and priorities are in my opinion not in the best interests of america it is time that congressional republicans stand up to this president and let him know that his priorities are not the priorities of their constituents and i know they are not i hope congress will reject the presidents budget proposal in the upcoming months in favor of one

year the deficit has been shot up over 4 trillion there is a reckoning for that and i am here to tell you that as a member of congress the american people are looking for members of congress to stand

industrialized countries have gone down from 40 to less than 4 percent since the creation of the wto in 1994 unitedstates exports have increased by 300 billion of course the wto has also served as a useful forum to breakdown barriers to unitedstates agricultural exports where bilateral negotiations could not while i will vote against this repolution today it is not without any reservation i believe the resolution on the floor today provides the ideal time to pause and reflect on the shortcorgings of the current wto system and on ways both the congress and the administration can make changes to the wto structure so that it works better and rebuilds confidence in the system among our constituencies i find the lack of any serious effort to reform the current wto culture and structure to fix the flaws with the unsatisfactory there are a host of problems with the wto and the number of problems is only growing the wto completely lacks any degree of transparency hearings are closed to the pub lic and public transcripts are not released where in a very limited manner wto rules permit limited transparency by allowing the assistance and resources of private parties who h4316 are supportive of the unitedstates government position the administration has chosen not to utilize this allowance transparency is not the only problem contributing to the wtos failure to move rulesbased trade forward globally but it is the central factor allowing the wto and its bureaucrats to escape the scrutiny which would quickly eradicate other abuses in geneva through the lack of transparency the wto dispute settlement and appellate bodies are emboldened to disregard the proper standard of review in disputes involving trade laws for example in this way past wto panels have issued rogue decisions against the unitedstates with no basis or standing in the context of previously negotiated agreements this rampant judicial activism is rapidly undermining the support for the wto as the wto is particularly prone to yankeebashing support for the current broken system is perhaps fading fastest here at home a slew of activist decisions against the unitedstates attacking our trade remedy laws and another decision amounting to micromanagement of unitedstates tax policy have come at a steady pace these decisions have been particularly frustrating to many members of congress because of limited opportunity for oversight by congress of the wto or its decisions which affect our domestic laws and domestic employers i along with several of my ways and means colleagues last congress introduced the trade law reform act this legislation included a provision to establish a wto dispute settlement review commission this commission composed of retired federal judges would report to congress after reviewing wto decisions adverse to the unitedstates in order to determine whether the relevant decision makers failed to follow the applicable standard of review or otherwise abused their mandate today we have spent two hours debating whether congress should withdraw from the wto yet absent a new entity to administer and advance rulesbased trade there is no question that we must remain committed to and engaged in the wto i would submit that instead of debating whether to withdraw from the wto congress should have an active debate on ways we can make the current system work properly as it was designed to do and ways to make it better the unitedstates must move swiftly to put an end to judicial activism in the wto and reorganize the structure and culture of both the appellate body and the dispute settlement body additionally the ustr should deputize private parties with a direct and substantial interest in a case to appear and participate in wto proceedings and

troubled and distressed communities we have all seen these conditions that exist in public housing developments throughout the nation dilapidated buildings and homes rampant rodent and insect

contract out a certain function that there is a fair competition that would ensue between the federal employees who believe they should continue to serve that function and those who would wish to have the function contracted out there is a process by which the various costs and benefits are reviewed there is a process where the consequences are reviewed and then a decision is made the problem with the present process is this when the contractor wins the competition the employees do not have a right of appeal if they wish to dispute the finding on the other hand if the employees win the competition the contractor does have the right of appeal we think that this is an unfair and unfortunate policy the purpose of our amendment is to suspend the a76 process in the departments covered by

in the most local of matters why so that the developers can scare localities into not doing their most fundamental jobs now this time around the proponents of the bill have come up with some new ingenious arguments for the bill the only problem is that these arguments are wildly inaccurate so let me make this clear to my colleagues this bill does not deal at all with eminent domain or property seizures or the supreme courts kelo decision let me restate that it is so important this bill does not deal at all with eminent domain or property seizures or the supreme courts kelo decision which was decided years after the bill was written this bill is only about localities exercising their zoning authority it is not about localities taking property by eminent domain and by the way the substantive problem in kelo was that a developer was kicking people out of their homes this bill would only strengthen the hand of developers to an unprecedented degree so let us not undermine our

committees where there is bipartisan spirit at least some of the time and we are able to get a few things done and this is one of them the perkins act aims to prepare youth and adults for the future by building their academic and technical skills in preparation for postsecondary education and or employment the bill we are considering today enhances perkins by ensuring both secondary and postsecondary students participating in the program are acquiring rigorous academic and technical skills and will have the opportunity to transition into further education and or successful employment the perkins act governs widely supported programs of both the secondary and postsecondary level for example nearly all high school students complete at least one vocational education course and approximately 26 percent of students are considered vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will help states community colleges and other postsecondary education institutions and local educational agencies to better meet the needs of students participating in career and technical education i urge my colleagues to support this report so we may send this bill to

wilson on television who is mr joe wilson why would he want to use false claims to attack this bush administration mr joe wilson endorsed senator john kerry in october of 2003 according to media sources mr joe wilson contributed 2 000 to the kerry campaign in the same year the boston globe has reported that mr wilson spoke to the kerry campaign at least once a week during the campaign well he himself has even said that he advised the kerry campaign on foreign policy so now this kerry supporter and adviser is on television pointing fingers at the administration he despises now during my tenure as a judge credibility of witnesses could usually be judged by seeking to learn if the witness had a bias obviously this witness has quite a bias it has also been reported that he and his wife supported albert gore for president against george w bush in 2000 the motive for bias seems to deepen the press has reported mr joe wilson was in fact the last unitedstates diplomat to meet with saddam hussein in 1991 he was also the envoy sent to africa to investigate reports that the iraqi president had tried to buy nuclear material there was it possible he hated president bush so much that it got in the way of his ability to assess the facts and actions and motives of his old acquaintance mr saddam hussein perhaps his intentions were loyal to the security of the united states in 1991 but if that is the case while serving as an official envoy to niger as he claims it appears he brazenly spoke out publicly against our own administration the senate intelligence committee found that mr wilsons report rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to iraq actually bolstered the case for most intelligence analysis so now it appears that like his favorite former presidential candidate mr wilson is flipflopping the typically softspoken senator pat roberts chair of the senate se lect committee on intelligence was harsh in his condemnation time and again joe wilson told anyone who would listen that the president had lied to the american people that the vice president had lied and that he had debunked the claim that iraq was seeking uranium from africa not only did he not debunk the claim he actually give some intelligence analysts even more reason to believe that it may be true roberts went on to say that it was important for the intelligence committee to declare that much of what wilson said had no basis in fact contrary to what he has said publicly mr wilsons wife a cia employee did recommend him to serve as envoy in 2002 it appears obvious that neither mr wilson nor his wife had conducted themselves properly in the best interest of this country why would a former ambassador privately report inaccurate facts about iraqi officials potential dealings with business men in niger why would his wife float his name to serve as envoy on this trip if they wanted to stay out of the public eye i have come to know people after they retired from being covert agents of the government it seems that the best covert agents are the kind of people who go into a room and when you look around that room you do not notice them they blend in they keep their names off lists so they do not make contributions especially to political figures they keep a low profile they certainly avoid having their picture put in popular magazines it really appears that the wilsons disdain for this administration will likely go down as one of the greats in history but they have been so blinded to something we would call the truth some of our colleagues across the aisle and senate democrats down the hall have embraced this man on little credibility in efforts to harm this administration that is determined to protect us from evil men with evil motivations desiring to destroy our way of life their rhetoric is based on two news storiesboth of which appear to exonerate rove the facts are simple joe wilson said the vice president sent him to niger and that his report was shown to the vice president the senate select committee on intelligence confirmed that rove was right and wilson was wrong the vice president didnt send wilson anywhere karl rove then discouraged a reporter from writing a false story that was based on a false premise promulgated by a lying or blindly prejudiced mr joe wilson the main questions now on the matter should be what else has joe wilson lied about and why is anyone putting him on television perhaps if recommending a blindly prejudiced man to go to niger to do critical research for our country is any indication as to mr

every citizen of this country should be able to vote unencumbered i believe actually that the voting rights act has been and is a good thing and it should be reauthorized i nor anybody i know is trying to do away with section 5 though i continue to hear it over and over again today we battle a phantom that has haunted this chamber since the day probably it was first built it has stalked us since before we were a nation it poured the curse of slavery on our infant republic it fed the flames of regional conflict until we suffered the most devastating war in our history it gave birth to segregation poll taxes and literacy tests this specter embodies what is perhaps our nations original sin discrimination it has dunned us with a moral debt that maybe can never be fully paid i pray that is not the case but then again maybe it is only waiting for a generation with the courage to exorcise that demon out of our hearts and out of this land our forebears in spite of their many blessings that they left us failed this challenge they had the chance with dred scott and instead decided that slaves were not human beings they had a second chance with jim crow but instead built a segregated society today we have a rare chance and i mean rare to revisit the fundamental issue discrimination that our predecessors avoided dealing with discrimination is the creation of laws or systems that deny a person the same rights enjoyed by their fellow human beings not because of what they do but because of who they are in 1965 that meant white people in many areas of this country and especially in my beloved south set up legal hurdles that kept people of color from voting not because of what they did but simply because of who they were the voting rights act passed by this house in 1965 stopped that practice it did so by temporarily denying the voters ofmy state and others their constitutional right to determine election practices without federal interference this harsh measure known as section 5 oversight was not discrimination it was not laid on these jurisdictions because of who they were but because of what they did now this is a profound point forty years later there is not a single member of my state legislature who served in 1964 particularly the democrats under those discriminatory laws seventy percent of todays georgians did not live in georgia in 1964 they are either dead or have moved away under these discriminatory laws they were either unborn or have since moved perhaps somewhere else yet h r 9 would leave all these people who have committed no wrong with diminished election rights not because of what they do but because of who they are this is blatant discrimination based on nothing more than where we live all who dwell on a particular type of soil section 5 soil now have their constitutional rights curtailed is the earth beneath our feet guilty of the crimes of man does it then condemn all who trod on our soil that is the contention of h r 9 as it ravages the rights of the innocent those whose only offense is in where they live unlike h r 9 the voting rights act did not condemn the righteous with the wicked it reserved its penalties only for those jurisdictions where offenses had occurred and only until those injustices were corrected it was not a life sentence and certainly not a sentence on those yet unborn georgia now outperforms the nation outperforms the nation in every area of black voting turnout registration the success rate of black candidates in our state yet h r 9 turns a blind eye to these facts and seeks to let the innocent continiue their punishment for another quarter of a century either we restore their voting rights to equality or the supreme court will be forced to do it for us and the court will do so in ways far more damaging to section 5 than any reasonable amendment that i am going to bring later today that we could devise the days of allowing the ghost of the past to discriminate against the living are and should be coming to an end our choice today is whether it will end through carefully crafted amendments or will it be through the judicial act all we are trying to do is change section 5 so that every citizen in this country whether you are from tennessee whether you are from wisconsin have the same equal rights that minorities in georgia have and when you get time look at these maps on the right it shows you everybody that is in white is not under section 5 if you are in a colo you are under section 5 everybody on the map on the left covers 39 states that actually have been guilty of section 4 of the voting rights act i do not understand how you cin go home and you can say you are all for equal rights fair rights protections for voters in georgia but it is not all right to have those same protections in tennessee or in arkansas or in wisconsin or ohio what is wrong with looking at the whole nation everybody is not going to go under it everybody is not going to break section 5 formula but others are besides just us and on that map georgia stays under section 5 and i hate it i wish we were not ten counties might get out but they can only get out for 4 years the attorney general is going to be requested to look at it every 4 years and all across the country including ohio and including florida what is wrong with that i fail to understand why anybody would find fault you say that we have had so many objections meaning georgia i promise you an objection does not automatically mean discrimination we have had five objections since 2000 one of them came from a majority black city council and it was thrown out that puts us in the penalty box for another 10 years let me quote what my good friend john lewis said in an affidavit the state georgia is not the same state it was its not the same state that it was in 1965 or in 1975 or even in 1980 or 1990 we have changed we have come a great distance i think that its not just in georgia but in the american south i think people are preparing to lay down the burden of race clearly john is proud of georgias progress as am i congressman lewis is not alone in recognizing progress heres how my states african american attorney general thurbert baker testified before a federal three judge panel in 2001 the states georgia racial and political experience in recent years is radically different than it was 10 or 20 years ago and that is exemplified on every level of politics from statewide elections on down the election history for legislative offices in the georgia house senate and the united states congress reflect a high level of success of african american candidates but this is more critical the judiciary committee record seems to show that the problems that do continue to exist occur across the nation not just the states in the covered jurisdictions so why isnt the judiciary committee going after these current potential violations instead of dwelling on those from four decades ago since 1965 there have been 83 department of justice objections raised to voting changes in georgia and heres a critical point for the recorda doj objection does not equal guilt doj itself withdrew 14 of those 83 objections when my state tried to satisfy one of those objections in drawing congressional districts the district lines demanded by doj objection were then thrown out by the supreme court so objection does not equal violation fiftyfive of the 83 objections were in the first 10 years as the act was being implemented leaving 28 objections between 1975 and now only seven objections have been stated since 2000 well within national averages and again an objection is not a violation its now been 40 years since the voting rights act took effect georgia has a higher percentage of black elected officials than the overwhelming majority of states not included in section 5 federal oversight yet the federal oversight continues nationwide there are 9 101 black elected officials blacks make up 11 4 percent of voters and 1 8 percent of elected officials in contrast georgia has 611 black elected officials blacks make up 26 6 percent of our population and 9 3 percent of elected officials thats more than double the level of black representation of the nation as a whole black elected officials make up 20 percent of our state house and senate members and 30 percent of our members to the unitedstates house georgia has a black attorney general elected by voters statewide georgia has a black supreme court justice georgia and the south now lead the nation in civil rights achievements putting to shame the record of those states who continue to point their hypocritical fingers at the grave of bull connor yet georgia remains on the federal oversight list while states with a fraction of our percentage of black elected officials per capita remain oversight free if georgia remains on that list without modification then the majority of the people of a state who have committed no offense to minority voter rights whose legislators have committed no offense to minority voter rights whose state has one of the highest levels of minority elected officials in the nation will have their states constitutional right to determine political boundaries and election rules usurped without justification thats a clearcut violation of the unitedstates constitution and its voter discrimination against every georgian connecticut idaho maine massachusetts and wyoming were included in 1970 but successfully filed bailout lawsuits that allowed them to get off the list because no one had a political reason to object to successfully file a bailout the state must prove that during the past 10 years no scheme such as poll taxes or literacy tests have been used all changes affecting voting have been reviewed prior to their implementation no change has been the subject of an objection by the attorney general or the district of columbia district court there have been no adverse judgments in lawsuits alleging voting discrimination there are no pending lawsuits that allege voting discrimination and federal examiners have not been assigned as can easily be seen a simple accusation will keep a state off the bailout list for 10 years at a time doj can file an objection then withdraw it and thats all thats necessary to keep georgia under section 5 another 10 years there must be a more lawful means for the citizens of georgia to regain voting rights equality with the rest of america later today i will bring an amendment to ensure that all americans will have equal protection under the voting rights act under this amendment minority voters nationwide will have access to the same section 5 protections if there has been a violation of their rights at the same time all voters across america will be treated the same if there has been no violation in the last 12 years with this amendment the voting rights act will be restored to its original intentto end unjust discrimination in voting rights for all americans this amendment provides lawful means to win release from section 5 while expanding minority voting rights protections nationally it is the only

country it is the heart of what we are about as a people all of our documents our coins our institutions the constitution the declaration of independence all have recognized a being superior to ourselves we think that protection for that phrase and other phrases in the pledge is appropriate certainly we have not anticipated that state courts who by the way were also recognized by the early congress as appropriate determiners of some federal laws and early congressional determination in an early supreme court decision was that federal laws that have been upheld by the state courts would not be subject to federal review this is in line with our responsibilities it would be a responsibility some would like to suggest is different than it is but it is our responsibility i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
