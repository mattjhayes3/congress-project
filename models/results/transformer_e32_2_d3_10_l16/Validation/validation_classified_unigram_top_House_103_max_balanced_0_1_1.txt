mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on

request for an increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we are debating foday is itself another mystery the clintons have repeatedly denied requests from congress for a list of white

involved in any way subordinated to nonunitedstates control precisely who is making the call as to where and how unitedstates forces are employed against aldeed 2 what kind of unitedstates force was kept in reserve to support the contingent conducting the raid do unitedstates forces routinely depend on nonunitedstates forces to provide backup capability during military operations why did it take up to 7 hours for the un multinational contingent to reach the rangers pinned down in support of the downed helicopter 3 it is widely reported that the armored reinforcements going into somalia were actually requested by general montgomery backin early september is this true and if so why were they denied 4 president clinton expressed concern on monday for the adequacy of the protection for unitedstates forces in somalia has the joint staff centcom or anyone else in the command chain expressed concern prior to this past weekend about inadequate available capability to protect our forces 5 what capabilities will the mechanized company with one platoon of tanks give the unitedstates forces in somalia tanks are usually very vulnerable when used in city or builtup area as they lose their standoff and mobility advantage why do we think 4 or 5 tanks will give unitedstates forces a decisive advantage 6 why where the ac1z0s operating in june out of djibouti withdrawn 7 it has been suggested that the force levels we have in somalia are on the minimal end of the scale for what is required to support continued operations given this past weekends experience do we have enough forces in somalia even after the small reinforcements on the way do we have enough forces to enjoy a decisive advantage have we moved away from the decisive force doctrine 8 who authorized the change in the employment of the unitedstates quick reaction force qr from the original concept of a garrisoned reaction capability to their current use as a daytoday military force when the tactical mission changed did anyone reassess force requirements for the new mission 9 given the vulnerability of our helicopters why was this operation conducted in broad daylight how has the somali antiaircraft air defense capability evolved over the past few months since we dont have the forces to maintain open lines of communication on the ground and air mobility now appears to be in question how will our forces

post listen to this the president suggested in an interview with copley news service published yesterday that the united nations had changed its mission unwisely failed to provide military operation to back up peacekeepers and staffed the units with troops untrained for their jobs who refused to venture outside their areas and refused to take orders doesnt this sound like vintage clinton the president also referred to u n actions as if he and his u n ambassador has had no role in formulating or approving them the united states sits on the security council and can veto any risolution the clinton administration supported the resolution that established the peacekeeping effort in line with clintons campaign rhetoric of relying more on multinational institutions to address international problems when the united nations included efforts to hunt down aideed and his key aides for the murders of pakistani troope the clinton administration voted for the resolution but in the interview clinton expressed doubts about the operation he said the copley interview we were asked to come in and in effect be the police officer in this thing to start this thing going and then the u n shifted course and said we ought to stay there until nationbuilding takes place clinton said he did not want our young people in harms way in the absence of the united nations aggressively proceeding with a plant to turn this country back over to the somali or to have a longterm peacekeeping strategy that does not involve the united states but clinton made the commitment to leave the troops in somalia as part of the u n force when the mission changed the key decisonmaking point for the president at that time there was no specific date for turning the country back or any schedule for withdrawing all

whether they are young middle class families middle class federal employees or middle class eldery the middle class will be hit by the btu tax which will cost the average family approximately 500 in additional taxes they will be hit with fewer jobs an estimated 400 000 to 600 000 fewer jobs throughout the country including approximately 1 600 jobs lost in my district along according to the national taxpayers union every worker and every business throughout my state and throughout this country will be hit with this new tax big this will in turn hurt our competitiveness abroad as we raise the price of doing business for every employer and producer in the united states this btu tax penalizes lower and middleincome families hurt schools and hospitals and increases our dependence on foreign oil under this tax hospitals will have to spend more or energy and less on healing schools will have to spend more money on transporting kids to school and less on educating them parents will have to spend more money getting back and forth to work less on supporting their families adding tens of thousands of dollars to school and hospital budgets will have a devastating impact on local economies and dramatically harm the physical and educational welfare of millions of individuals the affordable energy alliance estimates that had this proposed btu tax been fully implemented in 1990 virginia residents and businesses would have paid 701 4 million in additional energy taxes a tax burden this large would hit virginias economy particularly hard at a time when we have defense cutbacks hitting our area disproportionately along with millions of federal employees who will be subject to a wage freeze the national association of counties has noted that these increased federal taxes will reduce local revenues and result in the need for local governments to increase property taxes sales taxes and service fees at a time when local governments are still experiencing the adverse effects of the recession again the middle class will be hit the hardest the elderly on fixed incomes are also hit hard under this clinton plan the democrat plan promises to raise taxes on seniors making as late as 25 000 and while the energy tax is indexed the income level at which social security benefits will be taxed at a higher level is not indexed so millions of seniors will graduate into this new tax bracket each year and this increased tax in a breach of trust with the american people will not be returned to the social security trust fund but will instead be diverted into the general revenue fund for increased government spending no country in the world has this kind of tax this tax will be very difficult to administer and will require all kinds of new regulations and regulators to enforce it this bill reserves for the treasury department the power to unilaterally change new energy tax rates expand or contract the products subject to the tax and the power to exempt certain taxpayers this means the rules on this tax can continue to be changed and businesses will be subject to ever changing rules again this will hurt competitiveness and is not fair the republican alternative to the democratic tax plan is superior in many respects and i will support it because it achieves considerable deficit reduction without the burdensome taxes which i have just described my republican colleagues who helped fashion this plan did so under considerable time restrictions and have made many tough decisions in crafting this plan the kasich plan will reduce the budget deficit by 352 billion yet does not increase taxes or touch social security benefits while the clinton plan places a disproportionate burden on federal and military employees and retirees the republican plan eases this heavy burden i believe the men and women who serve in the civil service and milltary should be treated fairly it is important to consider the longterm benefits of having a qualified and effective federal and military workforce and be cautious in producing shortterm savings at their expense unlike the clinton plan the republican substitute wont delay federal retirees cost of living adjustments and it wont put limits on federal employees colas or locality pay also it does not delay military retirees colas and it does not freeze military pay the way the democrat plan would do coupled with the tax increases federal and military employees and retirees would suffer more than any other segment of the population under the clinton plan the republican plan is a dramatic improvement over the tax and spend democrat budget however the republican plan has some aspects i am concerned about under the republican substitute federal employees retirement age would be increased from age 55 to 62 and nondisabled military retirees would have their colas delayed until they reach age 62 federal employees have relied to their detriment on certain promises made by their employer the federal government and these promises should be respecied no other nongovernmental entity can unilaterally alter the terms of an employment contract its illegal and wrong while the congress can change the terms of an employees employment or retirement legally it is still unfair i reiterate that the republican substitute is substantially more equitable to federal and military employees and retirees than the democrat version however if i had the opportunity to amend either version which i dont because the rules committee gagged every member of this body by only allowing one amendment on the floor today i would offer additional spending cuts to make up the difference in maintaining the federal and military employee and retirees benefits what could we possibly cut to make up the difference i suggest and many would agree that we cut funding for the superconducting super collider others concerned could find other cuts if given the opportunity under the rules plagued with dramatic cost overruns management problems and no foreign contnbutions to the projects as was promised i believe this is a project that we cant currently afford given our budget defict yesterday mr victor s rezendes director of energy and science issues resources community and economic development dmsion of the unitedstates general accounting office testified that the total estimated cost of the scc is not yet known but the projects total cost will exceed 11 billion this 11 billion is more than enough to keep our commitment to federal and military employees and retirees if this plan passes the house i would work to restore these benefits by cutting the scc all americans have a deep concern about the deficit which i share and want us to cut the deficit so our children and grandchildren

some of what was in this letter it was addressed to me i mean it says dear robert s walker and then it says to me you are one of a select group of democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for example there is an underlying paragraph here that says unfortunately newt gingrich and his rightwing allies succeeded in cutting our congressional majority in last years election and all i could say was yippee and so that was the right thing i also kind of had the feeling at that point that i ought to start flapping my right wing but the fact is that they are admitting here that the gentleman from georgia has in fact gotten his message across to the american people and that we are in fact beginning to win new majorities but then it goes on and it tells the american people a couple of fascinating things it says here because the success or failure of the clinton administration depends upon which party has control of the congress righto i say to my colleagues if you wanted to have the clinton administration succeed what tom foley is telling you in this letter is you want democrats in the congress if you dont want the clinton administration to succeed with higher taxes and more spending you want to change the congress the gentleman from washington is absolutely right and i am pleased that he sent me this letter then he went on down here this is a fascinating little p s that they put on the letter it says if the republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda well let me tell you after spending some time at home over the last several weeks and listening to what people are having to say about bill clintons agenda my guess is that this is an admission by speaker foley that the republicans are going to take control of the congress let me repeat that to you it says if republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda america at this point wants to cripple bill clintons agenda they have decided that this tax and spend is not what they want tom foley is telling you america what you should do tom foley is saying elect republicans to congress because if republicans gain control of the congress we will stop bill clintons

will allow us to bring to the floor tomorrow and that is a freeze plus 2 percent i wish my good friend the gentleman from minnesota would listen to this part of my talk a freeze plus 2 percent if we froze at last years spending levels plus a 2percent growth over the next 5 years we could reach a balanced budget by 1998 using cbos figures as far as income is concerned if we go back to a 3percent growth in tax revenues as we have had traditionally we would actually have a surplus by the year 1998 without a tax increase i hope all my friends across this country that may be paying attention to this debate will listen the republicans have the kasich plan which is far superior to the democrat plan in that it does not increase taxes and it gets to a lower deficit figure in 5 years second we have a plan that is a 2percent above freeze that gets us to a balanced budget without a tax increase so if you do not want your taxes raised america if you want to cut the fat and waste out of government spending if you want to take a meat cleaver to government then vote for the republicans because they are the ones that are trying to do something about it they will tell you we do not have a plan we have two plans the kasich plan and the 2percent plus freeze and both of them do it without massive tax increases they tell you we need more money they tell you we need 400 billion more in taxes ten years ago we were bringing in 500 billion in tax revenue and today we are bringing in 1 2 trillion we have almost tripled the amount of taxes coming into this country in 10 years and yet they want 400 billion more is that not amazing we have almost tripled the tax revenues coming in in 10 years and they still want 400 billion more and they are still not going to reach a balanced budget in 5 years our plan a 2percent plus freeze will get us to a balanced budget without any tax increases and that is what i think america wantscut spending cut spending not raising taxes and

you cant fogi all of the people all of the time president bill clinton and the democraticcontrolled congress are out to prove honest able uncoln wrong president clinton through his false gimmick packaging is trying to sell the american people into believing that his huge tax hike the largest in american history will go towards reducing the federal deficit president clinton and the democrats are conning the american people and this is why i checked with my doctors yesterday to get their approval to cast my vote against president clintons budget this vote is the first i have made since i underwent triple bypass surgery on july 16 to remove arterial blockage i believe this vote is crucial to my constituents and the country and this is why i am here before you instead of at home recuperating the democratic leadership claim that the goal of the clintons tax package is to pare 500 billion from the federal debt over the next 5 years what president clinton and the democrats fall to say is that even if they pass the presidents budget the nations debt will still increase by a staggering 1 2 tillion if this doublespeak is not insulting enough to the intelligence of taxpayers clinton and the democrats are trying to pull a fast one on american families and businesses by frontloading 275 billion of gross tax increases without significant spending cuts the clinton tax package heaps taxes on americans already struggling to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their families rather than making americans pay their fair share the clinton tax plan will ensure that americans will be sharing most of their income with the federal government maybe the president and the democratic leadership in congress have convinced themselves of this but my constituents are not persuaded history has demonstrated to us time and time again that increasing taxes does not reduce the deficit higher taxes means increased spending i ask you my colleagues the question my constituents have asked me how can these tax increases be justified with the knowledge that no mechanisms exist to cut spending in the budget three parts of this budget represent a particularly onerous tax burden that will affect the middle class seniors and anyone else in america who breathes the gas tax the social security tax and surprising new retroactive taxes first the gas tax this federal gasoline tax of 4 3 cents per gallon will be more burdensome to families living in the large states of the west and south california will not escape the affect of this tax this increase will tax gasoline diesel compressed natural gas and noncommercial aviation fuel california will be hit extremely hard since it has a large population that utilizes various forms of transportation transportation costs will inevitably increase the clinton energy tax is inflationary and will escalate the already spiralling tax burden passed on to american families the energy tax will stifle the economic recovery we see occurring right now according to the tax foundation it is estimated that 54 299 jobs will be lost in my state of california behind every number there is a human face a family someone who can blame their unemployment on clintons tax package next the tax on social security benefits or if you listen to the president a spending cut seniors will be penalized for working and saving for their retirement under the clinton tax plan even though in his manifest putting people first candidate clinton promised to protect the integrity of the social security trust fund he hag decided to balance the budget on backs of senors cintons proposal will affect seniors with incomes of over 32 000 or coups incomes over 44 000 by inrea the tax on 85 percent of their social secuty benefits in addition to this these taxes increase the elderly surtax on pensions ira withdrawals interest from municipal bonds and certifcates of deposit the tax revenues generated by these new taxes on seniors will then be used to fund other programs rather than going into the socal security trust fund the president should not wonder as he pillages senlors benefits to pay for other programs why in addition to te budget deficit he also must contend with the trust fund this elderly surtax is anything but fair the increase in the elderly surtax hits the prudent and frugel who live on ixed incomes accordlng to the heritage foundation it is estimated that in calilomia 566 328 households over 65 with incomes greater than 3 000 will be hit and more spedlically in my district 13 884 households affected the 29 billion clinton hope to rsm at the expense of our seniors could easily be achieved by implementing just a handful of seniors wastecuting recommendations that have been put before him seniors should be appalled that a president who was not even born while many of them were fighting in world wars to make the world safe for democracy and wordng to feed their families is now trying to pick their pockets to pay for his new spending programs ad speaking of new taxes id like to call my colleagues attention to language ticked away in the budget reconcillatlon bill the measure imposes an unfair rate increase in estate gift and generallonskipping taxes th would be retroactive to january 1 1993 the proposed increase which would raise the top rate from 50 percent to 55 per cent would hit many states and beneficiaries inciud many owners of famiyowned busnessee and famis this change is a radical deperture from tradition no retroactive change has been imposed since the estate tax was enacted in 1916 president clinton and the democrats are not satisfied wilh the amount of revenue mki through the largest tax increase i amercen hi o they sill went to rob the american people of more money american taxpayers are discoverng hey do not have muchleft to tax and to make matters worse president clntons so called budget cuts will not take effect unil he is out of office the crilon administratlon is raising taxes retroactive to january 1 1993 and prolonging spending cut for 4 year i truly doubt that thils is the type of change that amedcana voted for in november eighty percent of small busineses who file as individuals will be hit by these taxes president clinton conceded that up to 1 25 million smal business men and women could be paying this jincreased tax this is a huge sacrifice for the most vibrant facet of our economy the president and the democrat should follow the lead of every previous corgess that has consldered the issue and change the budget reconcillation bill to eliminate revactv taxes when you add it all up clintons budget reconciliation bill cannot possibly shave 500 billion from the federal debt he may ool some of the anedcan people into belevlng that it will but certainly not all and probably not even most the american people will remember this as they watch more and more of their paycheck go toward federal taxes president clinton portrays this package as change for america saying that it is lime the rich pay their fair share however president clinton is robbing everyone in america to pay for the congress insatiable

tells us and i find this unbelievable but i do believe it because it is their figures and they are based on their analysis that during the life of an individual 8 out of 10 americans will be the victim of a violent crime that is truly shocking but we all know it do we not look at what is happening in our communities this next oneis fascinating we just heard how during the 0year period that spending at al levels of government has gone up fivefold and welfare spendinghas 630 percent this next chart tells us about the miserable failure of liberalism in this country this chart shows starting hack here you can see in the 50s here is the poverty rate the poverty rate if falling falling falling falling and falling look when it levels offand goes back up this happens when lbj comes into power and launches the war on poverty look at the dramatic increases in spending the more spending goes up look what is happening to this line the line is level it goes down it goes up a little bit then herwe axre in 1990 whereit starts heading up of course these are the last years we have figures for so i cannot tell you more recently but the factof the matter is we have spent in this 30year period i believe 3 5 trillion that put us deeply in debt to alleviate poverty we have created a dependent culture that just saps up more and more of out taxpayer dollars this is resulting in broken homes and more violent crime of enormous proportions this is why we have got to have further time to really talk about this on another occasion next is births to unmarried women look at this line right here in 1960 it was about 5 percent of unmarried women who gave birth look over here in 1990 we are almost at 28 percent a fivefold increase what is happening to these children these children are emotionally deprived for the most part you saw that statistic on the 560percent increase in violent crime the fastest growing component of those violent crimes is juvenile crimes that is what we are creating by the social policies that are entirely misplaced here is the chart that illustrates the increase in welfare spending it is never enough all these trillions of dollars and we still havepeople in power in the federal government from the president on down who tell us oh we have got to spend more that is what president clinton was quoted as saying on the front page of the washington post last friday we have got to raise some more revenues and get this economy going which is totally inconsistent why so that we can spend more this is completely unbelievable then he has given us a plan and let us go back to this chart for a minute a plan which is going to add 1 trillion to the national debt cumulatively and which is going to end us up after the largest tax increase in history at the end of the clinton 5year plan with an annual budget deficit of s228 5 billion some plan the famlily we see federal taxes look at this increase in the average family with median income a family of four in 1948 paid about 2 percent of its total income to the unitedstates government in taxes the same family in 1986 paid 24 percent of its income to the unitedstates government in taxes and that figure went up where by 1990 it looks like over 25 percent now from 2 to 25 percent is a twelvefold increase a 1 200percent increase in taxes to the federal government that is truly dramatic this last chart which i think is very illustrative and maybe we can end on this note represents the federal budget deficit the annual deficit going clear back to the 1940s these are inflation adjusted now of course look at what we have during the world war ii years we have annual budget deficits one of them here looks like about 1943 we have an annual budget deficit inflation adjusted of about 680 billion this is truly staggering but look at what happens here of course during the war years this goes on then we get right to here which appears to be about 1947 you can see what it is it is about 180 billion a dramatic reduction just by way of comparison our budget deficit this year is 320 billion for the fiscal year ending september 30 we are not in world war ii under the clinton plan in 5 years we are going to go from 320 to 228 5 billion look at what happened here you go in 5 years from an enormous budget deficit here at over 500 billion and my word you are up to here where you have nearly 100 billion in surplus now can you see the chauge there it is a 600 billion change we went from deep deficit to surplus we are not in world war ii right now why can we not act more quickly why can we not eliminate these tax increases out the spending bring the economy back up by reducing the deficit reducing the regulation reducing the burdens on the family strengthening our families provide incentives for people to help themselves in the inner cities and in the suburbs and pull these families back together transmit family values make us stronger and better and make us

matthew ridgeway who died at the age of 98 it is a coincidence that general ridgeway should pass away 1 day short of the 40th anniversary of the armistice that ended fighting in korea where general ridgeway served as allied commander ill have more to say later about this outstanding soldier because my main purpose today is to set the record straight about the korean war almost every history book tells us the korean war ended in a draw it was not a draw we won perhaps because the fighting ended with an armisticenot an unconditional surrenderkorea has been known as the forgotten war forgotten between the triumph of world war ii and the frustration of vietnam only recently historians and the general public alike have started taking a second look at the korean war its as if the free world suddenly woke up and recalled that korea was where we made our stand korea was where we shattered the myth of communist invincibility beginning with our show of resolve in korea and finally with the peacethroughstrength policies of ronald reagan the soviet union was forced to concede that it could not expand its empire by aggression in fact it could be said with all fairness and accuracy that the berlin wall began to crumble not in 1989 but in 1950 ive talked to veterans who fought in two wars veterans who have gone through both korea and jungle warfare most of them say korea was the most brutal war in our history a lot of it was fought in 30belowzero winters our haste to demobilize after world war ii made a hollow shell of the army and so 540 illtrained and illequipped troops found themselves overwhelmed by the 90 000man north korean army that poured across the 38th parallel on june 25 1950 the unitedstates led united nations troops were nearly pushed off the peninsula but the north korean offensive was halted at the pusan perimeter on september 10 and 5 days later the marine assault at inchonhistorys last great amphibious landingbegan the rollback of communist aggressors our marines and soldiers pushed the enemy all the way back across the border and all the way back to the yalu river pyongyang north korea was the only communist capital ever liberated by the west but then the communist chinese entered the war and drove allied forces back on a 275mile withdrawal the 1st marine division fought its way out of a trap at the chosin reservoir writing one of the most glorious chapters in marine corps history it allowed americanled forces to rally a second time driving the communiste back across the 38th parallel and while peace talks dragged on for 2 years both sides slugged it out in fighting that recalled the trench warfare of world war i much of the credit for the rollback should go to general ridgeway he took over u n forces whenthey were reeling under the communist assault and restored morale that had been strained by heavy losses and bitter cold he was a front line soldier and with a series of wellplanned counter offensives he pushed the communists back that rollback was the sum of countless acts of incredible heroism i would like to say a few words about one of them capt william e barber was the commander of company f 2nd battalion 7th marines first marine division on november 28 1950 captain barber and his battleweary troops were assigned to defend a 3mile mountain pass along the divisions main supply line just after the marines dug in along a frozen snowcovered hillside they were attacked by a communist regiment after seven hours of bitter fighting the marines were surrounded although ordered to fight his way back to a relieving force captain barber asked to stand fast and risk his entire command rather than abandon his wounded and sever contact with 8 000 other marines trapped at yudamni althoug severely wounded captain barber remained in personal control moving up and down the lines in a stretcher to inspire his men and direct the defense throughout 5 days and 6 nights of savage fighting in subzero weather the marines pushed back wave after wave by a determined enemy when the company finally was relieved only 82 of captain barbers 220 men were able to walk away from their positions this heroic stand accounted for approximately 1 000 enemy dead witnesses said that frozen enemy bodies were stacked nine deep in the snow around the embattled marines more importantly captain barbers action was a decisive factor in the successful withdrawal of the division from the chosin reservoir deathtrap he was awarded the congressional medal of honor this is what heroes are made of our involvement in the korean war was symbolized by the brilliance and strategic leadership of gen matthew ridgeway and the battlefield valor of capt william barber alongside these two heroes were hundreds of thousands of soldiers sailors airmen and marines who suffered sacrificed fought and in 54 000 cases died to protect the freedoms we enjoy today and that is the point i would like to stress wars should be judged not by surrenders or by victories in set battles wars should be judged on the basis of who imposes his will on whom on that basis we won and the world knows it the north koreans wanted to enslave the south to unify the country under their harsh totalitarian rule and we stopped them it was the first time the tide of communism was turned it was proof that the free world had the will not only to defend itself but to advance the cause of freedom throughout the world it was the turning point in asia the war boosted japans recovery from world war f1 south korea was left free to transform itself into one of the pacific rims several great economic powers through 10 presidents the united states has kept its commitment to preserve that freedom and we will continue to keep that commitment because we must north korea has not abandoned its dream of conquest and until it does it will continue to face the will and resolve of free people years after the armistice we began to reap the harvest of what we sowed by marines at chosin or the 23rd infantry regiment at heartbreak ridge it was on those desolate freezing hills so far away from home that the first hammer blows were made against the berlin wall and the statues of lenin and stalin it was korea that inspired the contras of nicaragua the mountain fighters in afghanistan and the peasants of el salvador to resist the communists i would further argue that there is a connection between the sacrifices made on pork chop hill and the blossoming democracies in budapest prague warsaw and other former communist countries besides seoul itself those newly liberated cities can take comfort from the progress of seoul from those dangerous days more than 40 years ago what a contrast between the two states north and south of the 38th parallel on the korean peninsula the south boasting of a 200 billion gross national product while the socialist workers paradise of north korea stagnates with a gnp less than onetenth the size it was a lesson for the whole world to see in the laboratory of korea free market principles proved superior to the unfeeling rigidity of marxism but those gains were not made without sacrifices and the people of south korea have not forgotten the sacrifices our troops shared with them to preserve their freedom and secure their future prosperity when edward reeves a quadrupleamputee from wounds suffered at chosin returned to korea for the 1988 olympics people would come out on the street to thank this american in a wheel chair if i had to do it all over again reeves said yes i would that is the voice of americas korean war veterans and i would hope that all future history books reflect the truth of the korean war that it was a great victory the first victory in the ultimate defeat of

referring specifically to north korea many have in the last few weeks read extensive media coverage on north korea and the situation that we have on the korean peninsula this is a situation that must be taken by every american citizen very very seriously it is a situation that directly involves 37 000 american soldiers and it involves probably 14 000 to 16 000 american civilians and if a conflict were to break out on the korean peninsula it would involve the entire world not only from an economic point of view but certainly the stability of peace in the world as we know it so i would ask tonight that you bear with me as i discuss a little about korea we are going to talk for a few minutes about the history of korea we are going to talk about the politics ofkorea we are going to talk about the military readiness of korea we are going to talk about the nuclear situation over in korea and finally talk about a few solutions what direction should this country take in regard to north korea let me start out by defining north korea which in my opinion is a lot like a grizzly bear i am from colorado and bears are a big thing back there a grizzly bear and grizzly by the way stands for the word horrible the horrible bear that is why the grizzly bear got its name grizzly bears are sometimes predictable and sometimes not so predictable but there are some things you can do with the grizzly bear in order to judge that behavior the best that we know bow first of all obviously you never pick on the cubs second of all you prepare yourself for a confrontation if you are going up into the high country of alaska or canada where grizzly bears are known to roam you prepare before you enter into those mountainous territories so you are not unprepared when the grizzly bear approaches it has always been thought that the grizzly bear can sense fear if the grizzly bear does not sense fear the grizzly bear turns and runs it the grizzly bear senses fear you have got a real problem on your hands korea is not a whole lot different than that north korea in my opinion now to start this evening let me mention a couple of articles that i think would be very helpful for the average joe and average jane out there that want to know a little more about what is happening in korea i thought time magazine june 13 1994 had an excellent article in addition to that so that you have a geographical understanding of what north and south korea are about and what military options might be available i suggest that you look at the map contained in that july 13 time magazine article in addition i know that many of you may not subscribe to the heritage foundation an excellent foundation here in washington but they have a memorandum it is no 224 memorandum no 224 called defusing north koreas nuclear threat this is written by darryl plunk darryl plunk is an expert in korean matters i know darryl in fact i was in korea i just returned from korea about a month ago i spent time with darryl over there he is well respected i think his article addresses very clearly the kind of challengethat we face on the korean peninsula both of those articles i would recommend to you for some very basic knowledge on what our situation is in korea let us start out by looking at a little geography to assist us here i have brought down a map as most of you know south korea is down on the southern end obviously it is divided by what is called the dmz the dmz runs right along in this area above that is north korea north korea is a very mountainous type of terrain it has a lot of weather similar to the state of colorado right now however the peninsula up there is going through the monsoon rains north korea the access across the dmz is limited again that map in time magazine lays that out very well for you up here on the northern tnd of north korea the largest border on the peninsula is with the country of china we are going to come pack to china and discuss china a little more when we talk about economic sanctions to give you a little history north korea is a dictatorship in my opinion it is a communist dictatorship i noticed the north koreans have recently continued to refer to themselves as a socialist society it is a clear communist type of dictatorship in north korea the dictator in north korea is a gentleman by the name of kim iisong kim iisong is estimated to be 82 or 83 years old and he was installel into power by josef stalin in about the late 1940s in 1950 in june 1950 much to the surprise of the united states congress much to the surprise of the president of the united states president truman this dictator kim ilsong who is the dictator that rules the country today under the pretext of military exercises launched a surprise attack against south korea there is no need to say much more about that attack because we all know about the korean war ironically it was never declared as a war there were still 114 000 fatalities from our country alone so the same dictator that ordered it is the dictator we are having difficulties with today why do i bring that history up it is important history to understand that this dictator has taken it upon himself before to immerse his people into a very intense war and we cannot underestimate his courage if you call it that his insanity if you call it that or his just pure stubbornness if you call it that to launch a military attack now let us move very briefly to the military comparisons between north and south korea again i do not mean to keep referring to that time magazine article but i think it is necessary because that article is very simple and lays out some of these comparisons when you look at the numbers of troops north korea outnumbers the south koreans and american troops 2 to 1 now in south korea we have a united nations command we also have the unitedstates forces we have the south korean forces the combined command in the forces the commanding general over there is a very competent verycapable very tough general by the name of general locke i had the opportunity when i was in korea to spend many hours with him and his staff i came away from there feeling very confident about the military leadership we have got if in factwe provide those military people with the necessary arsenal and tools to carry out their job now let me give you some comparisons north korea 1 200 000 troops south korea and the united states about 235 000 troops south korea has the probability of calling out reserves of 2 million more people north korea the latest numbers i saw has the potential of calling out 6 million people in reserves main battle tanks 3 700 in north korea and approximately 1 900 in south korea artillery 10 000these are multiple rocket launchers10 000 in north korea about 4 600 in south korea air defense guns and this is an important statisticair defense guns and surfacetoair missiles 18 000 in north korea and about 1 500 in south korea let us talk for a minute about the importance of air ballistic missiles korea does not need a nuclear missile to launch an attack against south korea in fact i personally would be surprised if they used a nuclear weapon my primary concern with north korea is that they are going to sell these nuclear weapons but they do not need a nuclear weapon to launch a very devastating very deadly and horrible war on the korean peninsula take a look the most strategic point you have got in south korea is the community of seoul the capitalof south korea onehalf by the way of the countrys population onehalf of the countrys gross national product and less than 30 to 40 miles away from north korean ballistic missiles you do not need even more than one missile to launch into a city of 15 million people to create a panic can you imagine a missile going off in the dmz landing in seoul the kind of panic it would wreak in fact i think panic is going to be our biggest problem if in factand god forbidbut if we do have a military confrontation panic will be our biggest problem these ballistic missiles are located along the dmz several key areas up here and they have a significant ballistic missile system now a lot of people look at the korean peninsula and we should all be justifiably proud about the job the kind of operation we did in the persian gulf iraq was rumored to be this huge force that we would suffer huge casualties that this was an army of might the united stateswent into the persian gulf with the pride of our american people our american service people and we got a quick and decisive victory not so in korea not so at all north korea will have a real fighting force it is ironic that several years ago the north koreans tried to attack the blue house which is the same as our white house in the united states the home of the president in south korea twenty north koreans 20 north koreans attacked the blue house they were completely surrounded very quickly those 20 north koreans had no chance absolutely no chance of survival except through surrender no chance and every one of those north koreans fought to their death even under those circumstances this force has got a heavy militia now we clearly have air superiority north korea has some of the most sophisticated tunnel systems in the world they have a philosophy that the peninsula should be reunified they have unaltered loyalty to their dictator kim flsong by the way kim i1songs son about 52 or 53 years old while the loyalty is not as intense for the son there is still a following of the father son in north korea so this will be a force and unlike the persian gulf this will be if the conflict occurs a conflict in which we suffer immense casualties which will re quire a tremendous amount of resources devoted to that peninsula to sustain that action or hopefully not but to retake the peninsula should the north koreans be successful enough about the military issue let us talk about the issue that has heated up and where we are today let us talk about the nuclear issue we have always been concerned about a nuclear arms race over in east asia east asia is a very important economic center for the entire world the security for eastern asia has been provided primarily by the united states since the end of world war ii for the most part that economic security blanket and military security blanket has provided a great deal of stability east asia has been fairly stable granted we had the vietnam war and so on but i am talking about the korean peninsula and japan and taiwan we have seen very prosperous economies the economy in south korea is a tremendous economy there is good leadership in south korea north korea has a very very poor economy but the nuclear issue and what concerns us is that east asia would get into a nuclear race several years ago we had a number of countries well over 100 sign what is called the nonproliferation agreement what that agreement calls for or preventshopes to prevent through the enforcement of an association called iaearemember those initials iaea because you will hear those a lot as we talk about the nuclear issue the nonproliferation agreement was a hope that we all had that we could stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and instead we could bring this world together as an economic center so to speak and that the wars and the fears of nuclear war or the fears of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of a third world country or a country without stability could be minimized well the only way that the non proliferation agreement works obviously is if the participants of the nonproliferation agreement agree with its terms north korea has refused over and over and over and over again to comply with the agreement that it signed on the nonproliferation agreement our president in response to this noncompliance in november of last year made a very clear statement to the north koreans you must never have excuse me i am wrong it is not you must not it is you can never have a nuclear weapon well our president has spoken some very strong words remember my comparison to the grizzly bear if you come face to face with a grizzly bear and you stand there and you look right at him you do not have a gun you have no choice you stand and you look strong the grizzly bear in all likelihood unless you have a cub there will walk away but if the grizzly bear senses that you are going to back off the grizzly bear knows weakness it is the same thing with north korea north korea understands two things they understand strength and they understand weakness if you have a president who makes a strong statement he needs to be able to back that statement up since novemberand i am not trying to be partisan because i think when we talk about foreign affairs we have to lift ourselves above partisanship and worry about the welfare of this country and the welfare of the entire world but since that november statement our country has shown in my opinion a great deal of weakness in its negotiations with north korea example north korea we know has about nine suspect sites for the development of nuclear weapons in korea now remember we have limited intelligence in north korea we really rely very heavily on satellite intelligence and satellites of course cannot pick up what is going on on the ground and we have to have good weather north korea is the most closed society in the world it is very difficult to get ground intelligence out of north korea it is very difficult to do ground intelligence out of north korea very difficult to do this so of the nine sites under the nonproliferation agreement a team from the iaea is allowed to go in and inspect these sites the north koreans have said no then they said yes then they said maybe then they said no then they said okay then they said no then they said come on over then they said no then they said come over and look at a couple of sites then they said no then they said come on over and we will let you look at seven sites but not the two suspect sites this last week they said you can never look at the two most highly suspect sites where you think we are developing nuclear weapons i saw a comparison it said it is kind of like walking through the customs when one comes into this country walk through customs and tell the agent yeah you can go ahead ive got nine suitcases you can go ahead and look at seven of them but im going to point out to you which seven suitcases you can look at the other two suitcases which i pick you cant look at it is clearly flying in the face of the nonproliferation agreement which is really much broader than the nonproliferation agreement because we are talking about a country like korea who soon will have the technology to do what korea is doing and if we do not have an agreement that is enforceable we will have an arms race throughout the world an arms race that the next generation the next generation will have a very difficult tirm dealing with so this agreement means a lot more than just relationships between the united states and north korea or south korea and north korea it really talks about the beginning of an arms race let us talk about some of the ideas dealing with the failure of north korea to comply with the nonproliferation agreement or the inspections i say first of all if you look at north korea they always pay attention as i said earlier when you speak from a position of strength we unfortunately in the last year and a half or couple of years have shown some weakness on foreign affairs in haiti in somalia in bosnia and in north korea and so the north koreans i think believe they can play cat and mouse with us in fact i think they rather enjoy it its a very dangerous game back to the grizzly bear its kind of like poking a grizzly bear when its asleep if its in hibernation and youre sure its in hibernation no problem if its not you better watch out so the nonagreement of north korea and some of the options that are available to force them back into the agreement should be discussed one of those is and i hear it from my colleagues and that is to take a preemptive strike we know for example up here in yongbyon up in that area right in here that there is a nuclear site up there a nuclear reactor there in fact that is the one my colleagues have been reading a lot about where the rods have been removed in the last couple of weeks and there are some that would suggest we take a preemptive strike that we certainly have the capabilities to take that facility out in my opinion a preemptive military strike would be crazy it is not well thought out a preemptive military strike against north korea can assure us of one thing and that is a war on the korean peninsula a war that will have devastating results a war in which many of our 37 000 troops and many of the thousands of subsequent troops that we sent over to korea will lose their lives will pay the ultimate price so a first strike is not a good option even if we carried out the first strike from a military point of view it may not be successful if the key ingredients that we are tying to destroy are stored deep underground and the probability is that they are stored deep underground even if we are successful and we hit a nuclear facility the unfortunate thing is if we set loose radiation the trade winds tend to go this direction would go over seoulremember the population center of south koreaand eventually make its way down over tokyo ind over japan so a first strike preemptive strike against nuclear facilities is not a good option in my opinion will simply start a war well what is the next thing well we heard the president talked a lot in the last few weeks and we heard some very educated scholars and some very welllearned people on korea suggest economic sanctions there are two factors for economic sanctions to work first of all china has to agree that it will not veto the economic sanctions in the united nations security council and second of all even if china does not veto those economic sanctions that china will agree to enforce the economic sanctions remember i said earlier that north korea is the most isolated country in the world they do not have a lot of trade like the united states does for example they are not like taiwan where they trade all over the world or japan they trade primarily with one country and that country is china here is the border remember we looked at the border earlier if that border is not secure if china does not exercise the economic sanctions along that border then economic sanctions will cost this country tens of millions of dollars we will have very minimal impact upon north korea and we will not accomplish what i think is the key goal china in just the last couple weeks the president and this is incredible to me the president the secretary of state have said on and off again that china they think they are going to get china to cooperate with us china is not going to cooperate with economic sanctions they are not going to let this occur just in the last week and a half or so ago china has said that north korea are the quote blood brothers does that sound like the kind of talk that is going to get cooperation from china especially after we have already given to them the mostfavorednation status so we really do not have much to swap with them i do not think china wants to see a conflict on the korean peninsula but their relationship with north korea goes deep remember we were about to overrun the koreans when we finally launched our counterattack in the korean war in 1950 the reason that it was stopped the reason that the korean war came to a stalemate is because china dumped its troops in to face us from the north china has a long history with north korea and they are not about to put that aside to assist the united states with economic sanctions now japan is beginning to play a very important role in this many of my colleagues have probably heard the events of the last couple of days where korea has come out and given a very clear warning to japan back off if you dont back off we have got missiles that can hit your countrys mainland this is more of a confrontation between the south and north than between the united states we have a good ally in japan we have a good understanding with japan but look at the politics in japan for a few minutes first of all there are about a half a million korean citizens who are now living in japan and these descendants of korea came from japan over the years between say about 1910 and 1945 when japan occupied the korean peninsula and brought slave labor into japan and as a result there have been descendants through the generations so about 500 000 korean descendants live in japan they are very loyal to the korean peninsula and they send a great deal of money about a billion dollars estimated as high as 1 8 billion in sympathetic money to korea to north korea every year now the japanese the leadership as my colleagues know they have had a lot of turmoil in their leadership and it does not appear that that leadership is entirely stable they are going through some very trying times we have very capable leadership in japan but japan is getting a little i think getting a little cautious about being involved in economic sanctions against north korea and japan we have said to japan look you of anybody ought to be concerned about this you will be if youre not already well within the range of nuclear korean missiles and those korean missiles could soon contain a nuclear warhead you have got to participate with us we have got to stop this before it gets out of hand but when it comes time to really do something about it as i said earlier japan is very cautious i think they are going to have a very difficult time stepping in there and telling their citizens who are korean descendants that they can no longer send money to their families in north korea well what kind of options do we really have we have talked a little about the history we have talked about the military we have talked about the consequences of a war on the korean peninsula if there were a military conflict in korea what kind of options do we have and again i would refer my colleagues i think to mr plunks article heritage foundation no 224 and by the way it is dated june 2 1994 it lays out some options i would like to add a little to some of those options first of all our president needs to be very strong in his message to the north koreans i believe that our message our president has to go further than he has gone now our secretary of defense mr perry i think has done a fairly commendable job in dealing with the north korean situation since he has come into office but it has to go above mr perry it has to go directly to the president the president has told north korea that their country would be destroyed as they know it i am not sure they take the president seriously i do not think they took the president serious since november when he said they cannot really have a nuclear weapon and then flipflopped around as to whether they should have one a few of them are ok or so forth our president needs to make it very very clear that north korea should not miscalculate what the intentions of the united states of america are first of all i think the president needs to assure north korea that we would not take a preemptive strike against their country but in the same statement the president needs to make unequivocally clear to north korea that should north korea launch an attack against south korea and the united states that we will use whatever weapon in our arsenal is necessary to destroy their country in other words north korea a military conflict would be a gross and fatal miscalculation on your part so we need a firm statement from the president we need to be prepared militarily again if you are going out into the mountains up in alaska or canada into that high country you need to be prepared if you are prepared you are not going to have any difficulty north korea understands strength we have got an excellent command force over in korea the south korean forces that i met with and commanding officers i felt were very capable but we need to shore up our defense we need to immediately in our opinion begin to move more naval force into the area and i think we need to do this very prominently so that people see what is going on i think we need to shore up our capability with our air superiority i think that we have to have a carrier task force an additional carrier task force moved into the area i think that we have got to prepare our troops for war and i think our troops are prepared but i think that north koreaneeds to get the message that should they decide to engage in a war that the united states of america is not only ready for the war but ready to end the war very quickly on our terms if you have a strong defense i do not think there is any better way to stop a military conflict than that defense it used to be in the cold war we talked about deterrence and there is a difference between deterrence and defense deterrence is where let us say there is a fellow named mel mel is sitting out here and mel has a missile and i have a missile now mel is smart enough to know that if he uses his missile against me i can still use my missile against him so mel and i just kind of stay at arms length with each other that is called deterrence deterrence will not work in korea what will work in korea is a strong strong de fense i think what we need to do in addition is the president needs to make a personal trip i think the president needs to visit china i think the president needs to visit japan now the president found time to visit oxford university mr president the most serious international problem that we have right now is korea the two most important allies that we have in korea are japan and china and i support you 100 percent in working with those two partners but maybe you ought to go sit down with them maybe you ought to tell them the importance of their cooperation in nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in east asia maybe we ought to make it clear to japan that it cannot continue to allow its citizens to send 1 billion or 2 billion a year to korea if in turn they expect our young american soldiers to go over and be willing to give their lives in defense of japan i think that our president has got a lot of groundwork to cover i think he is capable of doing it there has been a lot of criticism about the presidents military background there has been a lot of criticism and i happen to think a lot of this criticism is justified on our presidents weakness in foreign policy but our president does have the capability to communicate and if ever there was a time for communication if ever there was a time for us to get behind our president and hope that he could communicate in the clearest of terms it is now on the korean peninsula to the people of this country and to my colleagues in here this is a very very critical situation it is a situation that we cannot allow to continue without clear policy and a clear message and a showing of strength we do not want a war on the korean peninsula any more than you want to run into a wounded grizzly bear on a trail up in the mountains you do not want that to happen finally and let me conclude with this one of the things that i think is very important for us is to approach north korea and say whats up we know you know what is going to happen if you continue to push these nuclear weapons you have got a lot better future for your country and a lot better future for the people of your country if you join the market look at what has happened in russia look how much chinahas improved look at your own blood brothers down in south korea look what its done to their economy when they come into a capitalized type of system you dont have to ct~ange from communism to capitalism open up your doors open up your doors to the rest of the world stop your isolation it is a winwin deal for you north korea if you stop the isolation come into the world start trading with the world youre going to have north korea countries throughout the entire world giving you foreign aid youre going to have countries throughout the entire world wanting to invest in your country to put money into your country what is wrong with a country like north korea when they have such isolation not long ago i had an opportunity to give some graduation speeches and i talked about the difference between an 18yearold in north korea who would probably never taste ice cream in his lifetime has probably never seen a tv certainly has never flown on an airplane unless it is a military aircraft has never owned a car probably has never driven a car has never had an opportunity to go to department stores and pick out clothes has never had an opportunity to go down and buy a soda pop or enjoy some of the finer points of life compare that with the south korean 18yearold who has had those opportunities ice cream is abundant tvs modern life it is there north korea can provide that for its citizens and keep the hierarchy that it has they can preserve that leadership all that leadership has to do is open up to the rest of the world i hope that that is what north korea does every american should hope that that is what north korea does it would stop the proliferation at least starting on the korean peninsula it would show that there is an effective way to deal with nuclear proliferation and military confrontation without missiles i hope that is what happens but we as a country must prepare that that may not be what happens we as a country must be prepared not only for the best of times but for the worst of times right now the pendulum seems to be tipping toward the worst of times on the korean peninsula do not go to bed tonight thinking that there is going to be an attack tomorrow but do go to bed tonight thinking about the consequences if there is an attack tomorrow and the importance of our president of the leadership of this country to step forward and make sure that a military confrontation on the korean peninsula does not take

just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily because this continuous spending spree is about to sink this country into debt from which we cannot recover"], [0.9937865268439054, 0.006213473156094551, 1, "improve the way we conduct our legislative business its in our authorizing resolution its in our hearing record its in the member survey results and its in our final report the final report after repeating the authorizing resolutions mandate that we recommend improvements to strengthen the effectiveness of congress simplify its operations and improve its oversight and the orderly consideration of legislation then goes on to say and i quote in short the joint committee was formed to address how to make congress more effective accountable and credible mr swift argues that many of the goals cited by reformers are directly contradictory he would argue that you cannot be more democratic more representative more responsive more accountable and more deliberative on the one hand andumore efficient decisive orderly and productive on the other well it must be conceded that democracy is inherently inefficient and even messy at times and that the singleminded pursuit of efficiency and order can only diminish our democratic character but as far as i know to true reformers are urging us to commit democracide for the sake of making the trains run on time but i would argue that true reformers can have it both waysthat they can make this institution more efficient while also making it more open accountable responsive and deliberative these goals are not contradictory or mutually exclusive one of the greatest inefficiencies of this institution is the duplication of effort that goes on in our 22 standing committees and scores of subcommittees all because of something called multiple referrals that was an innovation of the 1974 bolling reforms before that any bill could be referred to only one committee but the part of the bolling committee reform package that was not enacted was the realignment of committee jurisdictions along more rational and functional lines so what we ended up with was pretty much the same tangle of jurisdictional responsibilities as before combined for the first time with the possibility that bills could be referred to two or more committees at a time or in sequence and the multiple referral authority which was mandated on the speaker encouraged committees to fight to broaden their jurisdictions even further into the territories of other committees so what we have endedup with is a double inefficiency two or more committees holding hearings and markups on the same bills and also expending time and resources in constant jurisdictional turf battles to preserve protect and expand their own legislative authority what we have proposed in the alternative on the republican side is that first we reduce the number of committees and subcommittees second realign and consolidate jurisdictions where possible third eliminate joint bill referrals require the designation of a principal committee for each bill and keep sequential referrals as discretionary with the speaker subject to time limits for reporting and fourth place strict limits on the number of committee and subcommittee assignments a member may serve on all these reforms are designed to make our legislative process more efficient by eliminating duplication of effort and maximizing the amount of time and effort a member may devote to each assignment moreover by pinpointing responsibility for each bill in a single primary or principal committee we will restore the kind of accountability which has been lacking since the institution of multiple referrals back in 1974 at the same time the implementation of these reforms should help to make the process more representative and deliberative with members having fewer committee and subcommittee assignments there should be greater member participation in hearings and bill markups meaning that the legislative products of these subcommittees and committees will receive fuller and more representative participation deliberation and results in short in the case of these reforms efficiency and deliberative democracy are not contradictorythey are mutually complementary and with fewer committees subcommittees and member assignments it should also be feasible to eliminate the practice of proxy voting now some democrats argue that proxy voting is more efficient since it does not require the presence of members for their votes to be recorded on amendments and reporting bills but it is clearly an efficiency that runs directly contrary to deliberative and participatory democracy and certainly contradictory to a members constitutional obligation to responsibly represent his or her constituents because by giving away a proxy vote members do not know what specific amendments will be offered or hear the arguments for or against them when they entrust their proxy to another member and the resulting decisions will not necessarily reflect the true sentiments of a committee majority and the constituents they represent by the same token onethird committee quorums for amending bills and a new rule allowing socalled rolling quorums for reporting them whereby members can drop by and vote after the deliberative process is completed are absolutely contrary to majority rule and deliberative decision making e h4545 the principle for committee action enunciated by jefferson in his manual should apply with the same force today as it did in his tire and that is that a majority of the committee constitutes a quorum for business they can only act when together and not by separate consultation and consentabsolutely nothing being in the report of the committee but what has been agreed to in committee actually assembled and members when one looks at the waywe handle major legislation on the house floor we are again confronted with a system that increasingly embraces undemocratic procedures in the name of efficiency at the expense of deliberative and representative government in this congress 80 percent of the bills brought through the rules committee have been considered on this floor under a process that restricts the full and free right of members to offer amendments the survey of house members taken for the joint committee reveals that this is not merely a complaint or concern of the minority party it is a very legitimate concern when house members were asked whether they agree or disagree that there have been too many limitations on debates and amendments on the house floor this year 68 percent of the respondents agreed including 41 percent of the democrats and 98 percent of the republicans it is ironic but sadly true that the inefficiencies of our current committee system are being compensated for by an overly efficient house floor system that reduces rather than improves our chances of improving upon the legislative products of those committees is it any wonder the people have less respect for the laws we enact when they see how undemocratically we conduct our business around here we have squeezed out representative and deliberative democracy at both ends of the process through a combination of inefficiency and efficiency both the committee process and the house floor process have increasingly denied us the opportunity to be representative and responsive legislators in conclusion i must respectfully disagree with my colleague from washington on both of his charges that the joint committee never had any agreed upon goals and that the goals of reformers are contradictory the recommendations of the joint committee while not going far enough reflect the consensus not only of the joint committee members but of other house members who testified and responded to the member survey and that consensus is that the existing legislative structure and process are not sufficiently rational responsive representative or deliberative members are being asked to do n we than they can responsibly and c scientiously manage at the committee level and then are being prevented from doing what they were elected to do when a bill reaches the house floor there are reforms that can be instituted that are both internally consistent and which promote the fulfillment of those goals we can again make the committee system a more efficient and participatory policy process and if committees once again produce legislation that is more representative and responsive to problems and our constituents we have less to fear about an open amendment process on the house floor as with any genuine and bold reform effort the major obstacle to its success is the resistance of some powerful members who are wedded to the status quo out of personal power considerations in clear defiance of what is in the best interests of improving the organization and operation of the institution as a whole in the meantime public respect confidence and job approval ratings of the congress continue to decline to dangerously low levels the question confronting us is whether we will have the courage and foresight to reform ourselves now in a rational way before this tidal wave of sentiment engulfs us and imposes on us more extreme and irrational changes we must act now to bring the rec ommendations of the joint committee on congressional reform to the house floor as a single bill and consider them under an open amendment process that will enable us to further strengthen them and make the changes that are necessary in our organization and operations time is running out at this time i want

just given by my friend the gentleman from florida the president should appeal that decision last week i was one of just 21 members of my party to vote against the legislative appropriations bill that was considered on the floor of this house why did i do that there were two reasons first i do not believe that bill cuts spending nearly enough yes it cuts some spending it outs some spending over in the gao and it cuts some spending in some special committees that no longer exist but it did not cut into the real waste of the legislative branch and that is the committee staff which is far too large two months ago i was one of just three members of my party who voted for a republican proposal that would have cut committee staff by 25 percent across the board that is what i think serious spending cuts should be the second reason i voted against that bill was simply this we need to restore our credibility with the american people now even a 25percent cut in congressional committee staff spending would not approach eliminating the federal budget deficit but it might help us eliminate some of the cynicism and some of the skepticism that are all too pervasive throughout america i know that every time i stand before my constituents in florida when they look at me even though i have been here just 2 years and a few months they see before them the personification of the federal government they see before them all the lies and all the deception of all the recent years watergate vietnam iran contra name your scandal name your poison name your excuse for not believing that the choices we face as a nation truly are difficult we have been lied to and deceived for far too long we have had politicians in positions of public responsibility democrats and republicans alike tell the people that the hard choices are not really necessary they say we can eliminate the federal budget deficit just by eliminating foreign aid or maybe my salary which by the way i voted to freeze a few months ago they say that the choices are really easy they are not hard at all they have been told there is some separate category of federal spending called fraud and waste that we could just cut that and eliminate the budget deficit while not eliminating programs that people need and want and deserve that is not true hard choices must be made and we are in fact beginning to make them at long last but much more must be done to restore our credibility with the people or they simply will not believe us when we tell them that the choices are hard and that they too will have to share the sacrifice of course if we ask them to sacrifice then we should sacrifice first by beginning to cut committee staff here in the congress we should do much more i am cosponsor of the bill that would impose upon the congress the same laws that we impose on everyone else i am a cosponsor in the house along with my friend the gentleman from new jersey of the revolving door bill which would keep us from using this congress as a way station on the way to becoming lobbyists for domestic interests or foreign governments i am a cosponsor of the sunshine bill the government in the sunshine bill that would keep the committee on ways and means and other committees from closing their doors on deliberations to the people and the press which i think is grievously wrong i have introduced a bill that would demand full financial disclosure from all members of this congress the same kind of disclosure that i have made voluntarily tax returns net worth statements down to the last penny filed annually

deals with the most pressing issue facing states and local governments today that is beginning the issue of unfunded mandates as many of us know today has been designated as national unfunded mandate day a day in which local officials across the country were to begin educating the public of the devastating consequences of unfunded federal mandates i was told by the unitedstates conference of mayors which was the primary sponsor of the national unfunded mandate day that over 1 000 local officials around the nation held events in which they singled out unfunded federal mandates as the biggest problem they face in these communities the message to the congress was clear stop approving legislation that imposes requirements on local governments without containing the resources necessary to carry out that mandate this august i and a number of members of congress have formed the congressional caucus on unfunded mandates in order to bring together members of congress who agree that this body must honestly address this issue since august we have 84 members of the congress who have joined the caucus on unfunded mandates as anybody who knows me can attest i am not a frequent participant in special orders however i feel that this issue is so important to our nation that it deserves the topic of discussion on the house floor in addition i feel that a special order devoted solely to unfunded federal mandates is appropriate activity for national unfunded mandate day i am proud to join with my colleagues and local government across this country to try to educate congress and the american people about unfunded mandates unfunded mandates is what we call in the business feel good legislation that is where we in congress get to feel good and pass the cost on to local governments we have got to put a stop to that there are a group of members of congress who have come together to try to find a bipartisan solution this is a bipartisan issue democrats and republicans have come together to try to come to a consensus about how we deal with the unfunded federal mandate issue and we do have limited time this evening i would like to share with my colleagues some profiles of cities that are being adversely affected by unfunded federal mandates for instance the city of phoenix az could provide substantially lower water and sewer rates to its citizens if they did not have to commit much of their local revenue to unfunded mandates in fresno ca the city estimated the costs of closing a landfill without federal mandates to be 10 to 12 million however because the landfill is included as a supedund site the cost of closing the facility will range from 35 to 60 million you should note that all of the costs will be borne by the citys solid waste rate payers in los angeles unfunded mandates will have a detrimental impact on the citys ability to provide essential swvices mayor richard riordan has told me that he could put many more cops on the streets if the city did not have to comply with so many unfunded federal mandates in philadelphia an environmental protection agency requirement that the city develop an advanced wastewater treatment system to inprove the oxygen levels for fish in the delaware water basin will cost philadelphia upwards of 500 million the mayor of philadelphia ed rendell has told me that he will not comply with this mandate because there is no way that he can justify this expenditure to the citizens of philadelphia merced ca located in my congressional district will incur 1 4 million in unfunded federal mandates in 199394 in order to balance this years budget merced had to cut over 30 staff positions remember merced only has a population of 53 000 people and it is suffering in the worst sort of way because of unfunded federal mandates in modesto ca also in my congressional district the city will spend 5 8 million on nine federal mandates over the next 6 years this money could be used to hire 150 police officers in stockton ca the san joaquin county district attorney was contemplating laying off onequarter of his prosecutors because of unfunded mandates however a temporary extension of the 1cent sales tax surcharge allowed the county to retain its prosecutors nevertheless if a permanent solution is not found the da will be forced to let these prosecutors go thus leaving the citizens of san joaquin county unprotected from crime in california the classic example of an unfunded federal mandate is immigration our immigration policy is solely the province of the federal government congress and the administration determine who may enter this country and to a great extent they determine where these immigrants reside however the state of california and its counties are responsible for the education health and welfare of these people for this year governor wilson has stated that providing social services to these people will cost the state at least 1 4 billion it should be clear to those listening to this debate that unfunded federal mandates are a problem what can we do in congress to mitigate the problems of unfunded federal mandates well we can prevent future unfunded federal mandates from being enacted since last year i have tried to offer floor amendments to any legislation considered by the house that contains unfunded mandates last congress the house considered the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 this legislation mandated that states and local jurisdictions containing large minorty populations print voting materials in the native language of those groups this mandate will no doubt increase the normal costs of running elections when the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 was considered on the house floor i offered an amendment that would have required the federal government to reimburse local governments for the increased costs due to this mandate unfortunately my amendment was defeated by two votes this congress i wanted to offer a similar amendment to the national voter registration act more commonly referred to as motorvoter it was estimated that motorvoter would cost my state of califomia 26 million a year the congressional budget office estimated the cost of compliance for all of the states to be 200 million unfortunately the rules committee did not allow my amendment to be offered and the congress went ahead and pushed another unfunded mandate onto the states last week i along with congressman goodling offered an amendment to the education goals 2000 that clarified that the bill would not become an unfunded mandate on states and school districts i am proud that our amendment was unanimously approved by the full house it is my full intention to continue offering these sorts of amendments to unfunded mandates that make their way to th house floor i would appreciate the assistance of my colleagues in this endeavor besides offering floor amendments i believe that this body needs to consider specific mandate relief legislation to that end i dave introduced h r 140 the federal mandate relief act of 1993 my bill is very simple it merely states that compliance with or implementation of an unfunded federal mandate is voluntary for states and localities until the federal govemiment provides the funding needed to pay for the mandated requirements the bill is not retroactive and would only apply to mandates which take effect on or after the date of enactment by requiring the federal government to put up the money before it can enforce any future mandates my bill accomplishes exactly what local governments are requesting that is why h r 140 has been endorsed by the unitedstates conference of mayors the national association of counties the national league of cites the national association of towns and townships the national conference of state legislatures the council of state governments and the national taxpayers union currently h r 140 enjoys the support of 108 members of congress i hope that my colleagues who are not cosponsors of h r 140 will take a look at the legislation and consider adding their names as cosponsors"], [0.9925702032633126, 0.007429796736687422,

000yearold civil war in what was the former yugoslavia as we consider this as a congress and as a nation i think it is important that we consider it very soberly and consider the implications blueprint to lead us into this postcoldwar era a blueprint that has been used repeatedly over and over by our great military leaders since that time let me quote from that speech i believe the postwar period has taught us several lessons and from them i have developed six major tests to be applied when we are weighing the use of unitedstates combat forces abroad let me now share them with you first the united states should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest or that of our allies that emphatically does not mean that we should declare beforehand as we did with korea in 1950 that a particular area is outside our strategic perimeter second if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a given situation we should do so wholeheartediy and with the clear intention of winning if we are unwilling to commit the forces or resources necessary to achieve our objectives we should not commit them at all of course if the particular situation requires only limited force to win our objectives then we should not hesitate to commit forces sized accordingly when hitler broke treaties and remilitarized the rhineland small combat forces then could perhaps have prevented the holocaust of world war ii third if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas we should have clearly defined political and military objectives and we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives and we should have andsend the forces needed to do just that as clausewitz wrote no one starts a war or rather no one in his senses ought to do sowithout first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it war may be different today than in clausewltzs time but the need for welldefined objectives and a consistent strategy is still essential if we determine that a combat mission has become necessary for our vital national interests then we must send forces capable to do the joband not assign a combat mission to a force configured for peacekeeping fourth the relationship between our objectives and the forces we have committedtheir size composition and dispositionmust be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary conditions and objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict when they do change then so must our combat requirements we must continuously keep as a beacon light before us the basic questions is this conflict in our national interest does our national interest require us to fight to use force of arms if the answers are yes then we must win if the answers are no then we should not be in combat fifth before the unitedstates commits combat forces abroad there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the american people and their elected representatives in congress this support cannot be achieved unless we are candid in making clear the threats we face the support cannot be sustained without continuing and close consultation we cannot fight a battle with the congress at home while asking our troops to win a war overseas or as in the case of vietnam in effect asking our troops not to win but just to be there finally the commitment of unitedstates forces to combat should be a last resort as we as a nation consider this weighty decision i think that we must reflect back on these questions asked by secretary weinberger and also ask ourselves is this a fight we are willing to go to the finish i do not think so i hope that the carnage of the last weekend the tremendous emotional appeal and the desire of every honorable person in the world to do something about this does not cause us to act imprudently i fear that the bosnian crisis is

that the house is considering legislation that will designate the weeks of june 6 1993 and june 5 1994 as lyme disease awareness week the senate approved identical legislation introduced by senator joseph lieberman of connecticut on march 26 1993 i appreciate this opportunity to provide my colleagues with some background on this disease and why the designation of this week is so important lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread by the deer tick which is slightly smaller than the dog tick although lyme disease was first officially reported lust 18 years ago in lyme connecticut it has fast become the most common tickbome disease and one of the fastest spreading infectious diseases in the united states once considered to be a regional problem found in the northeast 49 of the 50 states have now reported cases of lyme disease the deer tick lives in grasses along the shore in fields and at the edge of woodlands many people on eastern long island have expressed concern about going to the beach taking a walk in the woods or sitting in their own backyard for fear of getting this debilitating disease many people never even know that they have been bitten by a tick the parasite can attach itself feed detach itself and lay its eggs all without the hosts knowledge in addition due to its ability to mimic the symptoms of other ailments a person may be left clueless as to the cause of his or her ailment lyme disease is often mistaken for other illnesses such as ringworm influenza arthritis or heart disease however if left untreated lyme disease can cause partial facial paralysis meningitis encephalitis and abnormal slowing of the heartbeat severe headaches and depression destructive arthritis memory loss and chronic fatigue as early treatment of lyme disease is the key to warding off its worst effects and as there is currently no vaccine for lyme disease the best defense against it is prevention that is why education is vital if we are to minimize the effects of this painful disease the american public must know what to look for if they are to take precaution against this disease symptoms of lyme disease in its eariy stages include a characteristic rash at the site of the tick bite headaches fever pains in joints and swollen glands however a person might not develop the telltale rash at the site of the tickbite leaving the person puzzled as to the cause of such a rash moreover standard blood tests often do not reveal the presence of lyme disease the key words in combating lyme disease are protect and check protect meaning to protect yourself by wearing protective clothing and repellents and check meaning check yourself your children and your pets as soon as you get home checking is important because most experts believe the tick must be attached for more than 24 hours to transmit the disease in addition i am pleased to announce that a permethrlnbased repellent which has been approved by the environmental protection agency epa is now available to the public this spray must be used only on clothing not on the skin the spray used in combination with a longacting deetbased lotion on the skin can provide very effective protection against the tick and lyme disease mr speaker the prevention of lyme disease depends upon public awareness i want to thank my colleagues for their support in bringing this disease to the attention of the american public it is my hope that the designation of the weeks of june 6 1993 and june 5 1994 as lyre disease awareness week will help to make the general public and health care

greater respect for basic individual freedoms we remain extremely concerned about the future of political prisoners in china we are troubled by the use of prison labor we abhor chinas persecution of

liberalization that leads to further democratization we care about china playing a helpful role in cambodia we care about using chinas influence with north korea to halt pyongyangs rush to nuclear weapons we care about chinese missile technology transfers to syria iran and pakistan and we care about china playing a constructive role on the u n security council the real question is whether we

policymakers to defining in advance the objectives of unitedstates involvement in u n military operations abroad in a broader context the debate over somalia symbolizes the historic american ambivalence about entanglement in the world beyond our borders whether that engagement relates to multilateral cooperation on international security issues or the economic interdependency inherent in unitedstates participation in international economic agreements and institutions at the outset let me deal with the more poignant and urgent problem of united states military involvement in somalia the original bush administration mission was unprecedented in its idealism the humanitarian commitment of unitedstates armed forces of the united states to feeding a starving population beginning in january 1992 with the adoption of u n security council resolution 733 the united nations began actively addressing the humanitarian crisis in somalia consistent with the humanitarian impulses of our citizens and the best traditions of american foreign policy the united states actively assisted the united nations effort to deal with a serious human catastrophe the united states provided food aid as well as joined in a military airliftoperation provide relief to bring critical nourishment into the heart of the country nevertheless by december of last year over 300 000 somalis had died of starvation in addition five times that number were believed to be at risk outside the reach of international relief efforts because of the ongoing civil conflict therefore in november 1992 the united states supported u n security council resolution 794 which authorized member states to use all necessary means to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in somalia president bush judged that the deployment of unitedstates armed forces was necessary to avert a major humanitarian calamity avert related threats to international peace and security and protect the safety of americans and others engaged in relief operations on december 8 1992 united states armed forces entered somalia to secure the airfield and port facility of mogadishu and to achieve the objectives of u n security council resolution 794 the unitedstates initially encountered little organized resistance as president bush stated in december of last year unitedstates armed forces will remain in somalia only so long as necessary to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations and will then turn over the responsibility of maintaining this environment to a unitedstates peacekeeping force assigned to somalia in other words the mission of the military was to provide security to allow the delivery of food about 26 000 united states troops were deployed in somalia for operation restore hope those forces augmented by 13 000 troops from other countries operated under the unitedstates led unified task force or unitaf unitafs strictly humanitarian mission was largely successful enough civil order was established to permit international aid workers to distribute food to all but a few of the most at risk in somalia markets reopened and crops were planted according to secretary of defense aspin by the spring of 1993 chaos and banditry throughout much of somalia had been greatly reduced in addition this spring a u n led process of national reconciliation appeared to gain the support of a broad spectrum of somali leaders in march 1993 under the socalled addis ababa accords somali leaders appeared to be observing a ceasefire and had committed themselves to complete disarmament under the strictly humanitarian mission laid out by president bush the united states should have withdrawn its armed forces from somalia in late february or march 1993 instead the mission changed by american troops remained the clinton administration determined that success could only be declared and american troops completely withdrawn when we institutionalized the gains i e restored enough civil order and built a governing structure to prevent the county from backsliding into the chaos that cause the famine in the first place thus the new administration supported u n security council resolution 814 passed in late march of this year this unprecedentedly ambitious operationknown as unosom iicalled for the u n not only to continue its humanitarian work but to rehabilitate their political institutions and economy promote political settlement and national reconciliation and develop an adequate system of justice and police to maintain order as agreed the unitedstates quickly reduced its group levels from more than 25 000 to 4 000 only then did congress act in may of this year the congress not only gave belated authorization to the president to use unitedstates armed forces to implement u n security council resolution 794 of december 1992 but also similar authorization to the president to implement security council resolution 814 the legislation constitutes specific authority for military operations in the event of hostilities under section 5 b of the war powers act the authorization for unitedstates military participation in unosom ii expires in late march 1994 somalia represents the first united nationsled multinational peace enforcement mission under the terms of unitedstates participation in unosom ii about 28 000 troops from 27 countries operating under u n command were authorized to be deployed throughout somalia theunited states agreed to provide troops for logistic support and contribute about 4 000 troops for a quick reaction force the unitedstates quick reaction force not under u n command was tasked to support unosom ii missions the command and control structure established for unosom ii placed an american retired unitedstates adm jonathan howe in overall command of the u n operation as special representative of the u n secretary general admiral howe was to coordinate all nonmilitary aspects of unosom ii the unosom ii forces are commanded by turkish gen cevik bir gen bir had worked with joint chiefs of staff chairman gen colin powell in nato and was general powells top choice for the position of unosom ii commander unitedstates maj gen thomas montgomery is the deputy commander of the u n forces general montgomery commands the unitedstates logistic support contingent participating in unosom ii as well as the unitedstates quick reaction force here it is key to note that operational command and control of the unitedstates quick reaction force has been placed solely under the authority ofgeneral montgomery who reports through the joint chiefs of staff structure to the commanderinchief in washington the clinton administration admitted that the process of nation building would take time and require a combination of diplomacy and force the undersecretary of state for political affairs peter tamoff testified late this july before the senate foreign relations committee that for unosom ii to accomplish its mission a secure environment must be restoredrequiring if necessary the forceful disarmament of all factional militias in this context things began to go awry on june 5 somali militia forces loyal to mohammad farah aideed brutally attacked paldstani peacekeepers in mogadu kln 23 palkstant soldiers and wounding 3 america aocording to the clinton administration the attack on june 5 represented a lundamental challenge to unosoms mandate to provide humanitarian assistance and foster reconclation the means by which political reconciliation was evidently to be achieved was by a de facto unitedstates and u n declaration of war against aideed on june 6 the u n security council unanimously adopted resolution 837 which authorized the u n to take all necessary measures against those responsible for attacks against unosom including their arrest detention trail and punishment on june 16 the overall u n commander admiral howe declared aldeed to be a criminal and placed a public price on his head unitedstates ambassador to the u n madaeleine k albright branded aideed a thug and the state department coordinator on somalia affirmed that aldeed should be removed from the equation indeed in august the clinton administration dispatched 400 elite army rangers to somalia with the understood if undeclaredmission of neutralizing aideed for the administration from an intelligence perspective to think it has command of the situation in mogadishu is troubling for the administration to think that special operations assaults are either effective or likely to win the hearts and minds of the citizenryin an operation which by its very nature must place heavy emphasis on civic actionis foolhardy only now are the american people beginning to understand that under unosom ii the mission became something very diferen from urgent and temporary humanitarian relief the military effort to impose order on a fractious and often very violent population of a country enmeshed in fundamental nationbuilding the seuity function for achieving the original shortterm humanitarian mission was accomplished establishing security has not yet and possibly cannot be aomplished wihout unacceptable cost under the second mission because the fundamental object to be achieved involves not relief but the distribution of power within a civil conflict over who governs somalia in his speech before the u n general assembly on september 27 president clinton asserted that lithe american people are to say yes to u n peacekeeping the united nations must know when to say no that is wise and sound advice advice which unfortunately the president himself forgot to observe earlier this year with regard to somalia contrary to what the administration now appears to be saying the united nations did not change its mission over the objection of the united states we are the most important voice within the u n security council no plan was likely to proceed over our informal objections as a per anent momber we have the veto whh we apparently never contemplated exercising in this circumstance in fact the cl nton administration fully supported the resolutions authorizing unosom 1i as well as the capture of the warlord aideed i believe the administration would be well advised to shift gears and order a rapid ordedy withdrawal of unitedstates combat forces as contempated under the gilman amendment our primary humanitarian mission has at least in the short tann been met it is for the people of somalia to resolve their own nationbuilding challenges reliance on the united states or any other countries for internal security is likely to be counterproductive nations are built by citizens not foreign nationals to the degree other parties may be relevant in this task the organization of african unity probably has more to offer than the united nations or any nationstate including the united states the unitedstates role should be that of the original mission the provision of food and the utilization of our good offices for diplomatic give and take it would be better in todays context to ask a retired soldier gen colin powell to serve as a diplomatic emssa than to call on young american servicemen to fight in a quascivil war setting for an undefined uncompelng cause instead the news of the past few months is that troops were sent to defend troops that escalation was the answer to problems associated with civilian leaders who sadler blocked armored protection for troops in the field is there no sense that lives are more important than pride that hearts and souls arent likely to be won over by air power is there no sense that public support for peace enforbement in more critical gaopolitical settings than somalia is jeopardized by the false priority given multinational operations in somalia by falling to apply intellectual rigor to our somalia policy the administration is responsible for a policy that lacks persuasiveness to the american public and convincingness to peoples of the world above anything else somalia symbolizes a want of intellectual dipln our military hasnt let us down political leadership has it dces no good to blame the united nations we led it more than it misled us this is a time for responsibility taking not bame shifing it is important to recognize is circumstance otherwise peacekeeping peacemaking and enforcement as well as multilateral approaches to other problems in other countries at other times will be foiled before they are undertaken in a broader context however the compelling and often tragic news of recent weeks from moscow mogadishu sarajevo andin the context of debate over the north american free trade agreement nafta and open multilateral tadethe union halls of san francisco underscores the emergence of a profound debate in this country about the nature of the unfolding postcold war world and american national purpose wil the postcold war world be hallmarked by a strengthening of the bonds of international society or a disintegration of those bonds within and between nationstates will america drift into selfcentered isolationism as in the disastrous interwar era of the 1920s or lead in expanding an open world economy and institutionalizing a civil internaorn society from which all countries derive benefh the answer i fear is in some doubt after having aggresshely promoted a foreign policy doctrine of assertive multilateralism the president has been placed on the defensive by those who aliags that american foreign policy is incmreasingty divorced from the national interest and in a sovereignty context is ceding its foreign policy dedalorrmuldng to a foreign bureaucrat the u n secretarygeneral ukewise on intemational economic issues the president has largely ceded the rhetorical initialive to economic nationalist opponents of nafta the faiure of which could be catastrophic for the still uncompleted uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gati and the future of the world tradling system itself yet despite the wrenching difficulties in somaka and the intractable and bloody welter in the balkans the end of the cold war has created the most propitious moment since 1945 for a unitedstates led u n to fashion common responses to the common problems of mankind the manifest limits of american power and the contrasting global reach of american interests make multilateral cooperation and burdensharing imperative they make unitedstates leadership in an effective united nations essential with regard to international security the american people are reluctant to assume the lonely and costly role of policeman of the world on the other hand they are willing to accept as a collective responsibility the obligation together with other countries to part of an internatlonal highway patrol but the key to unitedstates military participation in u n collective security endeavors is a compelling and clear mission and operational effectiveness with the distinction between traditional peacekeeping and peace enforcementas well as between intemational and cmi confict becoming ever more opaque clarity of mission and professlonalization of u n collective security operations becomes ever more crucial thus as the unitedstates comnission on improving the effectiveness of the u n which i cochaired recently recommended in its final report when sending blue helmets into action the united nations should be guided by clear standards only under the most extraordinary circumstances should operations be launched if these standards are not met in addition operations that do not have a high probability of success should not be sanctioned the united nations cannot afford to support missions that will fail because their mandate is politically weak or operationally unfeasible for peace enforcement operations like unosom ii in somalia where all nonviolent policy means have failed the comrission recommended the application of the following standards which in retrospect might have averted tragedy if followed by the current administration a dear and unambiguous mandate must be expressed in the security council and widely supported in the international community generally that u n intervention is called for and that the u n is capable of making a constructive contribution to the preservation or restoration of peace and security the purpose of the action its duration and conditions and rules of engagement must be carefully defined with costs projected n advance by credible professional experts the mandate of the force should be broad enough to allow a full range of operations within a specified geographic area in pursuit of the forces objectives the intervention of the force should came at a critical juncture where the prospect of stabilizing an area politically and economically for the long term exists hence it is key that the clinton administration understand that there are times and places where u n sanctioned and u n led peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations is appropriate and that the unitedstates should be prepared where missions are compelling and welldefined to play a role the time and the place however is not now not in somalia likewise the administration should not capitulate to the narrow insular nationalism that appears to be stalking the land isolationism and belligerent naysaying is not a realistic prescription for the advancement of american national interests to default leadership in the worlds principal arena of multilateral diplomacy amounts to strategic retreat in the twilight of the 20th century nothing is more naive than to suggest that the unitedstates national interest should rely on the advancement of a narrow nationalistic foreign policy with the health of the american and worid economy dependent on open markets and free trade with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and with ethnic religious and racial divisions rising in the geographic cockpits of historic conflict unitedstates national purpose cannot afford to be diverted by ideological posturing or rudderless meandering diplomacy in america in particular there is no place for selfcentered isolationism or uncertain international leadership the stakes are too high"]]}
