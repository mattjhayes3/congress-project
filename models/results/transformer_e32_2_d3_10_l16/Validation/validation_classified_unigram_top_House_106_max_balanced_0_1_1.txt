fund congress and the president have come upon the historic opportunity to balance the budget without spending one penny of seniors social security trust fund for nearly 4 decades the raid on social security has gone on taking over 850 billion in social security funds and spending them on unrelated government programs 168 days ago just over 5 months this house passed my social security lockbox legislation by an overwhelming 416 to 12 vote the passage of this social security lockbox legislation showed that house republicans and democrats agree that social security dollars should not be spent on programs unrelated to social security congress made the commitment to stop the raid on social security shortly later however president clinton joined our bipartisan effort and committed the administration to protecting social security that was over 5 months ago unfortunatelyv i am afraid today is a different story while house republicans are continuing to honor our steadfast commitment to protect seniors social security i have great concerns about the recent actions of the clintongore white house and congressional democrats the current budget situation requires that every increase in spending be offset currently if spending is not offset it is drawn directly from seniors social security dollars over the past few weeks president clinton has vetoed five appropriations bills because he says they do not spend enough yet the president has not offered a single solid proposal to pay for those spending increases it appears the president may be willing to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do not believe the federal government can tighten its belt by just 1 percent but the american people know the truth a recent poll conducted by the national taxpayers union revealed let me show my colleagues this poll revealed that over 84 percent of americans believe that there is not just 1 percent waste in government but they felt there was at least 5 percent of waste in unneeded spending in the federal spending surely if 84 percent of the american people believe that there is at least 5 percent of waste the president and the congress can work together to find just 1 percent or one penny of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the federal government the national park service spent 1 million to build an outhouse at glacier national park in montana the expense was explained by the outhouses remote location the outhouse is located nearly 7 miles from the nearest road and it took hundreds of horse trips and more than 800 helicopter drops to get the construction materials to the site another one erroneous medicare payments that waste over 20 billion annually another the department of education maintains a 725 million slush fund which it cannot account for the department of housing and urban development hud estimated it spent 857 million in 1998 in erroneous rent subsidy payments in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the federal government we are all in this together we want to work with the president and vice president gore to find this 1 percent so that we can protect social security dollars we will not however under any circumstances allow the clintongore administration to dip into the social security trust fund to pay for more government spending with that i yield to the gentleman from arizona who serves with me on the committee on ways and means which has jurisdiction over social security"], [0.007873849011957645, 0.007873849011957645, 0, "this year house republicans have several goals we want to strengthen and make our schools safef we want to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us make the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the centerpiece of this years tax cut"], [0.00804854929447174, 0.00804854929447174, 0, "over the last several years we have asked a pretty fundamental question and that is is it right is it fair under our tax code a married working couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes vote i invite every democrat to join with republicans let us vote to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i ask for an aye

the common concerns are pretty simple that folks want us to work together they want us to solve our challenges they want us to find solutions and they want us to change how washington works as i look back over the last 5 years i am pleased that we have worked to find those solutions solutions to the challenges today of balancing the budget of cutting taxes and reforming our welfare system and we did change how washington works as i look back over the last 5 years i am proud to say that we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years 3 years ago we are now working on our third balanced budget in a row we did such a great job that now we have all this extra money of three trillion surplus dollars projected over the next 10 years we cut taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years and three million illinois children are going to benefit from the 500 per child tax credit we reformed welfare for the first time in a generation i am proud to say that in illinois the welfare roles have been cut in half in my home county of grundy our welfare roles have dropped by 84 percent we also tamed the tax collector shifting the burden of proof off the backs of the taxpayer and onto the irs those are fundamental changes balancing the budget cutting taxes reforming our welfare system and taming the tax collector people often say well what is next what other solutions is congress going to find to the challenges that we face our agenda is simple we want to strengthen our local schools we want to lower the tax burden and make it fair for working families we want to strengthen social security and medicare and we also want to pay down the national debt that was run up over 30 years of deficit spending i often hear common questions in the district i represent whether at a union hall or the vfw or the chamber of commerce or a coffee shop or a grain elevator people often say when are you folks in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i am proud to say this republican congress is putting a stop to that in fact this year we are walling off the social security trust fund setting aside a hundred percent of social security for the first time in 30 years for social security only the president says he wants to set aside 62 percent we believe in a hundred percent of social security for social security that means 200 billion more to strengthen social security and medicare i am often asked people never also talk about that huge national debt that was built up over the 30 years of deficit spending beginning in the 1960s i am proud to say that under the republican balanced budget we pay down 2 2 trillion of the national debt the public debt over the next few years and that is about 200 billion more than the president would under his proposal the question that i am also often asked is when are we going to do something about the tax code people of course are fed up that 40 percent of the average familys income goes to washington and the state capital and the county courthouse and the local government and that tax burden is the highest in peacetime history but they are also frustrated about the complexity of our tax code and the unfairness of our tax code over the last couple of years i have often asked this question in the well of the house and that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes a husband andwife who are both in the workforce pay more in taxes than an identical couple that live outside of the marriage is it right is it fair that under our tax code that 21 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not it is wrong that under our tax code that 21 million married working couples pay 1 400 more just because they are married i have a photo here of a young couple in joliet illinois one of the communities that i represent michelle and shad hallihan they are public school teachers in the joliet public school system they just had a baby they are celebrating the birth of a child they suffer the marriage tax penalty because they are both in the workforce and under our tax code this young couple who just had a baby who is just starting their life together as a family pays higher taxes just because they chose to get married now had they chose to live together outside of marriage they would not pay those higher taxes i am proud to say the house and senate passed legislation which will eliminate the marriage tax penalty for the majority of those who suffer it it is a key part it is an essential part of the financial freedom act legislation that will lower the tax burden as well as simplify the tax code and bring fairness to the tax code the question of the day is mr president are you going to join with us eliminating the marriage tax penalty to help hardworking young americans actually americans of every age because seniors suffer the marriage tax penalty but people like michelle and shad hallihan who suffer the marriage tax penalty our legislation eliminates the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those who suffer it it should be a bipartisan effort we

save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment

an average of 1 400 per year more in taxes than they would pay if they are unmarried this burdensome tax is especially unfair to working women whose income is often cut in half by the higher tax rates caused by the marriage penalty under the current tax code a married couple pays more taxes by filing jointly than they would if each spouse filed as a single person the marriage tax penalty exists because the standard deduction for couples 7 350 is 1 450 less than double the standard deduction for singles 4 400 4 400 = 8 800 in essence the tax code punishes millions of couples by pushing them into higher tax brackets the marriage penalty taxes the income of the second wage earner often the wifes salaryat a much higher rate than if the salary were taxed only as an individual for example an individual earning 30 500 would be taxed at 15 percent but a working couple with incomes of 30 500 each are taxed at 28 percent on their combined income of 61 000costing the couple almost 1 400 more

to twice that of single returns and raise the phaseout limit on the earned income tax credit eitc by 2 000 for married couples the increase in the standard deduction and the increased phaseout limit for the eitc would be effective next year the increase in the 15 tax bracket would be phased in over 6 years starting in 2003 furthermore h r 6 helps both families who itemize their deductions like

could not do we were told we could not balance the budget we were told we could not balance the budget and lower taxes we were told we could never reform our welfare system but we did i am proud to say in the last 4 years t jiat we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years producing a projected 2 8 trillion surplus of extra tax revenues we lowered taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years and 3 million illinois children now qualify for the 500 per child tax credit back home in my state of illinois that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming

accomplishments but what is next on congress agenda we are working to continue responding to the issues and concerns of the folks back home and we have a simple agenda in this congress the republican agenda is simple good schools low taxes and a secure retirement for all america and our budget that were working on today reflects that i am often asked some questions in town meetings back home one of the most important ones we addressed this year i am often asked by folks whether at a senior citizens center a union hall or a vfw when are the politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund that is a pretty important basic question of course washington has raided the social security trust fund for over 30 years back when lbj was president washington began that process and bad habits are hard to break i am proud to say this republican congress is going to lock away 100 percent of social security revenues for social security only let me point out here what this means and i will compare the republican budget with the clintongore budget on social security the republican budget of course locks away 100 percent of social security for social security i would point out that 137 billion of the social security surplus under our lockbox will stay in social security now the president talks about 62 percent of the surplus for social security and what the president and vice president gore are talking about doing is spending 38 percent of social security on othei things that is what the folks back home call raiding the social security trust fund republicans say 100 percent of social security for social security clintongore they say 62 percent and spend the rest on other things we want to put a stop to that and that is why the lockbox proposal republicans are moving through the congress is so important because it is the first step we should take as we work to save social security let us lock away social security first before we consider any other reforms another question i am often asked is no one ever talks about the national debt let me point out that in this budget this year we are in a position where we are going to be able to pay down 1 8 trillion of the national debt last year we paid off 50 billion this year we are projected to pay off 100 billion of the national debt and under our budget we propose the potential of paying down 1 8 trillion of the national debt saving social security paying down the debt i am also asked at the union halls and the vfws and the other community centers and the grain elevators in the

local courthouse in taxes the tax burden today for the middle class is at its highest level ever in peacetime history twentyone percent of our gross domestic product goes to washington that is the highest level ever in peacetime history and it is putting a tremendous squeeze on middle class families i believe as we work to lower the tax burden on middle class families we should simplify the tax code we should work to bring fairness to the tax code beginning with the elimination of the marriage tax penalty it is simply wrong that under our tax code 21 million married working couples on

plan treat that money well if we look at vice president gores plan 46 cents of every surplus dollar is committed to new government spending on the contrary in the bush plan 6 cents of all surplus dollars are committed to new spending what about preserving social security medicare and paying off our national debt a lot of them serve the same purpose paying off our debt helps us preserve social security and medicare the bush plan commits 58 cents of every surplus dollar over the next 10 years toward preserving social security and paying off the debt and shoring up medicare the gore plan commits 36 cents of every surplus dollar what about tax relief this is the lowest priority in the gore budget vice president gore is saying that for every surplus dollar coming into washington americans after they overpay their taxes should only get 7 cents of that dollar back governor bush is saying 29 cents of every surplus dollar should be returned back to the taxpayer after dedicating 58 cents back towards social security and medicare and paying off the debt and increased interest costs something that we have to do to manage the interest the balance payments 11 cents for gore 7 cents for bush that basically means that the vice president is paying off debt at a slower pace the vice president if all of his new spending plans get enacted will likely wind us up into the point where we will have to dip into the social security trust fund if you want to take a look at what the difference is in plans over the surplus are just take a look at who wants to spend money and who wants to save the money vice president gore is proposing the greatest expansion of the federal government in 30 years he is proposing to take 2 1 trillion of the surplus and spend it on new programs here in washington to the contrary governor bush is saying let us spend 278 billion on needed things in washington such as committing ourselves to the fundamental problems we have in this country funding the education unfunded mandates funding our critical needs in health care rebuilding our national defenses when it comes down to it it is basically this the vice president wants to spend the surplus in washington the greatest expansion of the federal government in 30 years at the expense of social security and medicare and paying off our debt governor bush is saying this here is the priority of how we deal with the surplus pay off our national debt shore up social security and medicare and if people still continue to overpay their taxes to washington give them their money back rather than spend it on new programs in washington that is what bush is proposing and there is a huge world of difference between these two men running for president and their visions for america with respect to how they treat our surpluses"], [0.010118121281266212, 0.010118121281266212, 0, "i along with three of our other colleagues had a great hearing in minnesota today it really builds on what we have learned i think today was the 21st state that we have gone to the 23rd field hearing that we have gone to people at the local and at the state level we have asked them what is working in education and then really and we should maybe do this in future hearings to give us a grade as to how washington is either helping them or assisting them in getting them and enabling them to get done what they want to get done at the local level i think one of the witnesses that we had today i do not remember exactly which one it was maybe the gentleman from colorado does who said when one takes a look at the system that we have created here in washington of hundreds of different programs hundreds of different mandates and the number that we have heard today was we get 6 percent of the money from washington we get 70 percent of the rules and the regulations that is not outlandish i mean consistently when we go from one state to the next ohio they have documented it they said we get 7 percent of our money from washington we get 50 percent of the mandates 50 percent of the paperwork so that is consistent from all the states that we have talked to but one of the people said only you in washington could come up with a system that looks like this if you are actually focused on kids if you were focused on results which is kids learning you would have a very different set of programs and requirements only a system that is focused on process you know that this is what we want to have happen and this funding stream and a system that measures process rather than kids learning is what we have created here in washington again we heard it in minnesota today we have heard it at every single state that we have gone to that is the formula for kids learning parental involvement number one that is the key a focus on basic academics again we have got a charter school today talking traditional public schools talking about a focus on basic academics you have to provide a safe and a drugfree school you cannot have learning go on where kids are concerned about their safety or they are concerned about what their colleagues or their peers are doing in the classroom or in the hallways you have to focus on getting dollars into the classroom that consistently is the formula the gentleman from wiscqnsin is talking about we have got this program we have got that program what have we learned we learned that when one has got hundreds of education programs one has got streams of paperwork of bureaucracy that every time wisconsin michigan or minnesota sends dollars to washington for education they have got to come back to us begging to get some of their money back we then give it to them we give it to them with a whole string of mandates so they end up spending it on things they do not necessarily believe are their priorities instead of getting a dollar back for every dollar that they send here when one calculates all the paperwork all of the bureaucracy all these types of things we believe that at most they get 60 cents back maybe sometime later as we go through the process there are some other things that we can talk about we can talk about exactly how effective the bureaucracy is here in washington this is a department that now for 2 years in a row has failed its audit meaning that it cannot come back to congress it cannot come back to the american people the people that fund this agency and say we have been very careful in managing your money and we can tell you exactly where it goes we know for 2 years they failed their audit we know that for at least 3 more years they will not be able to get a clean audit we all know that in that kind of environment there have been a number of opportunities for waste fraud and abuse we can maybe outline what some of those are later on as we go through this process then we can also talk about what some of our priorities are for addressing this issue my colleagues have already mentioned one which is let us fully fund and meet the commitments that we have made to local school districts by increasing and meeting our commitment on idea we can talk about eliminating bureaucracy and red tape through the edflex program giving school districts more flexibility through the state the straight as program where we give them the money and say you decide whether you want to hire teachers train teachers reduce class size or whatever and also we want to focus on getting 95 cents of every federal education dollar into the classroom so there is a whole series of things that we can talk about as we continue through this hour i yield back to the gentleman from colorado to either build on some of these thoughts or on some other ideas that he may have"], [0.010366621427237988, 0.010366621427237988,

goal is to make the tax code fair for working families those who work hard pay their bills on time and pay their taxes on time they all tell me they pay too much in taxes but they complain even more about how unfair the tax code is that it is too complicated and that our tax code punishes marriage it punishes family it punishes those who are entrepreneurs and create small businesses clearly a decision has been made by our leadership under the leadership of our house speaker the gentleman from illinois that we are going to do something that is a good idea we are going to send to the president a standalone bill that does one thing so there are no excuses there are no excuses for bill clinton to veto this bill this time and that is we are going to send to the president legislation that will help 25 million married working couples by bringing fairness to the tax code that wipes out the marriage tax penalty the proposal we will vote on tomorrow does several things it helps those who do not itemize by doubling the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles and that will take care of about 9 million couples we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who itemize their taxes and as we all know the primary reason middleclass families itemize their taxes is because they own a home so if we want to help those other couples and we are going to help 25 million couples we have to help those who itemize those who own a home and pursue the american dream they should not have to continue paying the marriage tax penalty just because they are a homeowner that is wrong we also help those who participate in the earned income credit the working poor those who are at the edge that need a little extra help of course ronald reagan created the earned income credit program back in the mid1980s to help families that are working poor and of course want to be in the work force and be able to support their children and raise their families in a good quality of life so we wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples we help those who itemize and suffer the marriage tax penalty and we help lowincome families and under our proposal according to the joint committee on taxation the biggest beneficiaries are those with incomes between 30 000 and 75 000 in fact for a couple making 30 000 in combined income 97 percent of their federal income tax is wiped out when we wipe out their marriage tax penalty for those making 75 000 we reduce their tax burden by about 11 percent when we wipe out their marriage tax penalty i think of young couples like michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers in joliet illinois who suffer the marriage tax penalty they both teach in joliet public schools they just had a baby and they are excited about that and as michelle told me she says if we can convince the congress and the president to wipe out the marriage tax penalty what the marriage tax penalty means to couples like michelle and shad hallihan is about 3 000 diapers for their newborn child the marriage tax penalty is real money for real people it is 1 400 on average twentyfive million married working couples suffer the unfairness of the tax code when they pay 1 400 more in higher taxes in the south suburbs of illinois on the south side of chicago the area i have the privilege of representing 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet junior college the local community college it is 3 months of day care it is several months of car payments 1 400 the average working tax penalty is a significant contribution to an individuals retirement account those iras it is real money for real people tomorrow h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will be brought to the floor of this house to be debated my hope is it will pass with an overwhelming bipartisan majority it is all about fairness bringing fairness to the tax code my hope is democrats will join with republicans in wiping out the marriage tax penalty i am pleased that thanks to the leadership of my colleague and friend the gentlewoman from missouri who is our chief democratic cosponsor of h r 6 we have 30 democrats that have joined as cosponsors as part of the 241 that are in support of this bill tomorrow is a big day let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty let us bring fairness to the tax code let us have a strong bipartisan show of support

be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now i am happy to yield back to the gentleman from colorado"], [0.9814492091536522, 0.01855079084634781, 1,

when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a

gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson

stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and

there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across

either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it

something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me

"i rise in strong opposition to the kucinich amendment which would seriously undermine our efforts to promote stability and reconstruction in kosova this amendment seeks to cut off all funding for the kosova protection corps a civilian organization formed in september of last year to employ demobilized members of kosova liberation army on needed efforts such as disaster response search and rescue humanitarian assistance to isolated areas demining and rebuilding the countrys infrastructure the kpc which operates under the authority of the un offers employments to these veterans to engage in constructive activities in support of the country and its people i understand and share the gentlemans concerns over allegations of acts of violence committed by purported members of this organization these incidents should be investigated fully and those found guilty should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law but to completely cut off funding to an organization that in the words of the kfor commander general klaus reinhardt is an essential step to restoring normalcy to this region would undercut and negate everything that this country and our european allies have done to restore peace and stability to kosova jwy 13 2000 the fact is the vast majority of former kla members who joined the kpc were not professional soldiersthey were farmers laborers or mechanics individuals with skills that are desperately needed as kosova rebuilds yes they took up arms in the face of naked aggression from serb paramilitary and security forces faced with similar situations i doubt many in this chamber wouldnt do the same to protect their homes their families and loved ones the war is now over and it is essential that we support programs such as this which in a very real sense beat swords into plowshares by transitioning these veterans to the cause of community service and nation building that cause would be undercut if we allow this amendment to prevail lets not destroy a worthwhile program and jeopardize the cause of peace because of the misdeeds of a few i urge my colleagues to oppose the kucinich amendment"], [0.9734596181660891, 0.026540381833910942, 1, "i yield 30

everybodys lips but fast wanes away and that is school safety and the problem with violence in our schools in the next few days or next week we will consider gun legislation we will hear a lot of rhetoric we will talk about a lot of things but somehow with time and space we forget about the great tragedy that has happened in america in the past 2 years this year when graduation takes place many students will commence to higher education but in colorado 13 students will never go to class again in georgia only by the grace of god our students were injured and not killed does congress have a role in this is there something that we can do yes i think there is but first i think we need to be honest about the blame game there is appropriate responsibility in the gun industry and they should accept it there is appropriate responsibility in the motion picture industry and they should accept it there is appropriate responsibility in the music industry and they should accept it and every parent in americashould understand today that parental responsibility must be restored in america if we are ever to solve school violence but congress has a role too it is our fault as well we stand here today in the peoples house and appropriate money for the education of our children the defense of our country exports of our materials and facilitating our businesses yet our greatest natural resource is the generation now being educated in the schools of america should we run them no they should not be federalized i was a school board chairman in georgia i know local control is important but i know resources are equally important next week i will introduce in the congress a bill that really does address school violence it does not play the blame game by attacking an inanimate object a motion picture or music all of which have some responsibility but instead it talks about us being a facilitator for resources at the local level through a block grant program that institutionalizes in this country an expectation of safety discipline and student assistance when you read behind the sensationalism of the last few instances in america you will find students who were troubled students who were reported by teachers or other parents to have demonstrated tendencies that would be violent and you will find gaps between that report and any followup and unfortunately in each and every case whether it be paducah or jonesboro or conyers or littleton tragedy ensued and the lives of american children were lost this bill would do the following things it would create a block grant program for any system in the country that wishes to apply for us to assist in the funding of a director of school safety in every public school in america it would not allow the funds to supplant state or local funds the individual employed would not necessarily have to be a certified teacher but could be at the discretion of that system somebody that most importantly met the needs of the demographics of those children if accepted it would require a school safety plan and further it would exempt from existing law the prohibitions we now place on many teachers and administrators from direct referrals of students who demonstrated violent tendencies to the appropriate law enforcement mental health or other agency that we fund in our local governments around this country i am convinced that children rise to the expectations that we set for them unfortunately we have created an environment where our expectations in our schools in terms of discipline in terms of zero tolerance for violence are not as high as they should be and the children the vast majority almost 100 percent who are good kids who obey the rules who go to school they should not be punished and their life should never be taken because we did not do what we could do to facilitate an environment in our schools of safety and discipline and probably most importantly direct assistance when a child is in trouble to see to it they receive what they need at the most critical time in their lives i want to conclude by making a point i am a parent since i have been in politics i probably got more credit for raising our three than i deserve but my wife and i raised three wonderful children we sent them all to public schools i think that is the real world i think that is the world my kids will grow up in we sent them there and we tried our best to be involved in their education to raise their expectations to do the right thing and to obey the law there are lots of other parents like that but the biggest problem in america today is probably parental deficit disorder not attention deficit disorder we cannot expect our system to educate our kids and to raise them i urge
