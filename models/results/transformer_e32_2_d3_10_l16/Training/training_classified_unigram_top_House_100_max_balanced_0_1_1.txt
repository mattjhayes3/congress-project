speaker and my colleagues and those who are watching this memorial sala burton served in this house for 3 years her husband served for close to two decades if you look at that statistic alone it does not really tell you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the working people and the ability of those people to organize collectively to fight for their rights they always saw the people who were struggling who were having a tough time as the ones who needed their help most they cared about protecting the environment and they cared very deeply about this nation of ours sala burton was a refugee from poland she and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes at the lovely memorial service in san franscisco was given by the speaker of the state assembly another person who has gone back even longer than almost any of us who are involved in public office in his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will insert that interview into the record i think it speaks a lot about sala in ways that many people did not know about her particularly her remembrances of the holocaust and very strong feelings of

members to come to the floor under special orders to pay the first tribute to sala burton i came to the floor and i listened to what the others were saying about sala and i know each of us was so taken with our own thoughts one of the things i did i kept looking up to that area of the gallery and remembering so many times that i would look up there if there was one of phils battles on the floor a major piece of legislation that phil would be handling if it was an important moment for this house sala burton before she became a member but as phils partner would be sitting right up there i kept looking up there missing her i have to say that sala was my very dear personal friend when i heard so many members coming from all over that day on such short notice to eulogize sala and to say how much they loved her and how much they would miss her i have to say i was surprised because i thought she was just my special friend i thought that she was a political acquaintance to the other members of the house and she was a colleague to her colleagues from california but that she was my special friend i realize today that that was salas special gift that for each one of us she was our special friend she was a wonderful woman sala burton was a wonderful wife too i was fortunate enought to be a friend of both phil and sala i met phil in the late sixties here and he helped me to get legislation through this house that gave the virgin islands a seat in this house of representatives the relationship between phil and sala was such a beautiful relationship phil the stormy phil burton the great legislator the powerful individual with a heart even bigger than that huge body he had and sala that loved him that was his true partner and how he loved her too at the funeral service in san francisco there were those that recalled how sala would calm the troubled waters that phil had passed by and she had that gift we will all miss sala she was a woman of great conviction as another member just said today she was so proud of her jewishness she cared so much for the poor and for those that needed help and that was why i particularly liked both phil and sala they were legislators that cared and never forgot why they had come here when sala came into this body as an elected representative many thought perhaps that this was just sala burton the devoted wife and partner of phil coming here but she sure showed us she was a very very effective member of this house and legislator in the short period that she was here now we will miss her she was a wonderful woman she was a wonderful wife a great legislator and a great friend the sorrow of losing sala burton will be slow to pass but we can take heart knowing the inspiration of salas life and convictions also will be slow to pass her commitment to peace social justice and equality for all knew no compromise we must keep that commitment before us as we wrestle with the hard decisions that face us in this hall but salas inspiration goes far beyond the political realm as we usually know it her political beliefs crew directly out of her compassionate and caring personality it was wonderfully typical of salawhose political causes spanned continentsthat she found time to lend a hand to the small territory of the virgin islands she and her late husband phil were abiding political allies and personal friends for more than 20 years over the yearseven as they worked tirelessly for peace and civil rights and national parklands for allthey extended their concerns to the virgin islands and other offshore territories thanks to leaders like sala and phil we in the islands have won basic rights to elect our governors and gain representation in congress sala and phil had nothing to gain from this sort of

conversations on the floor of the many moving words said of sala in recent days i think that these words spoken at her memorial service in san francisco by frank kielinger gave the greatest sense of who sala and phil burton were frank kieliger worked with and for the burtons for many years i would like to insert his remarks in the record yesterday as we stood in this rotunda and watched the people of san francisco pay tribute to sala there was a moment of overpowering grief and loss and i said to my son this is the last time we will see sala later as we walked in the dark through the plaza outside this teenager said to me dad your wrong look around you well isee sala every time we see these people only she would notice we had just passed one of the confused and homeless night people and we were in sight of the tents of those seeking help for aids victims by demonstrating at the old federal building in a single sentence he had captured sala he had told me her story elie wiesel in his work souls on fire tells us of the role of story and memory in our lives he writes my father an enlightened spirit believed in man my grandfather a fervant hasid believed in god the one taught me to speak and the other to sing both loved stories and when i tell mine i hear their voices whispering from beyond the silenced storm they are what links the survivor to their memory we are here today to refresh our memories and to renew our commitments to all that sala burton represents in her life we come to share our stories of her i leave to others the task of commenting on her political prowess and her skills as a legislator the sala i knew and loved was larger then the sum of these parts 1 have asked myself over and over what made her so special and how can that specialness be expressed in brief remarks i have searched my thirty year recollection of her and what i find is a woman so secure in the knowledge of her own humanity so secure in knowledge of her own dignity and worth as a person that she would spend her life defending the dignity and worth of others sala was a woman who could talk to me when i was a young man about the worlds indifference to the approaching holocaust and of her own personal experiences of eastern european antisemitism and of fleeing poland she could do so without hate but with a fierce determination that the story be told for sala this bitter lesson of the past must be alive in our memory so that this most heinous crime against humanity can never happen again she told me the story sala was a woman who lived rather than preached the values of her jewish heritage in her struggle for peace in the world for an end to the arms race for a world freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation in her opposition to the immoral practice of hiring mercenaries by funding the contras in nicaragua there can be heard the echoes of the prophet isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and nations shall make war no more in salas ceaseless quest for a just and more humane society a society which recognizes its obligations to the poor the aged the infirmed the homeless and all who are dispossessed in this land she made tangible the words of micah you have been told 0 man what is good and what is required of you to live justly to show mercy and to walk humbly with your god for sala accidents of race color creed national origin ancestry gender or sexual orientation could never be excuses for denying the inherent dignity of the human person and her life is summed up in the struggle to make that ideal a reality it was sala who introduced me to the reality of racial discrimination and racism and who educated me and formed my conscience on these issues as she involved me in the struggle for fair employment practices and fair housing in our state so many years ago it was sala who introduced me to the concept that the magnificent document we call the constitution of the united states protects all or it protects none it was sala who opened my eyes to the dangers of mccarthyslm and to its remnants in our society as we stood in union square and listened to phil then in the assembly call for the abolition of the house committee on un american activities some of us can still remember the picture of the hoses being turned on demonstrators and the water cascading down these very stain as dedicated civil libertarians were dragged down them for protesting the presence of that comnittee in our city and sala would feel deep anger at the sight of this injustice for sala was a woman whose conscience was so finely honed whose perceptions of social justice and human rights were so clear that she was truly a woman well ahead of her time she was a pioneer ever pressing forward ever encouraging the more fainthearted of us to follow where phil would move mountains by the shear volume of his knowledge and the weight of his arguments sala would touch the heart would prick the conscience would call us to be what we can and should be concerned and caring human beings when phil might seem preoccupied or distant in his singlemindedness sala was always the embodiment of care and concern they were a unique team their lives were both public and private and it is in the private moments that their great love and respect for one another was most evident and as i say these words i can envision phil even now reaching over and grasping her hand in a gesture which in life spoke volumes they are once again together they are once again an invincible team i have spoken of the sala i know with a very special affection it was she after all who suggested to phil many years ago that he hire me on a six month trial that six months stretched into twenty five rewarding years in which i learned from them that the purpose of public life is service that power is always exercised in behalf of the powerless and that those who possess the platform for public debate have the obligation to eloquently and forcefully express the aspiration of those in our society who are voiceless that is my story of sala burton the sala i will remember every time i see the faces of the people she saw and whose dignity she defended it is my prayer that the god of abraham our god who blessed her and kept her in life who made his continence to shine upon her with a special radiance

unitedstates and haitian exile sources col jeanclaude paul commander of the powerful dessaline battalion in haitis capital has been under suspicion of drug smuggling since 1986 sources say but only recently have investigators compiled enough evidence to proceed with grandjury activity and possible indictment ile would apparently be charged with aiding the flow of colombian cocaine to the unitedstates and of arms from the unitedstates to colombia sources say some sources say an indictment is imminent but given secrecy of the process others are unsure if colonel paul is indicted the case will severely challenge haitian president leslie manigat who has pledged a crackdown on drug smugglers though unitedstates officials were unwilling to discuss the judicial investigation they said an indictment could call into question the arrangements by which mr manigat came to power if he tries to fire paul unitedstates congressional sources say that will view this as a serious litmus test of civilian control in haiti and of how the unitedstates should deal with the new regime pauls unit is viewed as the most important in the country and his troops are fiercely loyal to him unitedstates officials say this makes it very difficult for haitis president or pauls nominal military superiors to move against him wellinformed haitians say paul has warned that he will not go down alone if others try to remove him paul allegedly played a major role in directing violence that upset the november elections in haiti because of close ties to the tonton macoutes the secret police created during the duvalier dictatorship the violence and killing paved the way for manigats election last month paul is seen as very close to the gen william regala who was no 2 man in haitis transitional junta and may be named defense minister he is the muscle and regala is the brain says a haitian opposition source but paul has an independent power base since becoming commander of the dessaline barracks in early 1986 he has assiduously wooed his troopsdining with them wearing fatigues like theirs supplementing their pay with bonuses allegedly funded from drug trafficking washington sources say they will kill at his command a haitian opposition source says paul has also reportedly incorporated several thousand tonton macoutes into his unit making it even more formidable us officials say hes got all the guns one us specialist says washington first raised reports of pauls activities in the transitional haitian government in 1986 but received no satisfactory reply officials say after the initial us complaints an internal haitian military investigation was launched haitian exile sources say the final report reportedly confirmed the charges and included aerial photos of pauls farm with a private landing strip but after the army chief of staff presented it to gen henri namphy the thenacting head of government the investigating officers were reportedly transferred and accused of plotting a coup the army chief of staff and the colonel in charge of the investigation were subsequently forced to retire us officials could not confirm the haltians charges while stressing their lack of knowledge of the us judicial investigation they say earlier us intelligence indicates paul is alleged to have taken over parts of the drugtrafficking ring once reportedly run by the fatherinlaw of mr duvalier pauls brother alexander former haitian consul in miami is reported to have been in that earlier operation and the current one they say colombian cocaine and marijuana were reportedly the staples of this trade informed haitians here say that paul is well tied into the tonton macoutes in part because his father was in the personal entourage of franqois duvalier who founded the group to keep the military and opponents in line pauls reported ill deeds go beyond drugs a reuter dispatch from haiti reports that he and his two brothers arranged to receive the 4 000 tons of waste from the city of philadelphia dumped on the haitian coast line near the port of gonaives in january haiti opposition sources have provided the monitcr with what appears to be an import authorization from haitis minister of commerce for the paul brothers to import 20 million kilograms of usorigin ash free of inspection unloading of the ash stopped after local residents vigorously complained news reports from haiti indicate the waste may contain high levels of dioxin press reports say the paul brothers reportedly received 200 a ton to accept the ash washington will be watching carefully how

minister tuesday us officials an congressional activists doubt that manig can move against paul alone they also wonder if namphy and regaia have the will or courage to act against their powerful

become the indispensable arm of the communist expansion in this hemisphere i sent a message to patrick that i thought those words were too harsh i do not know whether it was 1 year ago or 6 months ago

president calls freedom fighters they are outnumbered with the military strength of the sandinistas but they are still fighting for freedom i wonder why we have become so sophisticated that we cannot recognize it that it was free dom fighters who made our own united states possible have we gone so far from our roots that we have forgotten the men and women who cre ated this great country of ours what about these americans who dumped tea into boston harbor in defiance of the british rulers what of those who fought and died at saratoga and at valley forge these were no fancy military experts but they knew if they could get their freedom they had to fight for it and that is what the contras are doing the individuals that we are proposing to cut off with this legislation what a travesty that so many members of this body should be opposing the men and women who seek freedom and who hate a cruel and ruthless dictatorship have we forgotten how our country was built the brave men and women who crossed the river delaware with general washington to put to rout the british enemy whom they had opposed they were also contras they were contra england how can we justify a vote in opposition to these nicaraguan freedom fighters how can we turn our backs to those who seek freedom who are even willing to give their lives in freedom let us remember that nicaragua is in desparate straits its inflation rate is at an astounding 13 000 percent and as the eloquent columnist of the washington post mr krauthammer said if the united states stops helping the contras she will have managed the most extraordinary self inflicted strategic surrender in memory our decline will be well earned certainly no redblooded american would want to be present at that consummation this afternoon we are debating the future of tile contras but the basic issue in this debate is what america itself is all about the opportunity of freedom over the years america has stood for freedom and thousands of people from other lands have come to america because they hated oppression one of the very first actions of the new united states of america was a proposal sponsored by our fourth president james lonroethe monroe doctrineand its impact was sweeping that we would tot permit any foreign government to eatablish itself in our hemisphere we wanted only governments that were free as we in america the issue before this free american congress today is freedom itself the nicaraguan government as everybody knows has violated that monroe doctrine a native leftwing groupthe sandinistasforcefully took over the somoza government but they only did so by promising the organization of american states that they would establish a free democratic government that would include other parties that free elections would be held and that would include persons representing all groups in the nation but those promises were quickly shoved aside and the government of the ortega boys promptly forgot their promises to the nicaraguan peopleabout freedom within a short time nicaragua has become a totalitarian communist regimea total violation of the monroe doctrine in a continent

minutes today we are without a doubt paying tribute to one of the giants in this body jack kemp has worked with us and there is no question in my mind i do not want to talk about him in the past tense because the fact is where is he going he is leaving this body but he is certainly not leaving the washington area and i think that is important i guess my relationship with him started back in 1980 during a period of time when jimmy carter was president of the united states i remember standing on this floor the governor of puerto rico has just died the exgovernor of puerto rico had just died luis m anoz marn i was here talking about the progess that puerto rico had made over the last several decades and all of a sudden this republican conservative republican i might add gets up on the other side of the aisle and starts to talk about luis munoz marin as if he was his first cousin it became very clear to me at that particular moment that jack kemps interest went far beyond his congressional district in buffalo that he knew a great deal of what was going on it was out of that discussion and on the loss of our former governor of puerto rico munoz marin that he and i established a relationship and it was from that relationship that we came up with the enterprisezone bill the enterprisezone bill was finally enacted i guess 2 years ago it came out of the housing subcommittee chaired by the distinguished gentleman from texas and we had the enterprise zones which became a reality the fact of the matter is that while we did not get the revenue part of the bill completed nonetheless 37 states across this country identified with the enterprise zones and passed their own enterprise zones i am happy to report that through the efforts of jack kemp and myself that we were able to get this bill passed and get it out but i think the history of this lesson is the following it is that jack kemp and 1 i am certain on 90 percent of the issues possibly 80 percent of the issues we disagree but when we can agree why not i remember when we first introduced a bill and i say this to my colleague from minnesota and some said well why are you doing that why are you introducing the bill with a republican i said look 2 years from now if the bill becomes law they could care less whether it is garcia whether it is kemp the bottom line is that the law is there and the people are benefiting and it was interesting that that was my feeling at that time to my republican colleagues now i want them to know the following that in 1981 after ronald reagan was elected the white house came down very hard on us to change some of the parts of the enterprisezone bill they wanted to delete the minimum wage they wanted to delete some osha regulations and jack kemp and i had a long talk about it and jack kemp said to me and i will never forget this he said we started this together we are going to finish it together and i do not care who the administration is whether it is democrat or republican that that is the way we wrote it and that is the way it is going to stay and if they change any part of it i am getting off and i know you are going to get off people do not realize that but in 1981 that was a very hard thing for a guy like jack kemp to do because of the pressures being brought upon by a firstterm president a person who came in and swept in a lot of republicans where they had control of this body and jack kemp stood tall i say that to the gentleman because i think it is important our of that relationship we were termed by some national magazines as the odd couple i guess we were the odd couple here i am a democrat a fairly liberal voting record and jack kemp a republican a fairly strong conservative record and we banded together to get the enterprise zone bill and i say that to the gentleman because there are many issues that jack and i were involved in and i think my colleague the gentleman from california is right whether it be on a question of soviet jewry whether it be on a question of immigration he was always there and another part that i always remember was during the debate on the martin luther king holiday bill it was jack kemp who led the forces on that side of the aisle to come forward and to support the martin luther king holiday and it is a reality today i find it most interesting that that is the way this congress should operate not based on partisan politics but what we consider to be right what we consider to be the right thing to do and jack kemp to me has always demonstrated that with me and i can say this to all of the members here that as a democrat i can say that jack kemp is a person that worries me a little bit because he is so good but as a friend and this is the key as a friend i am an admirer of jack kemp and i always will be i wish him well and i wish his wife well and i thank my colleague from minnesota for giving me these few minutes to say what i have to say about the odd couplebon garica and jack kemp today we are paying tribute not only to one of the giants of this body but a friend of mine jack kemp those of us who have worked with jack over the years will surely miss him that is not to say that i have always agreed with jack i havent but i have always found him to be compassionate and fair in 1980 jack and i first began work on our enterprise zone legislation that was the birth of the socalled odd couple yet i first had contact with him even before our work on enterprise zones i was speaking on the floor in tribute to munoz mann the legendary former governor of puerto rico and jack stood up and started praising him talking about operation bootstrap and all that munoz marin had done for the people of puerto rico i looked across the chamber and thought to myself who is this guy i thought he was a conservative republican what does he know about munoz marin well that was also the last time i underestimated jack kemp he has proven time and time again that he is a man who cares about people he is a man who does not use his political philosophy as an excuse to avoid helping the less fortunate i like jack kemp i like his integrity i like his sense of humor i respect his intellect and sense of fair play i also from time to time agree with his positions on issues he has been a staunch defender of israel and a tireless supporter of the fight to aid soviet jewry ill tell you about one thing jack may be leaving this body but we most certainly have not heard the last of him as a staunch member of the democratic party that worries me a little but as a friend and admirer of jack kemp the man i wish him well"], [0.9786020517349243, 0.9786020517349243, 0, "and from the committee on armed services as additional conferees for consideration of matters

new york is a bad amendment in a moment i will explain why the lent amendment should be defeated but before i address the amendment directly let me correct the record regarding the nature of the bryant provision which is the object of this amendment during debate on the bill a number of members have referred to mr bryants provision as a threat to our ability to finance the federal deficit some have even called its impact on the deficit a catastrophe before anyone dives off that board again let me warn him that there is no water in that pool the bryant amendment specifically exempts all debt of any kind i repeatthe bryant amendment exempts all debt of any kind treasury bills are exempt as well as every other form of indebtedness so please lets stop arguing about the impact of mr bryants initiative on the federal deficit there is no water in that pool now let me explain why mr lents amendment is defective most importantly it invites the worst sort of arbitrary secret dealmaking behind closed doors between the administration and foreign investors in order for someone to apply for a waiver and keep his dealings secret his application would have to be kept secret therefore under the lent amendment no one could challenge the secretarys decisions no matter how arbitrary they might be we wouldnt even know about them thus a disclosure amendment would be perverted into a safe house for foreign investors any foreign person who would prefer to keep secret his control of unitedstates property could apply to the secretary of commerce and ask for an exemption the secretary is free to grant the exemption on the basis of the flimsiest of showings all the applicant must show is that disclosure would substantially impair his willingness to invest obviously any foreign investor who wants to meet that test can do it simply by insisting that he wont make the investment unless the secretary grants the waiver there is virtually no way the secretary could say that the investor is wrong and how does the amendment define the term substantially impaired there is no definition instead under the amendment the secretary is permitted to define this and any other term in the bill the secretary is even allowed to redefine terms already defined in the bill in other words this amendment would turn a fair and balanced disclosure amendment into the legislative
