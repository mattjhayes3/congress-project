our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [0.0014038681983947754,

this congress last week we lost 49 innocent lives in the worst mass shooting that our country has ever seen sadly it is not an insulated case let me give you some numbers in the 3 years since the terrible tragedy at sandy hook elementary school there have been over 1 100 mass shootings more than 34 000 lives have been cut short by someone using a gun the house of representatives has held 30 moments of silence for the victims of mass shootings since sandy hook and yet we havent taken a single vote on legislation that would help keep guns out of dangerous hands i think that is shameful the american people deserve more than silence the american people deserve a congress that is willing to stand up and do whatever it takes to keep our communities safe that starts by making sure that terrorists criminal domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill dont have easy access to purchase guns in our country today suspected terrorists can legally buy guns in our country individuals who are on the fbis terrorist watch list can walk into a gun store pass a background check and walk out with a gun or the guns of their choosingand they can do it legally since 2004 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists were able to purchase guns more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon that they went in to buy now in the wake of the horrific attacks in orlando congress must make it a priority to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of suspected terrorists there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms in our country this bill is common sense if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun it is long past time for the republican leadership to bring that bill up for a vote we also need to pass my bipartisan bill to require background checks for all commercial gun sales background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms we know that background checks work every day they stop more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun unfortunately in 34 states criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill can bypass a background check by purchasing guns online or at a gun show this is a dangerous loophole that needs to be closed yesterday senate republicans blocked consideration of no fly no buy legislation and a measure to strengthen and enhance background checks now the republican house is going on with business as usual without giving the american people a vote to help prevent gun violence in our country if the republican leadership agrees that suspected terrorists criminals domestic

reason being is that for the last 312 years we have been trying to get a vote on this bipartisan prosecond amendment bill and in the course of those 31 2 years 34 000 people have been killed in our country by someone using a gun 34 000 that is someones child someones brother someones loved one someones wife someones husband someones partner and it is absolutely shameful now we heard yesterday on the steps of the capitol a terrifying story from a woman whose 10yearold daughter was murdered by someone with a gun someone who couldnt legally buy a gun because he couldnt pass a background check he was a felon but he got around that law because he went online he found the same gun that you could buy in a gun store online but without the requirement to pass a background check he bought that gun he shot that brave woman and he murdered her daughter we can take a step today to do something about that we can bring up the background check bill it is bipartisan prosecond amendment it has 186 coauthors in this house we can bring it up for a vote and we can pass it that will provide the first line of defense against people who shouldnt be able to buy guns from buying guns who are these people criminals domestic abusers terrorists those who are dangerously mentally ill they should not be able to get their hands on a gun now can we stop it in every instance no but we know that background checks work we know that we can make a real difference every day every day in the united states of america 170 felons are stopped from buying guns because of the background check program every day in the united states of america 50 domestic abusers are stopped from buying a gun because of the background check system it works we know it works why wont we bring that bill up for a vote that woman stood on the steps of the capitol yesterday that was a courageous stand she took she lost her daughter she watched her daughter be murdered right in front of her eyes she herself was shot but she is out advocating for sensible prosecond amendment reasonable gun laws that will protect people that is brave what is brave about avoiding a vote on this bill a bipartisan bill a bill that supports the second amendment a bill that has both democrats and republicans as coauthors 186 coauthors a background check bill perfectly constitutional perfectly reasonable supported by gun owners both democrats and republicans supported by 90 percent of the american people ninety percent of the people that we collectively represent are asking us do something about this tragedy that is taking place over 30 times a day in the streets of america ninety percent that is unbelievable support and what has the republican leadership done nothing thirtyfour thousand deaths in the last 312 years that we have been trying to take up this bill 1 182 mass shootings since we have tried to take up this bill 30 moments of silence on the floor of this house zero zero votes to protect the people that we represent zero votes to do anything regarding responsible second amendment gun laws that will protect the people that we represent we are not asking for a lot we are asking for a vote we know that background checks work your side knows it and our side know it one of the previous speakers on the underlying bill today said it is time to put politics aside and look at the policy what in the world is going on with background checks the policy is solid they work one hundred and seventy felons a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks fifty domestic abusers a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks it sounds like pretty solid policy to me it must be the politics on the other side that are getting in the way and the american people do not want that to continue ninety percent of the people who we represent are with us they say that criminals terrorists domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill should not be able to get guns and

district of new york i say to the gentleman that i look forward to tonights special order hour congressman jeffries and i along with our colleagues from the congressional black caucus will have scholarly debate on how our democracy is in crises because of the assault on the right to vote in america as we just heard from mr jeffries and we will hear from others voting is the voice of the people the voting rights act of 1965 passed with bipartisan support established strong federal protections for the freedom to vote banning or limiting many of the discriminatory election policies and practices of the jim crow south combined with subsequent legislation such as the national voter registration act which requires state agencies to provide opportunities for voter registration the voting rights act has helped our nation make significant progress in boosting voting for african americans and other historically marginalized groups but we find ourselves today facing our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the voting rights act as mr jeffries referenced in shelby the supreme court decision reversed over 50 years of progress made to expand access to the voting booth and opened a pathway to new voting laws that discriminate against african american voters as a result of shelby new voting restrictions have been put in place in 22 states 18 of them republicanled since 2010 making it harder for millions of americans to exercise their right to vote the way states have been able to reduce the voting power of minority communities and put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote is appalling our democracy is in crisis our right to vote is under assault why would we want to make it harder for americans to vote i believe we should be making it easier for americans to have access to the ballot box but apparently some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not agree we need to put forth a vote on the voting rights act now new laws range from strict photo id requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restriction among these 16 states with new voting restrictions is my home state of ohio in ohio in 2014 lawmakers cut 6 days of early voting and eliminated the golden week during which voters could register and cast a ballot all in one trip of course ohio is not alone in its efforts to make it harder for americans to vote the freedom to vote is one of americas most constitutionally guaranteed rights and it should be easily accessible to those who want to exercise it that is why i am honored this congress to serve as the deputy vice chair of the newly created congressional voting rights caucus a caucus dedicated to protecting our democracy by ensuring the fundamental right to vote is safeguarded for all americans however after a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on voting protections house republicans now refuse to bring either bill to the floor for a vote this is unthinkable the voting rights act of 1965 has been reauthorized with bipartisan support five times congress has a duty to ensure elections are free and transparent so that all eligible voters feel comfortable and welcome i would echo president obamas february 13 2013 statement on the voting rights act and let me quote we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected that includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote when any american no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right we are betraying our ideals there are 168 days until the presidential election and our democracy still has far too many missing voices particularly among those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeply rooted racial and class barriers in our society we must ensure that voter suppression is not the new normal in order to have a truly vibrant democracy the united states must take steps to ensure inclusive voting by reducing barriers to voting efforts to suppress voting turnout undermine democracy and those efforts are on the wrong side of history as i close the time is now i am calling on all people including our community and national leaders to join me in working to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched for died for that is the voting rights act human rights organizations like the naacp and the leadership conference on civil and human rights have been at the forefront of these issues along with my colleagues members of the

a congressional black caucus assessment during national minority health month it is no surprise that we are here today because certainly we have had many firsthand experiences to know the disparities that exist across all americans but more specifically across african american communities to you mr payne thank you for having the foresight to come tonight and to you congresswoman kelly thank you for taking a leadership position in helping us share with the nation the value and the importance of protecting all lives but giving information to the nation about the state of black health it is imperative that we continue to address health disparities that affect racial minorities and work together on the efforts to advance health equity since july 1971 the congressional black caucus has sponsored national conferences and held brain trusts on black health it is so timely that we have this discussion as we observe national minority health month tonight is a call to action a charge for all of us to unite towards a common goal of improving the health of our communities everyone in america should be able to live a healthy life regardless of the color of their skin the good news is the overall health of an american has improved over the past few decades this is in part due to the increased focus on preventive medicine and dynamic new advances in medical technology however not all americans have benefited equally from healthcare improvements since the enactment of the affordable care act millions of americans now have access to quality affordable coverage according to the american medical association recent studies have shown that despite the steady improvement in overall health of the united states racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services and are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than nonminorities disparities in health care exist even when controlling for gender condition age and socioeconomic status for example cardiovascular diseases account for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between african americans and nonhispanic whites according to the american cancer society african american women have a 44 percent higher death rate from breast cancer despite having a mammography screening rate that is nearly the same rate for white women according to the centers for disease control the cdc the infant death rate among african americans is still more than double that of whites tonight you are going to hear my colleagues and i discuss much data and statistics because i am from the great state of ohio and ohio ranks 47th in the nation in infant mortality with black infants dying at twice the rate of white infants according to a 2015 study conducted by the kaiser family foundation in ohio on average 14 5 black infants die per every 1 000 live births while 6 3 white infants die ohio community leaders and the greater columbus infant mortality task force are working hard to lower franklin countys infant mortality rate and the infant mortality rate in all of ohio tonight i salute them for their research for their education and for their consistency to save lives the statistics are staggering and we can and must do more to lower and eliminate them the societal burden of healthcare disparities in america manifest in multiple and major ways for example a 2014 study by the joint center for political and economic studies concluded that the combined costs of health inequalities and premature death in the united states were 1 24 trillion that 1 24 trillion is the cost between 2003 and 2006 that is why on march 23 2010 when president barack obama signed the affordable care act it was a monumental step that has helped us address the overwhelming statistics and health disparities within our community i proudly supported the affordable care act because lives matter all lives matter black lives matter now we have comprehensive healthcare reform that improves access to affordable health coverage and guarantees that the most vulnerable in our communities have access to care by improving access to quality health care for all americans the affordable care act helps reduce health disparities how does the affordable care act do this this law invests in prevention and wellness gives individuals more control over their care and expands initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in healthcare professions by strengthening cultural competency training for all healthcare providers and improving communications between providers and patients the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history congressman payne and congresswoman kelly again i salute you i am going to repeat that because it is so important for us to let the nation know that the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history the affordable care act also increases funding for community health centers which serve an estimated one in three lowincome people and one in four lowincome minority residents there are over 43 community health centers in ohio including many in my district columbus neighborhood health centers heart of ohio family health centers and lower lights christian health centers these community health centers provide outstanding primary care dental behavioral health and pharmacy services in our most underserved areas in 2013 community health centers provided care to over 550 000 ohioans and recorded over 2 million patient visits we have come a long way but there is still much more for us to do all people should have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential for health we must continue to move forward to combat health disparities build healthier communities and create a stronger country in order to have a successful nation i believe we must have a healthy nation let me leave you with something a national figure once said if you neglect to recharge a battery it dies if you run full speed ahead without stopping for water you lose momentum to

served as the executive director of the national network to end domestic violence twenty years ago we worked with a bipartisan congress to pass the domestic violence offender gun ban it became law in 1996 it was known as the lautenberg amendment after the late senator frank lautenberg of new jersey since that time we have made a lot of progress in preventing domestic violence but sadly there are several mack trucksize loopholes that prevent the law from coming to its full effect in fact just last week in a fight against the gun lobby yet again over these last 20 years the supreme court upheld the domestic violence offender gun ban in a 62 decision as many know leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim and adding a firearm to that situation severely heightens the risk of injury or death in fact in america the majority of fatal domestic violence homicides are committed with firearms at least 52 percent of american women murdered with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members despite impressions from media coverage mass shootings in which at least four people are murdered with a gun are also typically acts of domestic or family violence an everytown usa analysis of every mass shooting between 2009 and 2015 found that 57 percent were committed by intimate partners or the family of victims research shows that commonsense gun laws have a marked effect on improving womens safety from gun violence in states that require background checks for all handgun sales 46 percent fewer women are murdered with a gun by an intimate partner and state laws ensuring that convicted abusers or those subject to domestic violence restraining orders are separated from their firearms are also associated with reductions in gun violence against women but because of loopholes in these laws and failures to enforce them they do little to curb the uniquely lethal american problem of guns and violence against women four gaps in the law are particularly harmful first federal law does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of abusive dating partners or convicted stalkers the federal law prohibits domestic abusers from buying or owning guns but doesnt apply to dangerous people convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses or to dating partners even though more women in the unitedstates are killed by their dating partners than their spouses second in 35 states state law does not prohibit all people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes and all people subject to restraining orders from buying or using guns third and importantly federal law allows domestic abusers and stalkers to easily evade gun prohibitions by purchasing guns from unlicensed private sellers that is the mack truck loophole federal law only requires background checks for gun sales at licensed dealers sixteen states require checks on all handgun sales but in the remaining states prohibited abusers seeking to avoid a background check have very little trouble purchasing a gun from an unlicensed dealer they meet online at a gun show or in a parking lot prohibited domestic abusers know about this loophole and they have taken advantage of it to deadly effect and in fact in a firstofitskind investigation of illegal gun sales mayors against illegal guns found that one in four prohibited purchasers seeking guns online had a domestic violence arrest finally 41 states do not require prohibited abusers to relinquish the guns they already own so i have joined in legislation to prohibit these guns from falling into the hands of domestic abusers we know that a proven way to help with people who are not eligible to purchase guns such as felons and domestic abusers is to expand and strengthen universal background checks on all firearms sales no matter where that sale takes place and very tragically our lax gun laws make it easier for abusers to acquire a firearm than it is in fact to purchase a box of sudafed so you ask why do we protest why did we take the dramatic action of taking to the floor of this house it is because we have had enough and we know that working together we can and must change the fact that women across this country lose their lives to gun violence by their domestic abusers nine american women are shot and killed by their husbands and intimate partners every single week we can do something about it lets close the gun show loophole"], [0.0014899373054504395, 0.9985100626945496, 1, "americans want congress to pass meaningful legislation that will actually keep guns out of dangerous hands

supposed to represent to put partisan politics aside and to bring up commonsense bipartisan legislation to keep guns away from those who shouldnt have them suspected terrorists criminals domestic

bipartisan it respects the second amendment rights of lawabiding citizens i am a gun guy i own guns i support the second amendment if this bill did anything to violate those rights my name wouldnt be on it all this background check bill does is require that folks pass a background check before purchasing guns online at a gun show or through an ad plain and simple it does nothing to infringe on the second amendment right of lawabiding citizens to own firearms this debate on background checks isnt a choice between either protecting the second amendment or reducing gun violence it is about the

congressional black caucus and congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries for always being timely in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues we hope maybe the american people will hear us but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak so i am thankful for that i want to pay tribute overall to the congressional black caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009 2008 and 2010 passage ultimately of the affordable care act where the work that we did joining congresswoman donna christianchristiansen at that time and frank pallone on the congressional health caucus but on the cbc we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the affordable care act addressed the issue of health disparities there was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the office of minority health that i had worked on in years past so it was the lightning bolt of the caucus and then working with the congressional asian pacific american caucus and then the congressional hispanic caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about i remember debating on the floor of the house on the issues of dealing with senior citizen african american men and how they access health care how do women access health care and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care these are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the african american population we were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didnt know how to ask the questions how do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an african american male a senior citizen my father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain so we knew we had a serious issue so today i want to mention four points but i am going to focus on the last one obesitya question of access to health care and physical fitness many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court mental healthif you lived your life in a segregated america if you were called boy and girl it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced if you live in a situation of poverty of a single household maybethis is not across the boardthese issues will be impacted if you lived around gun violence if you saw your 15yearold friend being shot dead in the street there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children hiv aids is something that we have lived through i remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s particularly with hiv aids so we have worked in the congressional black caucus to massively talk about testing let me get to this point that i want to dwell just for a moment on and that is gun violence i was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district today had a memorial they had one yesterday we will have one tomorrow and have one on wednesday i mourn with congresswoman corinne brown of florida we are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place but it is important to note that this is a health issue because the centers for disease control can assess and study every health issue that faces america today but they are legislatively by law prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle by republicans disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence gun violence is killing our children and killing our families in orlando it killed latinos who happened to be the attendees at the pulse club the lgbtq community was the dominant community and a hateful terroristic act using ar15s and glock guns killed them the incident was the deadliest mass shooting the next deadliest incidents in recent history were april 16 2007 virginia tech 32 killed 17 injured december 14 2012 sandy hook 26 killed 1 injured october 16 1991 killeen texas 23 killed 27 injured according to everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the united states in 2016 and the 150th mass shooting in united states since january 1 2009 the mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health the sanctity and the minority community it is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a harvard professor talked about and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns the materials i have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with gunsdone with guns san bernardino chattanooga charleston garland oak creek and fort hood were all done with guns so i stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings singular killings are impacted by poverty lack of access to health care the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities and the failure of the united states congress to put real gun safety legislation closing the loophole the jim clyburn rule that says that if you dont get the review and approval by atf you do not get the gun you have to wait until you get the approval from atf which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems mental health or background issues doesnt need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse their children their neighbors their family members or strangers so it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity the issues of mental health and hiv aids can be with great investment researched for cures or cancer that proliferates in our community triple negative breast cancer legislation that i have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact but it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about the disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious i want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym lgbtq community i want to say it over and over again because i think it is shameful that in our debate in our recognition of the tragedy of orlando that we dont acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community as i stand here that community is diverse and there are african americans who are lgbtq so i would ask that as we move forward this week we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure we will be reminded of this violence and we will have a cure that cure first of all will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of wartype bullets that men and women in the united states military say have no business on the streets of america i believe congresswoman that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome i thank the gentlewoman for having this special order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and or geographically defined population groups i want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact african americans that we can do something about 1 obesity 2 mental health 3 hiv aids and 4 gun violence african americans based on 2015 census data comprise 13 2 percent of the unitedstates population or about 42 million people socioeconomic status in turn is linked to mental health people who are impoverished homeless incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health as the founder and chair of the congressional childrens caucus i am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among africanamerican youth more than 40 percent of african american teenagers are overweight and nearly 25 percent are obese the percentage of children aged 611 years in the united states who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012 african american youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise this combination has led to an epidemic of obesity which directly contributes to numerous deadly or lifethreatening diseases or conditions including the following hypertension dyslipidemia high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke gallbladder disease osteoarthritis asthma bronchitis sleep apnea and other respiratory problems cancer breast colon and endometrial when ethnicity and income are considered the picture is even more troubling african american youngsters from lowincome families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higherincome families efforts such as the lets move campaign by the first lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children nonhispanic blacks have the highest ageadjusted rates of obesity at 47 8 percent according to the cdc 37 6 percent of men and 56 9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese every year more than 40 million americans struggle with mental illness african american men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness but they are less likely to get help racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of african americans negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased but continue to occur with measurable adverse consequences historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of african americans in mind according to the department of health and human services office of minority health adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness hopelessness and worthlessness than are adult whites how african americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment in 1996 mha commissioned a national survey on clinical depression the survey explored the barriers preventing americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression this survey revealed that 63 percent of african americans believe that depression is a personal weakness this is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent only 31 percent of african americans believed that depression was a health problem african americans were more likely to believe that depression was normal than the overall survey average 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse many of these problems persist to this day as doctor william lawson of howard university and mhas district of columbia affiliate pointed out in an npr interview in 2012 many africanamericans have a lot of negative feelings about or not even aware of mental health services the mental health culture race and ethnicity supplement to the 1999 unitedstates surgeon generals report on mental health states the following africanamerican physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat africanamerican patients africanamerican patients who see africanamerican physicians rate their physicians styles of interaction as more participatory african americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding african american mental health professionals in 1998 only 2 percent of psychiatrists 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were african americans the public mental health safety net of hospitals community health centers and local health departments are vital to many african americans especially to those in highneed populations african americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but overrepresented in inpatient treatment few africanamerican children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth in 2012 there were an estimated 356 268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in unitedstates prisons and jails there were only 35 000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals the report the treatment of persons with mental illness in prisons and jails jails in 44 of the 50 states and the district of columbia a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital the report said african americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons people of color account for 60 percent of the prison population the stanford law school three strikes projects report stated that over the past 15 years the number of mentally ill people in prison in california has almost doubled in california 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year african americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users but for 37 percent of drug arrests illicit drug use is frequently associated with selfmedication among people with mental illnesses in january 2014 the texas observer reported that of the 9 000 inmates in harris county jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of texas staterun public mental hospitals combined the passage of the affordable care act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the medicaid component of the aca disparities can occur if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time as noted by the office of minority health only 8 7 percent of adult blacks versus 16 percent of adult whites received treatment for mental health concerns in 20072008 only 6 2 percent of adult blacks versus 13 9 percent of adult whites received medications for mental health concerns during 2008 while 68 7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment only 53 2 percent of adult blacks did the affordable care act will have an impact on this gap by 2016

14 percent of the people living with hiv are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with hiv are virally suppressed which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others hiv is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the african american and latino community there is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young but also the older persons when treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill few talk about the advances in hiv treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in lifes normal activities the virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests this does not mean that people are cured but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment anyone can become infectedso it is up to all of us to educate our families neighbors coworkers and friends about getting tested there are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with hiv to enroll in qualified health insurance plans in states like texas that are not fully participating in the affordable care acts medicaid expansion this is especially problematic for hiv patients who are poor some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential hiv medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped"], [0.0014932751655578613,

country gun violence zika and flint michigans poisoned water it is now nearly 8 weeks later congress has returned from the longest summer recess in more than 60 years but we still have seen no action from the republican majority on our nations most urgent crises meanwhile we are in the midst of a zika outbreak puerto rico is on track to see 25 of its population infected florida has locally

terrified that the baby may be born with devastating lifelong health problems yet republicans refuse to provide the funding we need to combat this outbreak instead of passing a bill with sufficient funding republicans insist on making sure believe it or not that the confederate flag can fly at va cemeteries and on preventing family planning clinics from helping patients with zika that is right even though zika has the greatest impact on women who are or could become pregnant republicans want to add a rider to stop the family planning clinics that serve women from responding to zika today family planning clinics like planned parenthood are already on the front lines in fighting against zika in addition to providing family planning services planned parenthood volunteers are visiting 25 000 households in florida to find people of reproductive age especially young women who have likely not been reached by state or federal zika education efforts they are providing zika kits for pregnant women containing items like insect repellent and standing water treatment family planning clinics are an important part of our response to zika but instead of recognizing that fact republicans have doubled down on their extreme views on womens health dr anthony fauci the head of the infectious disease institute at the national institutes of health has said in no uncertain terms that if we do not pass additional zika funding we will have to stop our efforts to develop a vaccine already federal agencies have had to borrow money from other critical health priorities to address

the tyranny of the majority to act on gun violence prevention measurestheir deliberate inaction in the face of 33 000 deaths caused by gun violence every year we came to demand substantive action to address our countrys epidemic of gun violence yet today we will be presented with legislation promoted by the nra that fails to address this serious problem h r 4237 does not close or otherwise address the terror gap that allows known or suspected terrorists in the united states to legally buy guns instead this bill handicaps law enforcement creating an impossibly burdensome process and allowing terrorists to take advantage of the charleston loophole in fact h r 4237 doesnt just leave the loophole open which led to the loss of nine lives at the emanuel ame church it reinforces it and the terror gap under this legislation to prevent the transfer of a firearm the government will be required to file an emergency petition schedule a hearing provide the suspect with notice and counsel and win the hearing all within 72 hours of the attempted purchase and even if the government is able to win the hearing it can only prevent the transfer if the court finds that the suspected terrorist committed attempted to or will commit an act of terrorism put another way the government can only prevent a gun sale to a suspected terrorist if they can arrest the person for terrorist activity within 3 days of an attempted purchase ultimately this legislation does not provide any meaningful safeguards to prevent terrorists from purchasing guns sadly it is nothing more than a political tactic to avoid responsibility a contrived effort to look busy and feign concern while thousands of americans lose their lives to gun violence the american people are smarter than this we have a moral responsibility to do something meaningful the american people demand that we do more that we do something that we do anything to help prevent another mass tragedy in this country make no mistake this legislation falls short of a goodfaith effort to save lives the gao found that individuals on the terrorist watch list were able to pass a background check and legally purchase a firearm 2 043 times between february of 2004 and december of 2014 the fbi was only able to prevent 10 percent of these purchases as we all unfortunately learned on june 12 when we fail to prevent dangerous individuals from getting their hands on guns we put the lives of americans at risk but there is legislation that the house can consider that will reduce gun violence first h r 1076 the no fly no buy bill would effectively close the terror gap by providing the department of justice with the discretion to block gun sales to terrorist suspects it will preserve due process for individuals who were mistakenly listed to appeal their denial second h r 1217 would implement universal background checks for all commercial gun sales it is a measure supported by the overwhelming majority of the american people and empirical research shows that universal background checks for all handgun sales have lowered levels of gun violence in those states where that occurs nationally 34 percent of gun sales and 40 percent of all gun transfers occur without a background check this legislation would represent an important step toward closing this loophole and reducing gun violence i urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to bring these two bills to the floor to respond to the demands of the american people to do something about the pandemic of gun violence to do something meaningful that will actually reduce gun violence in this country and protect the american people as we are sworn to do i know i speak for all of my colleagues in the democratic caucus we will continue to fight in every way that

colleagues worked so hard to do was to take affordable health care away from 22 million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced with a tough choice i can assure them it is not a tough choice for the president because it is not a tough choice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care away from 22 million americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice

in congestion on our roadways this is an amendment that i hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would embraceat least lets talk about a level playing field where we are not giving preference to the rural areas versus the urban areas urban areas which i would argue use the rail a pretty significant amount in terms of how we are moving people around not to mention our goods and services this is an amendment that i think is a commonsense amendment and i would hope that i would get some support from my good friend from florida and maybe we could get him to even reconsider but i hope i am not tilting at windmills on that one i yield back the balance of my time the acting chair the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from illinois"], [0.9884859323501587,

replace the infrastructure that amtrak owns along with the acquisition and maintenance of amtraks fleet of locomotives passenger cars and other equipment the chicago area which i represent is the hub of our nations transportation network over 30 million people ride amtrak every year nationwide and many of those passengers ride through the city of chicago however in the chicago area amtrak trains are running on infrastructure that has not been updated in decades including switches that date back to the administration of teddy roosevelt as we have seen in recent months safety concerns on amtrak are at a premium now is not the time to reduce the amount of money that we have made available for amtrak and for our needed infrastructure upgrades we need to make investments in our tracks our trains our stations and the rest of our transportation system my amendment would take a step towards addressing that problem all it does is restore capital investment grants to the level at which they were appropriated last year this is a small step but one that will help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and will help improve the mass transit systems that so many of our citizens use each and

house with a vote of 4100 in 2008 it passed in the house of representatives by 4030 in 2009 by 4240 in 2010 by 4210 in 2010 of course and thereafter we stopped passing resolutions on the floor of the house although we may still present them and talk about them on the floor of the house so tonight this is what we will do i would like to mention the mission of the naacp which is to ensure the political educational social and economic equality of all personsnot just of black people not just of people of color but of all people the naacp also desires to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination these are lofty and noble goals because we understand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial discrimination in this country and the naacp took it upon itself to eliminate as much of it as possible it has done a good job i might add lets look at a little bit of the history of the naacp back on february 12 1909 a group of people decided that it was going to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in this country literally in this country between 1889 and 1918 thousands of african americans were lynchedthousands lynching was done with mob violence people were taken to trees and they were lynched it was done a good many times with impunity no one was ever prosecuted it was a grave injustice and there were people in this country who decided that they were going to do something about this injustice among the people who met initially were mary white ovington oswald garrison villard william english walling and ida wellsbarnett these persons met and issued a clarion call some 60 persons answered that call hence the naacp was born the naacp did not have its first african american as an executive secretary until 1920 it is important for us to note that many of the founders of the naacpin fact most of themwere not of african ancestry the first executive secretaries of the organization were all persons who were of european ancestry in fact the first five executive secretaries were white they were not black in 1934 the naacp had its first black board chairpersonlouis t wright dr wright became chairperson after the naacp had had a good number of white chairpersons so the naacp has never been and is not now an organization for blacks only the naacp has always stood for an integrated society and has been an integrated organization since its inception in 1954 the naacp under the leadership and counsel of the honorable thurgood marshall who became a justice of the supreme court won the lawsuit of brown v board of education this was a giant leap forward for us because this lawsuit integrated to a certain extent schools throughout the country the word that was appropriately used at the time was desegregated these schools were ordered to be desegregated with all deliberate speed and all deliberate speed can sometimes take a lot longer than one might expect a good many years later there are still those who would contend that we have not fully integrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the country in 1955 an naacp member the honorable rosa parks an african american lady decided that she was going to take a stand and she took that stand by taking a seat she took a seat on a bus in so doing she ignited a spark that started a civil rights movement by the way there are many people who contend that she did this because she was tired well she may have been tired but she did it because she wanted to take a stand she was tired of societys relegating her to the back of the bus and she took a stand against it hence we had the montgomery bus boycott which lasted more than a year at the end of that boycott the bus linethe transportation systemwas integrated in alabama and of course later on throughout the country an interesting note on this point about the integration and desegregation of bus lines there was a threejudge panel that actually heard the litigation associated with this transportation issue on that threejudge panel there were judges who had a great debate about this but there was one frank m johnson a federal district court judge who took the position that we could apply the brown decision to public transportation this was the very first time it was done was under the leadership of that threejudge panel and by the honorable frank m johnson again i point these things out because it is important to note that there were others who were there with the naacp to help us along the way frank m johnson by the way was a republican appointee who was appointed by president eisenhower and he went on to help us to integrate schools throughout the south and integrate the department of public safety he went on to help us with the facilitation of voting rights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons from discriminating against persons in workplace environments he really played a significant role as did many other persons who were associated with the naacp in a vicarious way because i dont have evidence of his having been a member i want to move forward if i may next to 2008 i move forward to 2008 because this is when the naacp supported the passage of the emmett till unsolved civil rights crime act of 2007 there are many unsolved cases in the history of this country with reference to things that happened to african americans the naacp pushed for and supported legislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the dastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing no harm to anyone the naacp has fought for this in 2009 the naacp celebrated its centennial anniversary and the theme at that time was bold dreams and big victories obviously a good theme because the naacp has won many big victories in 2012 the naacp supported the smart and safe campaign which brought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration in this country people who study these issues are well aware that in this country we have an overpopulation of persons who are incarcerated much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws much of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of one type of offense with drugs to receive a harsher penaltycocaine for example then if you have crack cocaine you will get a stiffer penalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine the point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many people to be incarcerated who quite frankly should not be incarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated some of these three strikes and you are out laws have also caused persons to go to prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third offense so the naacp is fighting against this"]],
