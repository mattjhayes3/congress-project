last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is 3 000 diapers for little ben the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 is really money for real people let us do the right thing let us pass this rule let us pass this legislation let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working

representing the south side of chicago and the south suburbs communities like joliet and lancing and morris and rural communities like tonica and elsewhere and they often ask me a pretty basic question that question is as we talk about taxes they say why why do married working couples a husband and wife who are both in the workforce why do they pay higher taxes when they get married they ask is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes on average 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes than identical couples who choose not to get married but live together outside of marriage that is not right the folks back home tell me that it is time that those of us here in washington should do something about it that we should work to eliminate what has been called the marriage tax penalty 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is a lot of money back home in illinois 1 400 is one years tuition for a nursing student at joliet junior college our local community college it is three months of day care for a working mom and dad with children it is almost 4 000 diapers for a family with a newborn child it is real money for real people and there are of course some here in washington who say they would much rather spend that money here in washington than bring about tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty well i am proud to say this house is doing something about the marriage tax penalty last year we passed and sent legislation to the president which would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for over 25 million couples and unfortunately president clinton and vice president gore vetoed that bill they had a lot of excuses they wanted to spend that money but this year there is no excuse we have valentines day approaching and what better gift to give 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty than to pass legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty this thursday we will be considering in the house legislation approved by the committee on ways and means h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say now has 236 cosponsors including almost 30 democrats who have joined with us in our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty we help real people let me introduce a couple here this couple here shad and michelle hallihan of joliet illinois two public school teachers in joliet illinois they happen to make about 60 000 in combined income from their two teaching salaries and shad and michelle suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty well under the legislation that the house is going to be considering this week shad and michelle will benefit because two public school teachers who chose to get married who now suffer the marriage tax penalty will essentially have their marriage tax penalty wiped out michelle told me the other day she says congressman tell your friends in the congress particularly those who believe it is not a good idea to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what wiping out the marriage tax penalty would mean for them they say 1 000 which is essentially the marriage tax penalty would buy 3 000 diapers for their newborn baby that is money that is currently going to washington that they could use to take care of their child frankly if we want to be fair it is their money we should eliminate the marriage tax penalty this thursday h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will help couples like shad and michele hallihan we do it in several ways we double the standard deduction onehalf of married couples do not itemize their taxes they use the standard deduction so we double it for joint filers the marriage penalty is created when a married couple of course get married they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket that is what pushes shad and michelle into the 28 percent bracket what we want to do of course is for the nonitemizers which is about half of the married couples who suffer the marriage penalty to double the standard deduction for joint filers to make it twice that of singles for those who itemize who are the other half of married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty those who itemize are homeowners the average middleclass family itemizes their taxes because they own a home we want to help them and provide marriage tax relief as well so we widen the 15 percent bracket the basic tax bracket that every one of us pays we are all in the 15 percent bracket regardless of our income for the lowest bottom bracket of our income by widening the bracket so that joint filers married couples can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in that same bracket we help those who itemize we also help the working poor there is a marriage penalty for the earned income credit and we provide tax relief for them this thursday let us have an overwhelming bipartisan majority let us work together let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty there are no excuses we want to be fair eliminate the marriage tax penalty"], [0.007549641653895378, 0.007549641653895378, 0, "i want to take a few minutes to just talk about a very fundamental issue a fundamental issue of importance to 50 million american taxpayers 50 million middleclass working americans i have often been asked whether i am at the steel workers hall in hegwish in the south side of chicago or the legion post in joliet or a chamber of commerce or the coffee shop called weits cafe in morris illinois my hometown or the local grain elevator a pretty fundamental question and that question is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married folks back home just do not understand why for almost 30 years we have had a marriage tax penalty which the average is 1 400 each for 25 million married working couples in the south suburbs in the south side of chicago 1 400 is real money it is a years tuition at a local community college for a nursing student it is 3 months of day care it is a washer and a dryer it is 4 000 diapers for a child we need to address the issue of fairness we need to address the issue to wipe out the marriage tax penalty suffered by 50 million married working people it is an issue of fairness here is how it works what causes the marriage tax penalty is when a couple decides to marry when they file their taxes they file jointly when they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket let me introduce shad and michele hallihan two public school teachers from joliet illinois shad and michele have been married almost 2 years now they just had a baby a wonderful young couple but they suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty now shad and michele have a combined income of about 62 000 suppose that they have an equal income each making 31 000 michele here if she stayed single would be in the 15 percent tax bracket but because she and shad married their combined income of 62 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket creating well over almost the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 we want to help couples like shad and michele michele pointed out to me that the average marriage tax penalty would buy almost 4 000 diapers for their newborn baby should not those couples like michele and shad be allowed to keep money keep their hardearned salary their hardearned income rather than paying a tax just because they are married we are working to address that and i was so pleased that this house of representatives overwhelmingly supported with a bipartisan vote 268 members of the house endorsed wiping out the marriage tax penalty in order to help couples such as michele and shad hallihan h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act passed this house as a standalone bill and addresses one issue the need to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples if we look at who pays the marriage tax penalty one half of them itemize their taxes millions of middleclass families itemize because they own a home or give money to church or charity have education expenses well we wipe out the marriage tax penalty for those who itemize their taxes by widening the 15 percent tax bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much as single filers and stay in the 15 percent tax bracket that will help shad and michele hallihan for those who do not itemize we double the standard deduction helping those who do not itemize by doubling the standard deduction to be twice that of single people we also help the working poor those who participate in the earned income credit by addressing the income eligibility eliminating the marriage penalty for the working poor as well it is a good bill it helps those who itemize it helps those who do not itemize the primary beneficiaries are those with incomes between 30 000 and 75 000 those who suffer the marriage tax penalty the most we do not raise taxes on anyone we wipe out the marriage tax penalty we help stayathome moms we help those who are homeowners eliminating the marriage tax penalty is a fundamental issue of fairness and that is what it is all about let us make our tax code more fair now this legislation the marriage tax elimination

or other poison pills my hope is that they will keep it a clean bill and that they will move expeditiously and as quickly as possible to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for couples like michele and

of time we will have a broad overview but at this point i would like to just focus very narrowly on one aspect of the vice presidents plan my colleagues may recall that the vice president was one of many voices that urged the president of the united states to veto the marriage penalty tax relief that was passed by this congress and sent to the president soon after the president vetoed the marriage penalty tax relief the vice president announced that he would give marriage penalty relief by doubling the standard deduction i think it is probably worth our while to realize what this means exactly in terms of the vice presidents claim that it is marriage penalty tax relief certainly what it means by way of comparison with the marriage penalty tax relief that was granted by this congress and vetoed by the president the first thing my colleagues should realize is that in the congressional bill written by the republicans and passed on to the president vetoed by the president all married couples irrespective of their filing status received relief from the unfair marriage penalty the vice presidents proposal that he now outlines only gives relief to those people who do not itemize their taxes if a couple owns a home and decides to deduct their mortgage interest they will get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan if a couple gives to their church and deducts charitable contributions they get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan e0 1600 if you your spouse or your child is ill and you deduct your skyrocketing medical bills you get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan if you or your spouse work at home and deduct the cost of a home office you get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan and if you jump through hoops to become eligible for one of the new credits that the vice president has proposed complicating our tax code even further than it is now than the vice president will not give you relief from the unfair marriage penalty and that is wrong that is just the beginning of the serious concern i have with the details of the vice presidents plan let me say it is a commonplace observation in this town that the devil is in the details armeys axiom is if you make a deal with the devil you are the junior partner and i am about to demonstrate in this next hour that indeed the devil that we do not want to make a deal with is in the details of the vice presidents plan let us take a look at the big picture first the vice president would spend the onbudget surplus he would rob the social security trust fund and he would provide a measly tax cut designed to manipulate behavior instead of giving meaningful tax relief one of the things that we are very proud of in this congress one of the things that we have been able to do thanks primarily to the success of the american people in creating an enormous economic success story here in america and the revenues that have accrued to the government out of our economic success is that we have managed to stop the raid on social security not only do we set aside 100 percent of all social security tax dollars that people find in their payroll stubs as fica tax 100 percent of all medicare tax surpluses set aside by this congress thus ending the 40year raid on social security and medicare but we have even managed in this congress to set aside a large portion of the onbudget budget surplus what is the onbudget budget surplus that is the part of the budget surplus that accrues to the government from your social security taxes not from your medicare taxes but from your income taxes so that we are now setting 90 percent of all budget surplus aside for debt reduction the vice presidents plan would take all of that income tax surplus which we call onbudget surplus and he would spend it but worse than that he would renew the old practice a practice that should be forgotten of robbing from the social security trust fund for new risky spending schemes that we will talk about later at the same time he would provide a bureaucratic governmentrun prescription drug plan that is not guaranteed to bring the cost of drugs down indeed the vice presidents onesizefitsall youmustjointhegovernment plan threatens to force the price of prescription drugs up let us address his spending plans first according to vice president gores numbers he would increase federal spending by about 900 billion through the year 2010 however the senate budget committee shows a much highber price tag they added up the numbers and found that the vice president would spend 2 1 trillion of new spending and he would not stop there think of it this way the vice presidents plan is 191 pages that means that each page of his book would cost taxpayers an amazing 18 4 billion per page it means that for every dollar by which the vice president would cut taxes he would spend 6 75 if you look at the details we find that vice president gore dramatically underestimates the cost of his new retirement entitlement program built on top of the social security program that is not new this has been a part of our problem historically in the past with democrat congresses that created new mandatory spending programs and dramatically underestimated their cost the vice president says his new retirement program which is very similar to the clinton universal savings account which was a trial balloon which the clinton administration floated until it popped that this would cost 200 billion over 10 years but an analysis by dr john colgen of stanford university shows that if everyone eligible to participate in it it would cost 160 billion in the first year alone the vice president says his plan would cost 200 billion over 10 years professor colgen of stanford university says if everybody eligible participated it would be 160 billion for the first year alone the vice president mistakenly calls this brand new massive retirement spending program a tax cut true enough it would be run through the irs and that would give this agency still more power and control over the lives of americans but this is no tax cut instead the vice president would give government checks to people some of whom do not even pay taxes our budget rules would score it on the spending side not on the tax side other parts of this big government agenda include massive new spending on energy environment transportation and crime all important items on our policy agenda but to pay for this the vice president would rob the social security system we have stopped that raid on social security and i believe that the american people would agree with me there is no going back i see the gentleman from wisconsin one of our brighter and younger newer members of the republican caucus has joined me and i see he has some very interesting graphs there so i yield to professor ryan so that he can help us look into this case even

industrial communities like joliet and a lot of suburban towns as well as cornfields and grain elevators the folks back home have a pretty clear message even in such a diverse district they want us to meet our challenges and work together and come up with solutions that is why they are so proud of what this congress has accomplished in the last 4 years with balancing the budget for the first time in 28 years cutting taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years reforming welfare for the first time in a generation and taming the tax collector by reforming the irs for the first time ever those are real accomplishments and folks say well thats pretty good but thats history what are we going to do next well this congress and this republican house have several very very important goals we want to strengthen and make our schools not only better but safer we want to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent social security revenues for social security we want to pay down the national debt and of course we want to continue working to lower taxes for the middle class and for working families this year as we work to lower taxes and to lower the tax burden for middleclass families i believe that the approach we should take is to adclress the unfairness in the tax code because when i listen to the folks back home whether in the union hall or the vfw a local chamber of commerce or at a coffee shop in my hometown down on liberty street people say that not only are their taxes too high they complain about the complexity and the unfairness of the tax code i believe this series of questions really illustrates a key area of unfairness that we should make a priority in this congress this year in getting the job done on eliminating this most unfair area of our tax code that is why i want to explain why enactment of the marriage tax elimination act is so important with the question of fairness do americans really feel that it is fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes just because they are married do americans feel that it is right that 21 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more under our tax code just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple with identical incomes who live together outside of marriage clearly i think the american people agree that the marriage tax penalty is wrong and we need to set it right the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong it is wrong that under our tax code you are punished for getting married as i noted earlier it affects 21 million married working couples on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married let me give an example here of a couple in the south suburbs of chicago you have a case where a machinist and of course this particular machinist works at caterpillar in joliet he makes the heavy machinery that we use to mine and dig things and build things he makes 30 500 if he is single after the standard deductions and exemptions he is in the 15 percent tax bracket but under our tax code because two working people who choose to get married their incomes are combined and in fact you file your taxes jointly you are pushed into a higher tax bracket this example of this south suburban couple this machinist who meets and marries a schoolteacher in the joliet public schools with an identical income of 30 500 because under our tax code they combine their incomes and their combined income is 61 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and because this machinist and this schoolteacher in joliet illinois in the south suburbs of chicago chose to get married they pay more in taxes that is just wrong of course i would like to point out that for this schoolteacher and this machinist in joliet 1 400 is real money 1 400 is one years tuition at joliet junior college our local community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center we need to eliminate that marriage tax penalty it is wrong that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher end up paying higher taxes when they get married had they chose not to get married and just lived together their taxes would have been 1 400 less that is just wrong under the marriage tax elimination act we eliminate this marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacher in fact we do it by doubling the standard deduction we also double the brackets so that joint filers can earn twice as much as a single filer and remain in each bracket had the marriage tax elimination act been law today this machinist and schoolteacher would have seen the marriage tax penalty eliminated what is the bottom line in just a couple of weeks this house of representatives will be working to pass the tax provisions for this years balanced budget the 3rd balanced budget in 30 years thanks to a republican congress i believe as we work to provide tax relief as part of this balanced budget our first priority should be making the tax code fairer for this schoolteacher and this machinist by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i am pretty proud of what we have accomplished in 1996 we created as part of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit benefiting 3 million illinois children this year let us help married working couples let us help illinois families by

this well of the house over the last several years and that is a pretty basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes than an identical couple in an identical situation living together outside of marriage it is just wrong that under our tax code 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married is it right that under our tax code that couples are punished that they are penalized when they choose to participate in societys most basic institution that is the fact today i represent a diverse district on the south side of chicago in the south suburbs in cook and will counties in joliet and the bedroom and farm communities they all ask the same question they wonder why for 30 years now washington has punished marriage and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased that under the leadership of the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois this house has made it a top priority to eliminate and wipe out the marriage tax penalty suffered by 28 million married working couples the speaker has said that the elimination of the marriage tax penalty will be fast out of the box and on a fast track through the senate and to the president wiping out the marriage tax penalty and stopping the tax code from punishing marriage the marriage tax penalty really results from our very complicated tax code and unfortunately because we have a progressive tax code if couples get married they getpunished that is just wrong here is how the marriage tax penalty works here is how it ends up say there is a machinist and a school teacher in joliet illinois a machinist who works at caterpillar at the local plant the machinist makes that heavy equipment the big bulldozers and cranes and earthmoving equipment he makes 31 500 a year if he is single he pays taxes in the 15 percent tax bracket now if he meets a tenured public school teacher in the joliet public school system with an identical income as long as she is single she pays in the 15 percent tax bracket but if this school teacher and machinist choose to get married when they are married they file jointly and add together their income what happens then is their combined income is 63 000 and that pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and they are punished with an almost 1 400 marriage tax penalty if they chose to stay single and live together outside of marriage they would avoid that marriage tax penalty in this case because this machinist and school teacher chose to live in holy matrimony societys most basic institution they are punished under our tax code i find most americans whether they live in the city or the suburbs or the country think it is just wrong and they want congress and the president to do something about it that is why i am so pleased because i have a another couple from joliet illinois two public school teachers shad and michelle hallihan they came and told me they suffered a marriage tax penalty of 1 000 they just had a baby michelle told me congressman tell your colleagues in the congress that 1 000 average in marriage tax penalty is 3 000 diapers of course they point out that 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition in the local community college well house republicans are going to do something about this we are going to work to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and the speaker has put it on a fast track this wednesday tomorrow the house committee on ways and means will have committee action on legislation that will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those who suffer it we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles which will not only help 3 million couples who will no longer have to itemize 9h91 printed on recycled paper their taxes but will essentially wipe out their marriage tax penalty for those who do not itemize of course many homeowners itemize in order to help homeowners and those who itemize from suffering the marriage tax penalty we widen the 15 percent bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much as single filers and still pay in the 15 percent bracket and for lowincome families who benefit from the earned income tax credit we also provide marriage tax relief for poor families and lowincome families who suffer from the marriage tax penalty it is good commonsense legislation and deserves overwhelming bipartisan support there is no excuse to vote against legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty the speaker of the house has also indicated that by valentines day that we are going to pass this through to help couples like shad and michelle hallihan who suffer the marriage tax penalty and what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working couples than legislation which will eliminate the marriage tax penalty think in these terms 1 400 is a drop in the bucket here in washington it is chump change for the washington bureaucrats and the big spenders here in washington but back home in illinois a 1 400 marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at a local community college 3 months of day care for shad and michelle for their child it is several months worth of car payments it is most of the contribution to an ira for michelle it is real money for real people house republicans are making it a priority we invite the democrats to join with us let us make it a bipartisan effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working couples i urge my colleagues to pass the legislation with bipartisan support and send it to the senate and send it on the president i rise today to highlight what is arguably the most unfair provision in the unitedstates tax code the marriage tax penalty i want to thank you for your long term interest in bringing parity to the tax burden imposed on working married couples compared to a couple living together outside of marriage this month president clinton gave his state of the union address outlining many of the things he will spend the budget surplus on house republicans want to preserve 100 of the social security surplus for social security and medicare and use the nonsocial security surplus for paying down the debt and to bring fairness to the taxcode a surplus provided by the bipartisan budget agreement which cut waste put americas fiscal house in order and held washingtons feet to the fire to balance the budget while president clinton parades a long list of new spending totaling 72 billion in new programswe believe that a top priority after saving social security and paying down thenational debt should be returning the budget surplus to americas families as additional middleclass tax relief this congress has given more tax relief to the middle class and working poor than any congress of the last half century i think the issue of the marriage penalty can best be framed by asking these questions do americans feel its fair that our tax code imposes a higher tax penalty on marriage do americans feel its fair that the average married working couple pays almost 1 400 more in taxes than a couple with almost idential income living together outside of marriage is it right that our tax code provides an incentive to get divorced in fact today the only form one can file to avoid the marriage tax penalty is paperwork for divorce and that is just wrong since 1969 our tax laws have punished married couples when both spouses work for no other reason than the decision to be joined in holy matrimony more than 21 million couples a year are penalized they pay more in taxes than they would if they were single not only is the marriage penalty unfair its wrong that our tax code punishes societys most basic institution the marriage tax penalty exacts a disproportionate toll on working women and lower income couples with children in many cases it is a working womens issue let me give you an example of how the marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married working couples forexample a machinist at a caterpillar manufacturing plant in my home

higher taxes just because they are married it is wrong i believe and i know many in this house do believe that it is wrong that we punish societys most basic institution marriage with higher taxes that is just unfair let me introduce to my colleagues shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers from joliet illinois shad and michelle chose to get married a couple of years ago they are both in the workforce they just had a child this past year a new baby they pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1400 they knew that going into getting married that they were going to pay more in taxes but they chose to still get married i believe it is wrong they pay 1400 more in higher taxes in joliet illinois which is a south suburban community southwest of chicago 1400 for shad and michelle hallihan the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at joliet junior college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for their child it is just wrong they have to pay more in taxes just because they are married now the marriage tax penalty comes into play when two people marry and they are both in the workforce and have two incomes because under our tax code they file jointly which means they combine their incomes so in the case of shad and michelle had they chose to stay single and just live together they would each file as singles and they would each pay in the 15 percent tax bracket but because they chose to get married their combined income pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket so they get stuck with a higher tax bill just because they chose to get married now we believe in this house and it is clearly one of the top agenda items for house republicans that we should bring about some tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty i am proud that earlier this year every house republican and 48 democrats who broke with their leadership voted to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples unfortunately senator daschle and the senate democrats used parliamentary procedures to block action on that legislation and we have now had to go through the budget process or socalled reconciliation which is a word few people know the meaning of but it allows us to bring up a bill with a simple majority vote with that ability this week both the house and senate are going to be voting on legislation which will wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples now some on the other side and al gore and a few others say well lets give just a little bit of marriage tax relief so we can say we are for it al gore says we should only give marriage tax relief to those who do not itemize their taxes those who use the standard deduction well we want to help those who do itemize as well as those who do not itemize if you think about it most middleclass families most middleclass couples itemize their taxes because they are homeowners think about that if you are a homeowner those who oppose the bill we are going to be passing this week because they do not want to help homeowners and they do not want to help those who itemize taxes because they say they are rich only rich people own homes today according to al gore and other people well the bottom line is the only way we can help shad and michelle hallihan is if we pass the legislation we are going to pass this week legislation that doubles the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles so we wipe out the marriage tax penalty for those who do not itemize and then for those who do itemize such as homeowners or those who take the charitable deduction because they give to their institutions of faith or charity we also widen the 15 percent bracket to twice that for joint filers to twice that of singles that will eliminate essentially the marriage tax penalty for shad and michelle hallihan think about it if we eliminate the marriage tax penalty which we are going to vote this week to do for 25 million married working couples 50 million americans people like shad and michelle will have that extra 1 400 to take care of their child that is 3 months of daycare it is a years tuition at joliet junior college if they want to continue to improve their education i want to extend an invitation to my friends on the democratic side to join with us let us eliminate the marriage

accomplishments of this congress we balanced the budget the first time in 28 years we are now balancing it for the 4th year in a row we stopped the raid on social security just this past week sometimes i think my friends on the other side of the aisle have amnesia because we have already passed prescription drugs provided prescription drugs for our seniors we are paying off the national debt with a plan we have adopted by the year 2013 already paying down the debt by 350 billion and we are also working to make our tax code more fair particularly more fair for working and middle class families we have often asked in this house many of us a pretty basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes because they are married do we think it is right that 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married compared to identical couples with identical incomes who live together outside of marriage that is wrong we are fortunate that in february this house passed legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support legislation that was initiated by myself and the gentleman from indiana and the gentlewoman from missouri a democrat a bipartisan bill that had 233 cosponsors it passed this house in february with the support not only of every house republican but 48 democrats broke ranks with their leadership and voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples unfortunately in the senate the democratic leadership has used every parliamentary procedure possible to block this legislation we are now forced to move through the reconciliation process so that the majority can rule in the senate the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty it is wrong it is unfair let me introduce shad and michelle hallihan this is a photo of them when we introduced the bill a yearandahalf ago to wipe out the marriage tax penalty shad and michelle are two joliet township high school teachers they suffer the marriage tax penalty because they are both in the workforce and of course the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 that they suffer is a lot of money in joliet illinois the south suburbs of chicago 1 400 for michelle and shad hallihan that is a years tuition at our local community college joliet junior college which is our nations oldest it is also 3 months of day care for a child that is why i think it is important to introduce a new photo of shad and miohelle hallihan since they were married at the time that we introduced the legislation they have since had a baby and if al gore and my friends on the other side of the aisle had their way the child will probably be grown and out of college by the time we eliminate the marriage tax penalty shad and michelle have a little boy by the name of ben little ben has brought a lot of joy to their life but because of the marriage tax penalty there is 1 400 that goes out of the pocketbooks of shad and michelle and comes to washington money that they can use to take care of little ben and 1 400 that is about 3 000 diapers that is a lot of diapers for little ben over 18 years that 1 400 a year if they just set that full amount in a college fund that is over 25 000 that shad and michelle can invest in little ben and little bens future for college so the marriage tax penalty is real money for real people shad and michelle the way they suffer the marriage tax penalty is the marriage tax penalty occurs when you have a husband and wife who are both in the workforce they combine their income when they are married file jointly and when they combine their income that means they are pushed into a higher tax bracket if shad and michelle had chosen to stay single and just live together they each because of their income would file in the 15 percent tax bracket but they chose to participate in the most basic institution in our society which is marriage and shad and michelle because they are married now pay in the 28 percent tax bracket they suffer the marriage tax penalty we believe it is wrong we want to help michelle and shad hallihan as well as little ben to make sure he has a future and they have the resources for this under our bipartisan proposal we do several things we help those who do not itemize their taxes by doubling the standard deduction for joint filers at twice that of singles and that helps about 9 million couples of those who suffer the marriage tax penalty those are the nonitemizers well the rest subtracting 9 from 25 that leaves 18 million couples who itemize their taxes who suffer the marriage tax penalty and they are people who are average folks middle class but they probably own a house so if you own a home you probably itemize your taxes and the only way you can receive marriage tax relief is if we provide marriage tax relief as part of our proposal we do that by widening the most basic bracket the 15 percent bracket so you can earn twice as much in the 15 percent bracket if you are a joint filer as a single person and that is how we help michelle and shad hallihan as well as little ben prepare for his future by widening the 15 percent bracket i would also point out in our legislation that we provide marriage tax relief for those who participate in the earned income tax credit ensuring that they also participate and receive marriage tax relief we also protect those who use the child tax credit for the alternative minimum tax so we help both itemizers as well as nonitemizers poor working families and protect those from the amt i believe we need to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i want to thank my friends on the other side of the aisle particularly the 48 who joined with us and i invite more democrats to join with us in our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i would point out that under the democratic proposal michelle and shad hallihan would not receive any relief if one itemizes their taxes they would receive no relief under the democratic proposal if one is a homeowner and middle class and itemize your taxes you receive no marriage tax relief under the democratic proposal democrats say they do not want to help special interests so i guess they say if you are middle class and you own a home and you itemize your taxes you are stuck and you are still going to suffer the marriage tax penalty we have a bipartisan proposal that helps those who itemize primarily homeowners we help those who do not itemize we help those on earned income tax credit and we help those who may suffer the alternative minimum tax it is a good bipartisan proposal i urge adoption of this rule and i invite strong bipartisan support of our effort to eliminate the marriage

my constituents during the district work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools let us lower the tax burden for the middle class let us secure retirement by strengthening medicare and social security"]],

flexibility to local schools to do their job the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms and justifying their existence to the federal government i want them to be educating the children there and doing the job that really matters right now far too often they are filling out the forms and trying to qualify for the money and continually justifying what they axe doing we need to change that we need to shift to local control from one end of this country to the other exciting things are going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education

recognize two members on the house floor tonight the gentleman from california who is chairman of the house committee on rules has been a tireless advocate on behalf of the hightech industry i do not know of anyone who has worked harder invested more time and energy or is more responsible for the bill that we are considering tonight being on the house floor and i would like to congratulate him in advance on the expected passage of this bill second of all the gentleman from utah who just yielded me the time is an active member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims and he too has been a steadfast advocate of the hightech industry the gentleman from utah himself is an entrepreneur and he understands firsthand the needs of the hightech industry although there is still no objective credible study that documents the shortage of american hightech workers the ins said recently that the demand for highly skilled foreign workers is running at least 50 000 ahead of last year such a demand can indicate an actual shortage of american workers a spot shortage a preference for cheap labor or replacement workers or something else but because of the importance of the hightech industry to our economy i think we should give the industry the benefit of the doubt but giving hightech companies the benefit of the doubt is not without risk unless we safeguard american workers we need to recognize the opposition of the american people to an hlb visa increase two major polls demonstrate that the vast majority of americans do not want to see the number of hightech visas increased so much and worry that it will hurt american workers a peter hart poll conducted in march found that 73 percent of americans do not want to see immigration law changed to allow the entry of more foreign hightech workers only 20 percent wanted more foreign workers a harris poll released in september 1998 found that 82 percent of americans do not want to see the hlb quota increased the poll found that 77 percent of americans believe that an increase in hlb visas reduces employment opportunities for american workers and 86 percent of americans believe that unitedstates companies should train unitedstates workers to perform jobs in technical fields even if it is faster and less expensive to fill the jobs with foreign workers to satisfy the concerns of the american people we need to protect american workers from being undercut by foreign workers in the hlb program s 2045 contains no significant provisions to protect these american workers it does not require most companies to make a goodfaith effort to recruit unitedstates workers before hiring foreign workers it allows all but a small handful of firms to lay off american workers and replace the american workers with foreign workers why would anyone oppose these common sense safeguards what amazes me is that in all the discussions i have had with representatives of hightech companies not a single one has expressed any concern about the impact of this legislation on american workers how could anyone oppose a safeguard that says american workers could not be fired and replaced by a foreign worker how could anyone not agree to advertise for american workers before hiring from abroad how could anyone oppose paying foreign workers what the average beginning salary is for american college graduates unless they want to undercut american wages the committee on the judiciary passed a bill h r 4227 that contains an additional crucial safeguard for american workers the committee on the judiciary passed a bill that set a floor on wages for these workers 40 000 per year this wage is a good starting point for any hightech professional it is a salary that american students fresh out of college are making this crucial safeguard would prevent unitedstates companies from hiring foreign workers to undercut the wages of american workers strong antifraud measures are also necessary to address known abuses an article in last thursdays san francisco chronicle says it all federal authorities have started nationwide investigations into the hiring of foreign hightech workers including charges of visa fraud and allegations that the practice is riddled with abuse the chronicle quotes bill yates of the ins as stating but are we catching most of the fraud the truthful answer is that we are not if it is the intention of the employee or the employer to defraud the government you may not be able to ferret it out a justreleased government accounting office report states there is not sufficient assurance that ins reviews are adequate for detecting program noncompliance or abuse the program is vulnerable to abuse both by employers who do not have bona fide jobs to fill or do not meet required labor conditions and by potential workers who present false credentials the goals of preventing abuse of the program and providing efficient services to employers and workers are not being achieved evidence suggests that program noncompliance or abuse by employers may be more prevalent than under other laws any hlb bill should contain effective antifraud measures as are contained in the committee on the judiciarypassed h r 4227 s 2045 contains no such antifraud measures in return for giving hightech companies hundreds of thousands of more foreign workers all we ask on behalf of american workers is some minimal basic common sense safeguards to ensure that businesses do not want to hire cheap foreign workers at the expense of american workers while this bill has taken significant steps to alleviate the presumed shortage with more training for american workers such provisions will not yield benefits for many years supplying future workers is a different issue altogether from shielding

the republican party was founded on two fundamental issues free land and abolishing slavery since that day the party embraced the role of leader and never shied away from taking the challenge of taking an unpopular and difficult stance from striving successfully to abolishing slavery to being the vanguard in the struggle for womens right to vote the republican party has constantly forced all americans to reevaluate the role of individuals and the role of the government the republican party has always believed in individuals we have an abiding faith in the idea that individuals and local communities can accomplish more than a distant federal government a government that tends to become large bloated and wasteful as ours has as the great republican statesman abraham lincoln said the legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all or cannot so well do for themselves in their separate and individual capacities in all that people can individually do as well for themselves government ought not to interfere there is an important role for the government imagine an individual trying to build a freeway alone but it is a role that should be limited republicans believe the most effective government is closest to the people after all who knows more about educating our children us and our childs teacher or a distant bureaucracy across the country in washington d c i chose the republican party because i believe that each american citizen can be trusted i believe that they know best and that they will make the best decision for themselves and they will make the wisest choices whether it is how to spend their hardearned money or how to spend their time they should be in charge the republican partys economic policies of lower taxes and less government have reduced interest rates and sent the stock market soaring yet inflation has remained stable thanks to these smart policies every one of us is enjoying the largest sustained peacetime expansion ever our commonsense agenda and leadership has produced a healthy and strong economy job opportunities have increased significantly unemployment is down the budget is balanced and because of our welfare reform tens of thousands have moved from the welfarerolls to the payrolls i have to say while i firmly believe that all issues are womens issues and i resist the popular tendency to view women as a monolithic group in politics or anything else i still must emphasize the republican partys accomplishments with regard to women in politics i want to take membefs back to 1896 when it was the republican party who became the first major party to officially favor womens suffrage that year senator a a sargent a republican from california introduced a proposal in the senate to give women the right to vote it was defeated four times by a democratic senate and it was not until the republicans would gain control of congress that it was finally passed in may of 1919 the first woman to serve in congress was a republican jeanette rankin of montana in 1940 the republican party became the first major political party to endorse an equal rights amendment for women in its platform in 1953 republican president eisenhower appointed the first woman secretary of the department of health education and welfare and the first woman ambassador to a major power in 1964 republicans were the first major american party to nominate a woman for president senator margaret chase smith of maine in 1981 republican president reagan appointed the first woman supreme court justice and the first woman unitedstates representative to the united nations in 1983 republican president reagan had three women serving concurrently in his cabinet the first time in the history of this country currently republican women chair a record seven house subcommittees and three senate subcommittees i serve as a deputy majority whip along with two other women and as a newly elected vice chairman of the republican conference i am now the highest ranking woman in the house elected leadership the gentlewoman from ohio serves as conference secretary in the 106th

benefit package for all senior citizens or should we do what the republicans are talking about and that is find the poorest ones and say here is a little welfare program go on and down and register at the welfare office and you can get the drug benefit the president has proposed that we put a package that covers all senior citizens some of us are not very satisfied with the presidents plan because it is not very generous but at least at least it covers everyone for us to come out and pass a budget and say that in the last resort if we have a little money left after we have passed all these tax cuts we are going to give a little drug benefit that is simply not good public policy the senate has picked the number of 140 billion in tax cuts i personally think that is too much i do not think we need that i would rather pay down the debt however if they are going to do it let us take the conservative number in the senate the conservative number in the senate instead of this liberal wild spending on the republican side in the house and use that moneyto give a benefit for all senior citizens now when we go out and realize what the average senior citizen spends outofpocket my mother is a perfect example she lives on the minimum social security benefit along with 9 million other widows in this country 888 a month she spends 400 for where she lives and where she gets her food okay now she has 400 and she on average across this country is spending 200 a month 2 500 out of pocket for pharmaceutical costs in this country that is simply inexcusable we can fix it but it should be for all senior citizens because even those who have the benefit now because of the fact that they work for some company or they have the insurance policy or whatever at the moment may lose it and then where are they my view is that we should not drive seniors into poverty before we help them with their pharmaceutical costs any sensible person looking at the medicare program today would say the single biggest problem that we have not dealt with has been the issue of pharmaceutical costs i think that it makes sense to take the senate number the senate is not overly generous but at least we

option is a great step forward to allow people to get into a home that otherwise was not there the pilot program with that is great as well the transfer of unoccupied and substandard hud housing is something that has been long awaited because it needs to have that option if we are in fact going to clean up some of the neighborhoods that we have and clean up some of the homes the last thing i am appreciative of is the rural housing opportunities that were made andthat is very important to my district i do have some concerns about it and i would just take a moment to say that the gentlewoman from california has an amendment and if we combine her amendment with my second amendment what we do is to enlarge this pie to all americans to in fact go into these neighborhoods and create greater demand and greater assistance to raise the level of the neighborhoods i am hopeful as we debate that that we can talk about fairness and equal opportunity to all not just municipal employees and not just firefighters and not just policemen but the other significant members of the community including pastors because a spiritual component in any community is just as important as any other aspect in
