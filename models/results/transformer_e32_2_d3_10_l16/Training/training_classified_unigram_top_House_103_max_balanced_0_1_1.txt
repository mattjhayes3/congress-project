whitewater and they have heard about some of the mysterious things that have happened in the investigation into vince fosters death but there is a lot of other interesting things that have happened involving the rose law firm in little rock ar and hillary rodham clinton and the former governor of arkansas bill clinton tonight i would like to talk about two cases involving the failure of two savings and loans and the involvement of the rose law firm and some possible conflicts of interest that should be investigated by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation as well as the special counsel mr starr first american savings and loan of oak brook il was seized by the federal authorities for the federal government in 1986 first american savings and loan of oak brook was headed by former illinois gov dan walker dan lasater a friend of bill clinton had a brokerage business united capital corp and it traded treasury bond futures for first federal savings and loan of illinois and others dan lasater ran a brokerage firm in little rock ar he was a big contributor to bill clintons gubernatorial campaigns he was a friend of bill clinton and he flew clinton around in his private jet lasater gave roger clinton bill clintons brother a job and loaned him 8 000 to pay off a drug debt lasaters brokerage firm received a lucrative contract from the government of arkansas worth 750 000 to sell state bonds for a new arkansas state police communications network he also received millions of dollars in bonds for the arkansas development financial authority in 1986 lasater was convicted on drug charges this is bill clintons good friend he served only part of his sentence and he was pardoned after serving a small part of his sentence by then gov bill clinton in 1985 dan walker the former governor of illinois discovered that first american savings and loan was losing money big time on its treasury bond future trades with dan lasater according to court records mr walker lost approximately 361 000 walker claims that lasater made unauthorized trades with first federals money and walker told the chicago tribune they lasater co had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer at the time they made the trade and they did not do that walker sued lasater for 3 3 million for mail wire and securities fraud the suit charged that one of lasaters employees used first federals money to carry out what were in effect personal treasury bill trades does this sound familiar members heard me on the floor not long ago talking about a gentleman named dennis patrick from kentucky he had a similar story according to mr patrick in published accounts between 60 million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without mr patricks knowledge they traded 60 million to 107 million in bond trades in his account and he did not even know about it on 1 day 23 million was traded on his account without his knowledge now when federal regulators the fslic the federal savings and loan insurance corporation seized first american of illinois they continued to pursue the lawsuit against lasater they wanted to recover as much money as they possibly could dan walker the former governor of illinois was accused of lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured depositors money and later ended up being convicted of bank fraud and perjury hopkins sutter i know this is very complicated but hopkins sutter a chicago law firm was the primary contractor or law firm for the federal savings and loan insurance corporation hopkins sutter hired or subcontracted with a law firm in little rock ar called the rose law firm to handle the suit against lasater i hope everybody will think about this my colleagues lasater co mr lasater was a very close friend of bill clinton he flew around in his private jet they went on parties together lasater was convicted along with bill clintons brother of drug dealing lasater paid one of bill clintons brothers drug loans of 8 000 and after lasater was convicted he was pardoned by then gov bill cliiton rose law firm is hired as a subcontractor for the purpose of the suit against lasater they are going to go after lasater and hillary rodham clinton and vince foster were the two lawyers from the law firm the rose law firm to go after mr lasater think about that for a minute they are going after lasater for the federal government at the same time that he is a very good friend of gov bill clinton and has been pardoned for drug trafficking by the governor dan lasater was convicted of drug charges in 1986 as i said and served only a small part of his sentence and was later pardoned by the governor now president clinton now enter hillary rodham clinton rose law firms powerhouse lawyer and vince foster they handled the governments suit against lasater it is hard to believe this conflict of interest could occur but they are handling the case against lasater bill clintons friend because of the close ties between lasater and bill and hillary clinton she never should have been involved in this matter in any way that is a big conflict of interest in late 1987 a confidential settlement was reached between the government and lasater he ended up paying 200 000 of the 3 3 million suit that is all just 200 000 the chicago tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filings court records show that hillary rodham clinton and vince foster negotiated this settlement from 3 3 million down to 200 000 it started on may 8 1987 when hillary rodham clinton signed an amended complaint on this case that reduced the damages sought by the fslic against lasater from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million she negotiated the reduction of this down from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million for the fdic at a time when the guy lasater she was supposed to be nailing to the wall was a good friend of she and bill clinton the governor of arkansas the fdic said hillarys involvement tvas not extensive enough to constitute a conflict of interest this sounds like a whitewash by the fdic and to cover their tails the fdic said under federal rules existing at the time she did not have to inform the federal government about her close relationship with lasater and lasaters company the fdic said hillary worked only 3 houi s on the case they said she was not involved in the final decision to settle at 200 000 the fdic says vince foster did most of the work on this case he was her partner at rose the fslic that hired hillary and vince foster and the rose law firm could not remember details of the case the fdics earlier inquiry was primarily a review of court records and records submitted by the rose law firm the fdic did not interview i lary rodham clinton because of the apparent fdic wh wash in late february sena alfonse damato of new york questd the fdic acting chairm andrew hove to have the fdic insy tor general conduct a thorough rev of this matter and madison guarar hove asked the inspector general complete its investigation and relp to him in 90 days that was back february here we are in septem and the report has not yet come do now why why has the igs report come down it was demanded or quested by senator damato of senate banking committee and it supposed to be done in 90 days here we are almost a year later c months later and we have not hear thing i wonder if the white house anything to do with stopping that port obviously 90 days are over we still have no report on this case thomas scorza a former assist unitedstates attorney who teaches legal etl at the university of chicago i school said the following to the c cago tribune newspaper a lawyer is required to represent the in ests of their client zealously there is a i istantial question about whether an attor was representing a client zealously if the ponent of the client is someone with w the attorney has a political financial personal relationship and make no mistake about it i lary rodham clinton and bill clin had a very close relationship lasater and this was not made kn when hillary rodham clinton took that case in looking at the settlem he went on were they the rose law firm and hil rodham clinton looking after lasaters terests or the interests of the federal posit insurance corporation actually the federal savings loan insurance corporation scc told the chicago tribune that hill rodham clinton should not h worked on the case especially si the final settlement was confidentia william wernz a former chairmai the minnesota lawyers responsibi board for the minneapolis tribune s that the bar association model r define as conflict of interest instan where it is likely a lawyer might pull a punch because he or she some relationship with the other side some third party of interest law and accounting firms are usu barred from representing the federal c eminent in s l cases if they have per ally represented the s l or if they have sonal links to the persons targeted by lawsuit and that was specifically the case 4 lasater and company dan lasater a friend of bill clintons he conti uted generously to bill clintons c4 paign for governor he flew clin around in his private jet they had i ties together they went out toget all of the time dan lasater gave roger clinton a and loaned him a large sum of moi 1l to pay drug debts and after lasater was convicted on drug charges and ite served a small part of his sentence tor then gov bill clinton pardoned him re yet his wife hillary rodham clinan ton who knew lasater very well took ec the side of the government in the case iew against lasater reduced the settleity ment from 3 3 million down to 200 000 to and the fslic was literally screwed ort out of all of that money from 3 3 milin lion down to 200 000 there was defiber nitely a conflict of interest that she wn did not let the american people know not or the fslic know about re here is a related problem home fedthe eral savings and loan of centralia il was was also seized by federal regulators and home federals former president king ir 8 betz sued lasater and company for d a 4 6 million for unauthorized trading has he chose the rose law firm to handle re his suit and hillary rodham clinton and was a big partner in that law firm and he chose the rose law firm to handle ant his suit because the issues involved iics were similar to the issues in first aw american hi after the federal government took over home federal the federal govter ernment continued the case and they 3ub had the rose law firm carrying the ney case for them op thomas mars represented lasater on om the other side of the table against the and home federal federal government suit so you had on one side of the table hil the rose law firm of which hillary ton rodham clinton was a partner like the ith case i just cited and on the other side wn was this guy named thomas mars on now where did he come from he had ent previously worked at the rose law firm so you have on one side of the lary table negotiating for the federal govin ernment the rose law firm and you de have a former lawyer in that same law firm representing lasater does that and sound like some conniving some pecur liar circumstances mars had preary viously worked at the rose law firm ave where he had worked on the american nce suit he worked on the first american 1 suit that i just talked about therei of fore he may have had some inside inlity formation on the governments case said since the case he worked on at the iles rose law firm was very similar ces king betz the man who started the case ip the first place for home federal has savings and loan was advised by or vince foster of the rose law firm to ally accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlekov ment in september of 1989 and he 3on agreed to the settlement but he did per not know that both sides of the table the were being worked by the rose law firm and a former lawyer who worked ith for the rose law firm wras king betz says that vince foster was rib handling his suit and never told him am about mars potential conflict of interton est or the clintons ties to lasater ar according to the chicago tribune her when betz was told that mars previously worked with foster and hillary job rodham in the first federal case for hey the rose law firm betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information but the cat was already out of the bag or in the bag because he had already signed off on the 250 000 settlement on a suit that was supposed to be for 4 6 million there are some questions that need to be answered by the rose law firm and by the fslic and the fdic concerning these two cases first when will the fdic inspector general issue its report on hillary rodham clinton first american and madison guaranty is this report being delayed until after the election it was ordered in february was supposed to be done in 90 days and here we are in september 7 weeks before the election and we still do not have the report why that needs to be done quickly r0 1800 now here are some questions that need to be answered by the fdic and the new independent counsel mr starr if he is investigating this and i think he probably will and in full and complete congressional investigations and hearings did hillary rodham clinton and or the rose law firm inform the federal government of her and her husbands ties to dan lasater i do not believe she did but we need to know if she did this is regarding the first american if they did not inform the government of their ties to dan lasater then why did they not because it was obviously conflict of interest to what extent was hillary rodham clinton involved in the suits they said it was only 2 or 3 hours but she signed or got the agreement to reduce the suit from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million so she was very conversant with it and very actively involved in it specifically what role did hillary rodham clinton have in the final decision tosettle the suit for 200 000 down from the 3 3 million if she was involved how were her actions affected by her ties to dan lasater and lasater co who was responsible for handling the case hillary rodham clinton vince foster or both obviously they were both partners in the rose law firm there had to be a conflict there who decided who would handle this case if vince foster was handling the case why was hillary rodham clinton involved at all we do know for sure the fdic has said that hillary rodham clinton signed the amended complaint reducing the damages sought from 3 3 million to 1 3 million now involving the home federal case why was not king betz the chairman there told about thomas mars conflict of interest he was a former lawyer with the rose law firm defending lasater why was not betz told about the ties between the clintons and lasater was the fdic informed about any of this did thomas mars the former errfployee of the rose law firm use inside information to arseptember20 1994 co range a 250 000 settlement on an over 4 million original suit these are questions that need to be answered the more we get into the machinations of the clintons the more we find all kinds of chicanery from whitewater to madison savings loan to these two savings and loan institutions in illinois to the angel fire development in new mexico there are so many questions that need to be answered that is why we need full and complete congressional hearings not just the facade we saw with the committee on banking finance and urban affairs in the house just a few months ago the people of this country have a right to know if there is corruption in this government they have a right to know if hillary rodham clinton had a conflict of interest when she was representing these individuals for the fdic i mean her husband was the governor he was a friend of the man that she was supposed to be nailing to the wall and she reduced the claim from 3 3 million down to 200 000 there are all kinds of questions that need to be answered and the only way the people of this country are going to know the facts is for us to have complete and thorough congressional hearings and they need to be held as quickly as possible i commend to my colleagues the following february 3 1994 chicago tribune article the special prosecutor appointed to scrutinize the business dealings of the president and first lady will focus on their role in an ozark land development called whitewater but there is another case buried deep in court records that could prove equally troubling to bill and hillary rodham clinton particularly if robert fiske the republican special prosecutor and former unitedstates attorney in new york makes good on his pledge to publish a report on the clintons political and business relationships when the president was governor of arkansas in the 1980s it involves a court case the first lady helped settie when she was a highpowered lawyer in little rock and the government was trying to sort out the problems of a bankrupt illinois savings and loan the illinois s l case suggests that hillary clinton as a private attorney had a glaring conflict of interest as an attorney for the federal deposit insurance corp she helped negotiate a secret outofcourt settlement that ended the governments suit against a family friend and an influential benefactor of her husband but the political problems the case could pose for the president and his wife may go far beyond the narrow questions about the first ladys conduct as a lawyer which she defends as in whitewater the illinois case places the president and his wife once again in an association with an unsavory wheelerdealer who had strong personal ties to the clintons and even stronger financial ties to the clinton administration in little rock in whitewater the trouble stems from the clintons business relationship with james mcdougal the guiding force behind madison guaranty an arkansas savings and loan that went broke and cost taxpayers more than 47 million fiske will examine whether clinton or his gubernatorial campaign benefited from mcdougals favorable treatment by a state agency in arkansas when clinton was governor in the illinois case the problem stems from the clintons friendship with dan lasater a convicted felon whose highflying bond tradingfirm played a hand in the troubles of several savings and loans including first american savings and loan association an oak brook institution headed by another politician dan walker who was governor of illinois from 1973 to 1977 it all started in 1979 in an unlikely venuethe oaklawn park racetrack in hot springs ark clintons mother the late virginia kelley had a passion for thoroughbred horseracing and her box at the track was next to lasaters an arkansas native who grew up in poverty in kokomo ind lasater started a hamburger chain when he was 19 and was wealthy by the time he met mrs kelley and clintons halfbrother roger at the racetrack in just over twb decades lasater had sold his first hamburger chain moved to arkansas founded the ponderosa steakhouse a nationwide chain of 650 family restaurants started a bond trading firm and nurtured his love for horseracing the racetrack friendship soon blossomed into an introduction to clinton who was trying to regain the governors mansion after losing an election in 1980 according to a clinton family friend by early 1983 lasater had given roger clinton a job at his florida horse farm clinton had reclaimed the governors mansion and lasaters bond firm had been added to a list of brokerage firms eligible to underwrite state bond issues a classification that generated millions of dollars in business for his firm according to published reports over the next two years the ties between lasater and the clintons grew stronger the clintons benefited from the relationship lasater contributed money to the governors campaign lent roger clinton 8 000 to pay off a drug debt sponsored fundraising parties at his offices made his private plane available to the ambitious young governor for campaign jaunts and encouraged his staff to donate to the governors campaign promising higher commissions to compensate for the donations according to published reports at one point in 1985 he also made his plane available to squire celebrities to a charity function organized by hillary rodham clinton lasater benefited from the closer ties too in the summer of 1985 clinton successfully lobbied the arkansas legislature to approve a contract for lasater to sell 30 2 million in bonds for the new state police radio system the contract netted lasaters firm 750 000 according to a report in the los angeles times meanwhile lasater spread his financial wings beyond arkansas signing deals to trade treasury bond futures with several savings and loans including walkers first american the s ls were trying to compensate for their moneylosing mortgage lending operations by engaging in the highrisk deals being peddled by lasater but things began to sour in late 1985 both in illinois and in arkansas at first american walker discovered that lasaters bond firm didnt have the magic touch according to court records walkers s l lost at least 361 572 in tbond futures trades made by lasaters firm they had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer each time they made a trade walker said in a telephone interview they did not do that meanwhile law enforcement officers in arkansas had started picking up reports that lasater had another problem he was distrib h9297 uting cocaine to friends and business associ ates at swank parties he threw in little rock and hot springs walker struck first filing a 1985 suit against lasaters bond firm alleging that the company committed mail wire and securities fraud by using first american funds for unauthorized tbond futures trades walker never got lasater in court first american was seized in 1986 by federal officials who later charged the former illinois governor with lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured deposits walker was eventually convicted of bank fraud and perjury federal officials also collared lasater they convicted him of cocaine possession and trafficking in 1986 meanwhile the federal regulators who seized first american decided to pursue the savings and loans 3 3 million suit against lasater to see if they could recoup some money for american taxpayers who funded the billiondollar bailout of hundreds of bankrupt savings and loans including first american the governments deposit insurance fund hired the rose law firm in little rock where hillary clinton was a powerhouse rose had successfully solicited the governments legal work on failed savings and loans in arkansas months earlier the lasater connection caused no end of problems for gov clinton during his reelection campaign in 1986 clinton came under attack from his republican opponent for steering state contracts to lasater while lasater was under investigation for drug trafficking clinton acknowledged being friends with lasater but denied knowing about lasaters drug activities clinton was reelected in 1987 lasater went off to serve his prison sentence after giving patsy thomasson another key clinton supporter and democratic party activist legal authority to manage his assets according to court records most of the rose firms s l legal work was andied by webster hubbel now the no 3 official at the unitedstates justice department but the firm assigned the governments suit against lasater to hillary clinton and vincent foster who later became deputy white house counsel for president clinton and who committed suicide last july in late 1987 court records show hillary clinton and foster negotiated a confidential settlement lasater paid the government 200 000 in return for the dismissal of its 3 3 million suit against him whether lasater got off cheaply at the expense of the american taxpayer depends upon his assets at the time and the strength of the evidence against him legal experts say nevertheless thomas scorza a former assistant unitedstates attorney who teaches legal ethics at the university of chicago law school said hillary clintons decision to represent the government in a lawsuit against lasater raises serious questions about her professional conduct a lawyer is required to represent the interest of their client zealously he said there is a substantial question about whether an attorney was representing a client zealously if the opponent of the client is someone with whom the attorney had a political financial and personal r~lationship in looking at the settlement were they the rose law firm looking after lasaters interests or the interests of the fdic scorza asked hillary clintons office declined to respond to specific questions about the case but issued a general statement defending her legal ethics our view is that hillary clinton when a lawyer at the rose law firm acted with the utmost integrity and professionallsm i have no reason to believe otherwise said her press secretary lisa caputo to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest scorza said hillary clinton should not have worked on the walker s l caseespecially because the final settlement was confidential the tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filing theres no evidence in the court case that the rose law firm or hillary clinton ever disclosed to their client the fdic the ties between tie clintons and lasater or thomasson who was representing lasaters interests at the time of the settlement thomasson who later became executive secretary of the arkansas democratic party is now director of the white house office of administration david barr an fdic spokesman said fdic attorneys are trying to locate records on first american to see if the rose law firm notified the fdic about any potential conflict of interest a law firm can be banned from receiving further work from the fdic and the resolution trust corp which disposes the assets of failed s ls if it misleads fdic officials about a possible conflict of interest barr said the first american case isnt the only problem for the firm which hillary clinton left before her husband assumed the presidency the fdic is trying to determine whether the rose firm misled federal regulators about a potential conflict of interest when the firm represented the deposit insurance fund against the accountants who worked for madison guaranty hillary clinton had represented madison the savings and loan at the heart of whitewater in addition fdic officials are looking into the case of home federal savings and loan of centralia another failed illinois institution which is very similar to the first american case it is not known whether hillary clinton was directly involved in the home federal case the rose law firm represented home federal in a 4 6 million suit against lasaters company for unauthorized trading but what is unusual about this case is that lasater too was represented by an attorney with ties to rose king betz former president of home federal said he initially hired the rose law firm because the claims in his suit were nearly identical to those in the first american case he said that vince foster was the lead attorney in the case and that he had no contact with hillary clinton after the government took over home federal it continued the case meanwhile though thomas mars a rose attorney who had worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first american suit against lasater left the rose firm months later he started representing lasater against home federal which was still represented by rose legal experts say the rose law firm should have notified betz and the fdic ab6ut mars potential conflict of interest because mars worked on the first american suit he could have had inside information that gave him an advantage in negotiating a settlement for lasater in the home federal suit betz says foster never told him about lasaters ties to the clintons he also failed to advise betz about mars potential conflict of interest betz said foster advised him to accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlement in we were told by the attorneys that we were not going to get any more money said betz who agreed to the settlement when told that mars had previously worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first federal case betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information mars denied any wrongdoing tnere was nothing funny going on everything was always on the up and up everything was done in a businesslikemanner he said"],

tonight there is nothing more frustrating here than having to interrupt your thoughts as the clock is chasing you i want to continue what i have just loosely called the clinton years part 3 and begin tonight with something from yesterdays wall street journal that i found very disturbing it is a description of the fine state of arkansas that matches something i tried to describe in this well in september and in october of the election year 1992 there is a newsletter that has just come into my possession by kevin phillips published by the american political research corporation it is called the american political report the headline is whitewater the politics of a second watergate when you say this to anyone in the dominant media culture who is a gentleman and admits they are liberal a lady of the same honor and they are rare most of them claim that they are perched on some olympian peak of moderate perfection when you mention in the same breath whitewater or watergate or refer to whitewater as white watergate as does the great columnist for the new york times bill safire they go ballistic on you here are some of the subtitles in kevin phillips american political report clinton whitewater and the polls and the polls are moving severely against mr clinton the clinton scandals a 20th century political perspective i will come back to that the hillary rodham factor the clinton scandals in the midterm elections that is a fascinating part 4 june congressional hearings on whitewater it may be a lot sooner than june after what happened in this house today by a vote of 408 to 15 the house of representatives the peoples great chamber has joined that 98 to 0 vote in the unitedstates senate to start hearings as soonas possible six clinton legal vulnerabilities this is a nightmare for the white house obstruction of justice shredding of evidence intimidating or offering payment to witnesses or offering promotions jobs to arkansas troopers which was not mentioned in

as one columnist observed a modified hangout watergate term stunned by more bad news the president tries to change the subject tonight on all three networks particularly on cbs they devoted about 10 minutes on the cbs show to all of the various whitewater stories breaking today on abc they described the vote of this house today to hold hearings as the democrats conceded to and then the reporter took a deliberate dramatic pause and said to do the best we could because we do not have specific dates yet or anything really substantial on whenwe are going to have the hearings the los angeles times which remember has 4 of the arkansas 10 troopers that were talking 4 on tape recording here is the l a times of yesterday a story correctly predicting what would happen today in little rock exmunicipal judge accused of fraud tries to implicate clinton david hales trial begins next week in a case related to whitewater of course he plea bargained today interesting that the unitedstates attorney down there in little rock paula casey could have had him plea bargain months ago this all would be much further advanced maybe some of it is resolved to the clintons satisfaction if she had not stonewalled former judge david hales offer to plea bargain and tell all and then after she had stopped him and demanded that he go to trial then she recused herself as having a biased background on the whole whitewater mess here is todays l a times clinton treasury aide given early briefing on failed arkansas thrift political appointee roger altman was told that the madison guaranty s l case would go to the justice department he is also a regulator raising a possible conflict beneath that another story republicans had planned to raise the whitewater issue at hearings on thursday chairman

we do not know if that 408 to 15 vote today is going to grow into a select panel but if it does it will be more of a jungle out there for the white house as a matter of fact when i pick up the papers these days an old beatles tune always rings in my head i saw the news today oh boy now here is the wall street journal yesterday rose law firm will file ethics complaint in arkansas about hubbells expenses that is webster hubbell best golf buddy of bill clinton the rose law firm has decided to file a complaint with the arkansas ethics authorities about undocumented expenses incurred by former associate attorney general webster hubbell how can they blame that on the republicans of course they cannot it is impossible as i said in my special orders last week walk out the hall here a few steps to the statutory hall which was the house chamber for 50 years from 1807 to 1857 and statue number 7 around to your left in between jeffersn davis the senator from mississippi who became the president of the 10 breakaway confederate states and on the other side is robert fulton of steamboat invention fame and there is one of the two statues from arkansas that every state is allowed to put in this incredible building the worlds greatest governmental building ever there is the distinguished face and form of uriah rose the founder of the rose law firm an appointee to the geneva convention at the turn of the century around 1908 by 1908 president teddy roosevelt was the first president of the american bar association and that rose firm was the first firm west of the mississippi when arkansas was just a frontier state it is really tragic what has happened to the 60 partners down there now that they are going to find themselves possibly as some columnists suggest in a state of bankruptcy within months what a tragedy that the four partners coming to washington what is now being called the gang of four hillary rodham webster hubble vince foster dead since july 20 and now william kennedy william kennedy hi no relation to the massachusetts kennedy family here is the wall street journal article from today kennedy clintons ethics gatekeeper hasnt paid taxes on nannys wages before white house associate counsel william kennedy 3i became a clinton gatekeeper on ethical issues he worked for nussbaum who has resigned under a cloud who had on his desk a parody of james carville clintons campaign managers theme sign about staying on message it is the economy stupid and nussbaum had on his desk it is the ethics stupi that sign must have fallen on its face when they were all conducting these midnight raids into vince fosters office it says kennedy became a clinton gatekeeper on ethics yet he had a hidden problem of his own unpaid taxes owed on a nannys wages but he disclosed it to only one person in the clinton camp surprise surprise vincent foster the deputy white house counsel who died july 20th notice very few of the papers say committed suicide they say alleged suicide or who died i may be naive but i am still clinging to the theory of suicide because anything else is so shakespearian i will be on this floor if there is ever a murder or even an indication of the body being moved i will be on this floor calling for the resignation merciful resignation of the clinton team from the white house that is for sure here is the headline of the distinguished washington times gonzalez gives in calls for hearings hale might hold pieces to the whitewater puzzle grand jury likely to hear of clintons depis it is interesting that hale might be the john dean of this breaking scandal the first one who comes forward and tells all to save himself dean went to jail it looks like hale if going to jail for 10 years maybe with good behavior he will get 5 but this thing grows exponentially here is a column i meant to put in the record from last week when i spoke on st patricks day and the following day in defense of arkansas it says it is time to come to thedefense of arkansas recently maligned with an image of a closeknit political circle of mutual back scratching in this department little rock as nothing on washington dc with webb hubble leaving the justice department jamie gorelick is about to arrive ms gorelicks nomination which went before the senate last week was fascinating because of all the people she has defended clark clifford and robert altman not roger no relation i believe i had better check that out on the first american bank where they worked when it was secretly owned by the bank of credit and commerce international or bccl one of the largest banking scandals in this country guess what i found out who writes these fascinating articles in the wall street journal it is robert bartley he was unflappable on meet the press sunday before the guns of david broder and company he has said to folks that since mlichael kingsley and others accused him on nightline excuse me on crossfire and in print in the new republic that he was one of the proximate causes of a suicide namely vince foster that he said what do these people expect me to do dry up and blow away or to defend my honor here is an article that i think is going to be probably the most quoted over the next months from what i have always goodnaturedly called a schizophrenic magazine because most of the reporters are liberal like michael kingsley and yet fred barnes is one of its senior editors and that is the new republic wait until i read what the new republic says about the scandals interlocking in arkansas by l j davis here it is so powerful it is quoted in a long editorial the longest i have seen yet in any paper in the wall street journal obviously written by robert bartley and i will cut to the chase here and read the part that fascinated me because i had said the same thing on the house floor over 1 year and 7 months ago arkansas mr davis l j davis writes in the new republic a liberal moderate magazine there is a close resemblance to a third world country with a ruling oligarchy a small and relatively powerless middle class a disenfranchised leaderless populace the wall street journal says this kind of civic culture we see in many actual third world countries i have witnessed it all through the torments of central and south america over many trips down there when i was on the committee on foreign affairs a decade ago we see this kind as likely to produce a spoilstothevictor abovethelaw approach to government that is to say the kind of careless arrogance we have seen in the handling of whitewater in the white house passes in webb hubbles law firm billings in travelgate in intervention into an ongoing corruption trial in the handling of vince fosters death and in the handling of various individuals including zoe baird kimba wood lannie gunier and chris emory a white house usher dismissed over phone conversations with barbara bush over how to set up her computer home laptop computer with no warning and less than a weeks notice chris emory longtime white house usher turned into the street whitewater is not merely about a land deal the wall street journal continues it is about all of these things and about the place they are bidding the clintons to assume in washington which god knows is guilty of enough sins of its own and above all it is about hypocrisy say that one after another the explanations are innocent hilary was lucky in commodities and unlucky in land speculation wishing they had lost money jim blair and patsy thomason are just friends she was on the hill today more about that later james and susan macdougal and david hale and dan lassiter are just former friends lay aside all suspicions and accept every cover story we are now supposed to believe that bill clinton was elected president to reform the sins of the highflying 1980s yes the key word there is hypocrisy here is something that my friend senator doi nickles sent over he is chairman of the senate republican policy committee as i have been chairman for 2 years over here a few years ago of the republican study committee he sent over documentation that i would like to include in the record at this point about all of the 25 separate allegations of ethical or legal wrongdoing that were turned into hearings and or investigations during the reagan and bush administration despite the presence of at least five separate instances or allegations of wrong during the clinton administration and senator nickles lists them congress has yet to conduct a single hearing or the slightest investigation on three occasions during the reagan administration congressional committees conducted investigations or hearings concurrent with investigations by an independent counsel four of 19 congressional hearings or investigations conducted during the reagan administration were led by the thenrepublican controlled committees of the united states senate which was from 1981 through 1986 under republican control a recent opinion

their offices are listening they ought to get over here on this floor and watch because the american people are watching and you are about to witness one of the most outrageous charades ever attempted on the floor of this house here are 432 pages of testimony of conscientious members of this house republicans and democrats who have been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership 40some denied their rights on the floor of this house you are about to see the taxers the spenders the regulators who control this house the democrat leadership attempt to convince you and the american people that the bill that pays for the operation of this congress has been substantially reduced i get so exercised when i see this mr speaker and members that is an outrageous charade this bill does not reduce spending on we the congress it does not reduce spending by 20 percent by 10 percent by 5 percent not even 2 percent this bill authorizes spending on we the congress of 1 800 000 000 almost 2 billion and yes the taxers and the spenders and the regulators who run this place have magnanimously cut this legislative budget by about 1 percent well isnt that big of them what do you think about that mr and mrs america typically president clinton and the democrat leadership are attempting to foist on the american people the largest tax increase in american history forcing each american family to cough up at least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse through this gag rule refusing to let rankandfile republicans and democratsand here they are democrats look at them you have been slapped by your democrat leadershiprefusing to allow republicans or democrats to even offer amendments that would significantly cut our legislative budget why is this a charade it is a charade because the democrat leadership in an 11thhour rules meeting yesterday kidded 40some members democrats and republicans alikehere they arewho came to us pleading to let them offer significant cutting amendments to the bill why is this a charade mr speaker because after listening to all of these members recite what their constituents were saying back home cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending the democratcontrolled rules committee turned down on a partyline vote all 46 of the significant cutting amendments offered by republicans and democrats alike amendments that would have cut several hundred million dollars from this bloated legislative expense budget that continues to hire 37 000 employees which i think is lust to make us look good why is this a charade mr speaker because after refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually or in total significantly reduce this legislative budget to show you what a charade this gag rule really is and why i am so exercised and why the american people are going to be so exercised if all six of these amendments pass all six that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that continues to raise their taxes so that they can spend the money on themselves that is exactly what we are doing here they have had it with a congress that continues to pass laws that regulate the american people but exempt the congress exempt themselves they have had it with you they have had it with a democrat leadership that refuses to allow rank and file republicans or democrats to offer amendments that would do what their constituents sent them here to do this year cut spending cut spending cut spending i cannot say it enough cut spending especially cut spending on themselves mr speaker and members i urge defeat of the rule so that democrats like the gentleman from minnesota a good conservative democrat most conscientious member on your side of the aisle and another democrat the gentleman from utah another very good member who has been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership and refused to be able to come on this floor and offer their significant amendments that would cut millions out of this budget and lord knows we can afford to cut millions out of this budget so that our republican leader the gentleman from illinois could offer his amendment which could cut anywhere between 12 and 25 percent you know they deserve the right to be able to come to this floor and do that mr speaker and members of this house that is what the american people want but it is what the democrat leadership does not want members who are you for are you for the democrat leadership or are you for the american people on behalf of the american people vote down this rule and let these members come on this

there has been a tentative agreement forced upon the republican party in this congress on the whitewater investigations what has happened is the democrat majority has said the only way we are going to have hearings in either the house or the senate is if it is very structured and very limited they want to limit it to three things the death of vincent foster the removal by the white house personnel immediately after his death of files from his office and white house attempts to influence the resolution trust corporation investigation of mr and mrs clintons role in the arkansas s l but the investigation by the house and the senate should be much much broader i wantto tell my colleagues whr first of all there are questions about mr fiske the special prosecutors objectivity mr fiske was a very close associate at various times when theywere both in new york practicing law with bernie nussbaum one of the chief advisers to president clinton as a matter of fact mr fiske the special prosecutor special investigator in this case tried to get mr nussbaum appointed assistant counsel during the irancontra investigation mr fiskes law firm represented the international paper co which got a 10 million loan from the arkansas development finance authority in arkansas his firm also represented the international paper co during the time when they sold hundreds of acres to the whitewater development corp mr fiske recommended louis freeh now head of the fbi to be the head of the fbi to mr nussbaum at the white house so there is some question about whether there will be complete thoroughness on the part of mr fiske and his staff in investigating the white house allegations but beyond that there is a lot of other things that need to be investigated because more and more is coming out daily first of all why did thengovernor bill clinton pardon a convicted cocaine dealer dan lasater in 1990 dan lasater pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in december 1988 but he served only 6 months of a 2 2year sentence while he was reportedly under investigation by the arkansas state police for drug dealing president clinton and the government of arkansas gave him 664 million in bonds to sell for the state which garnered him 1 6 million in commissions why did thengovernor bill clinton pardon copvcted cocaine dealer dan lasater in 1990 after all this involvement with him and they gave big contributions to clintons campaign he is thenpardoned for cocaine trafficking was it because dan lasater was a large contributor was it because dan lasater had flown the governor around arkansas and the country in his private jet was it because dan lasater gave roger clinton president clintons brother a job at his florida horse stables and loaned him 8 000 to pay back a drug debt did bill clinton know about the lasater investigation and lasaters drug use at the time he gave him 664 million in state bonds to sell according to published accounts and mr dennis patrick between wo million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without his knowledge that may have involved laundering of drug money one day 23 million was traded in his account patsy thomasson the chief personnel officer at the white house was running lasater co she was chief financial officer at the time now she is special assistant to the president of the united states where did this money come from where did it go did ms thomasson know about these transactions i do not know how she could not have there are of course other things that need to be explained in 1985 the arkansas development finance authority was created by bill clinton to provide economic development loans to small businesses in arkansas a number of serious questions have been raised about adfa which need to be investigated listen to this on december 29 1988 adfa deposited 50 million in a bank in the cayman islands why are you taking money out of the state of ar kansas and putting it in the cayman islands this money was transferred through simmons first national bank of pine bluff ar why did adfa deposit 50 million in an offshore bank instead of a bank in some other part of the country or in arkansas the interest rates were approximately the same the state departments international narcotics control report described the cayman islands as a haven for the laundering of drug money and here is the arkansas development finance authority sending 50 million down there was the 50 million plus interest repaid to adfa right now we do not have any documentation as to whether it was ever repaid we do not know what happened to it did the arkansas development fixiance authority make any other offshore deposits and for what reasons public documents show that adfa was steering millions of dollars in bond underwriting business to lasater and his company who i said before was convicted for drug dealing why would adfa give all of this business to lasater co while dan lasater the companys president was under federal investigation for narcotics trafficking i the american people need to knowthe answers to these questions and we are very very concerned that mr fiske may limit the investigation so that we never get the answers if somebody at the white house was involved in the laundering of drug money then we should have a full accounting it should be explained to this body and to the american people and if there is no reason to believe that then why does not the white house patsy thomasson and everybody else come forward mr fiske and give us the ability to investigate it so we can clear up this whole matter if there is nothing to hide they should not be concerned"], [0.002741341944783926, 0.002741341944783926, 0, "there has been a remarkable erosion of support among middle americans that is to say americans of middleincome for the clinton health care bill and for the clinton health care bill in its legislative form in the other body where it is the clintonmitchell bill and in the house where it is the clintongephardt bill the same phenomenon occurred last year during consideration of the clinton tax bill during the 1992 campaign as a candidate he talked about middleclass tax cut but in fact we know how quickly that evaporated once we got down to brass tacks instead this congress pushed through the biggest tax increase in american history one that directly impacted the middle class for example seniors receiving social security making 14 000 got a 70percent effective rate increase on their social security benefits that is how much their income taxes went up on social security benefits that recordbreaking tax increase passed by the congress will pale in comparison to the clintongephardt bill that we are likely to take on here in the house although it is difficult for us to talk about it as members of congress because while we have looked at the press releases and press statements about the bill we are still waiting we are still waiting for a bill even though we are just days away from adjournment and the congress hopes to act on health care before we adjourn but we do not have a bill the congressional budget office has not been able to give us an estimate of how much precisely in the way of new taxes the bill contains and precisely how much in the way of new spending the bill contains we simply have not read it this is more than a trivial point health care comprises oneseventh of our nations economy it is also on a more personal level a matter of life and death for every american one would think that a new health care plan prescribed by the federal government for the whole country would therefore be the most carefully studied document since the constitution but instead when as and if this congress and house get around to seeing and voting on a bill we are going to find that members have not had a chance to read it that in fact when we vote members will know more about o j simpsons blood type than they will about the content of our own health care legislation but we operate necessarily in an environment of uncertainty we do not have a bill but we must debate what it is we anticipate because after all the vote will be upon us and that will be it and we will have an election we must adjourn at some point and that point is arriving rather quickly why are people skeptical of what they have been seeing the heritage foundation did an analysis of the clintongephardt bill as it was released what they found is that the ew taxes and there are many of them in the clintongephardt bill would amount to 42 6 billion in the first full effective year of the plan in 1999 on top of the current costs on the system people who are saying these new taxes are only going to displace existing health care costs or somehow limit the growth of health care costs must face this fact 42 6 billion in new taxes will be imposed by the clintongephardt health care bill on top of our current estimates for how much the existing system is going to cost now the average additional tax burden per individual as a result of the clintongephardt bill according to the heritage foundation is 430 per individual on average the clintongephardt bill unquestionably is going to offer americans less choice it does not quite do justice to the fact to say less almost none compared to what presently an insured american has available congress and the federal government are going to prescribe a standard health care plan and that is going to be the norm for the country like it or not if your existing plan is different than the standard plan if you continue to get those benefits you will pay a tax not only will you pay a tax but your employer will pay a tax the new taxes imposed by the clintongephardt bill are going to be split 80 percent by the employer and 20 percent by the individual so 20 percent of these new taxes will come directly out of the paycheck of the american worker there will be far more bureaucracy in this plan because for a substantial part it is going to rely upon something called medicare part c medicare part c is in effect a governmentrun insurance plan that will extend together with the existing medicare program to over half the entire population or to about half the entire population according to our best estimates half of the american people at that point will be getting their health care from a government plan as compared to the current system the more americans learn it seems the more likely they are to realize that instead of providing americans with greater health security the clinton gephardt plan clinton mitchell plan over in the other body and whatever congressional cousins are aboard or are just now being written in so many different staff offices will create greater uncertainty especially for middleincome americans middleincome americans will pay more in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both quantity availability of health care and the quality of that care why will they be paying more in premiums we discussed why they pay more in taxes under the clinton gephardt bill why pay more in premiums because of the community rating system that is where factors like age cannot be taken into account senior citizens incur about 4 timeson average in the way of health care costs as younger working americans if you are under 45 years old you will have a steep increase in your health care premiums under a community rating system so for all americans under 45 years old the clinton gephardt plan the clinton gephardt health care plan is going to represent a big increase in premiums on top of the payroll tax increase it is not surprising then that the strategy of the democrat leadership is to in the words of senator rockfeller pass health care regardless of the views of the american people i would hope we would not handle it that way i do hope instead of a legislative version of blindmans bluff we will get at least 30 days to read any health care bill that will come forth for a vote"], [0.002783925738185644, 0.002783925738185644, 0, "today i rise to express my opposition in the strongest terms to the proposal being offered today by bill clinton and the democrat majority in congress the budget proposal offered by the democrats is a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster it proposes to increase taxes at a time when americans are already overtaxed it proposes to increase taxes at a itime when we have a fragile economy higher taxes will only stifle job creation and economic growth it proposes to continue the path of excessive govemnment spending excessive spending is the reason our federal government is currently saddled with a massive debt depending on whose estimates you believe bill clinton is proposing to raise taxes anywhere from 250 billion to 315 billion no matter which figure you use if his proposal becomes law it will be the largest tax increase in the history of our nation moreover egardless of the exact figures his proposal taxes everyone from the small business owner to the social security recipient to the working middle income american family and we thought mr clinton was only going to sock it to the rich it is an absolute outrage that a man who actually promised middle american taxpayers a tax cut during the campaign can now turn around and unblushingly pr6pose to raise taxes in a magnitude of historic proportions mr clintons assertion that the reason he must now raise taxes is because the deficit figure is higherthan he anticipated during the campaign is quite frankly bull in fact last july during the campaign clinton predicted even higher deficitsup to 40u billionthan actually materialized moreover democrat budget committee members advising clinton during the campaign and working with their good friends at the congressional budget office certainly were well aware of what to expect in the way of deficit figures most conspicuous among those members is leon panetta former chairman of the housebudget committee and now clintons director of office of management and budget for clinton to rationalize raising taxes based on claims of new deficit figures is the height of hypocrisy this is just another example of mr clinton trying to be slick more importantly regardlessof what the actual deficit figures are t is excessive spending not insufficient tax revenues that has produced our gushing red ink indeed when you combine federal state and local taxes you find that the american taxpayer is already being taxed at alltime record high levels analyzing the federal budget over the past 12 years further drives home thepoint in 1980 revenues to the federal treasury were 500 billion by 1992 revenues had soared to 1 1 trillion a massive 600 billion increase in 12 years in other words in 12 years the american taxpayer shouldered an additional federal tax burden that was greater than the magnitude of the entire tax burden it took us over 200 years to reach one would think that the federal government could do just fine with 600 billion in new tax dollars each year but alas it isnt enough to quench the insatiable thirst of democrats in congress during that same timeframe federal expenditures rose frem 600 billion to nearly 1 4 trillionan increase of 800 billion this simply illustrates the historical fact that for every new dollar the treasury receives in taxes congress spends 1 60 more indeed the 1990 budget deal which had promised spending cuts for every dollar in new taxes instead resulted in congress spending an additional 2 37 for every dollar in new taxes republicans have been willing to make the hard choices and make the spendlng cuts how many times in the past 12 years have i seen this congress on a party ing vote reject republican amendments to trim as little as 1 percent from an appropriation bill how many times have i seen the democratcontrolled rules committee decide to prevent republlcant from offering amendments to cut spending and make economies indeed in that regard i was deeply disappointed that the democrats did not allow my good friend from indiana congressman dan burton to offer his budget freeze proposal i have long been an advocate of an across the board spending freeze mr burrons proposal would have made a bigger dent in the deficit than any of the proposals before us today moreover in my view mr burtons acrosstheboard freeze is the fairest way to spread the burden of spending cutseveryone who benefits from federal spending must tighten the belt however once again in an abuse of their uninterrupted control of the house of representatives for the past 40 years the democrats decided to gag the opposition rather than debate a viable alternative on its merits republicans have proposed viable alternatives and the budget proposal offered by my good fmlend john kasich is the kind of proposal that the american public deserves it proposes no tax increases and will cut the deficit significantly i can only hope that there are democrats in the house that can see the error of mr clintons ways and join republicans in supporting the kasich budget

bob dornan of california about some new revelations into whitewaterrelated activities as reported today in the washington times and i would like to expand a little bit on the story and i hope everybody will bear with me a little bit because it is a very convoluted involved story that leads everyone who knows something about it to believe that there needs to be a complete congressional investigation involving whitewater as well as possible drugrelated transactions a fellow named jerry seper of the washington times wrote and i am going to quote the first paragraph whitewater madison investigators are looking at a little rock investment firm owned by a convicted cocaine dealer to find out if drug profits were laundered through banks and other financial outlets and later masked as campaign contributions to arch governor bill clinton now what he is talking about here and i will jump through a lot of this is a fellow who is named dan lasater mr lasater is a businessman who is very successful he started a company called lasater co and mr lasater has been involved in business down in arkansas for a long time now mr lasater was a major contributor financial supporter of bill clinton as well as a personal friend throughout much of bill clintons political career during the time that bill clinton was governor and running for reelection as i said mr lasater gave him major contributions and major financial support mr lasater in 1986 was indicted and convicted of dealing in drugs and he received a 30month jail sentence he was believed to have been involved in not only drugs but laundering drug money at the same time bill clintons brother was involved in this alleged scheme and he was convicted as well mr lasater did not go to prison he spent 4 months in a halfway house and then i think he had 2 months under house arrest and then in 1990 bill clinton pardoned mr lasater and mr lasater after being pardoned became the chairman of the board of the phoenix mortgage co at that time a lady named patsy thomasson who had been associated with mr lasater and bill clinton she was also at that time in the late eighties and early nineties head of the democrat party in arkansas miss thomasson was the executive vice president of the lasater co and when mr lasater was indicted and convicted she took over as the chief executive officer and ran the company in his absence when mr lasater was pardoned by bill clinton miss thomasson became the president of the phoenix group so she was an associate of mr lasater before during and after his conviction for drug crimes now mr lasater while he was being investigated by the state police of arkansas for being involved in cocaine trafficking received a 664 million bond contract from the state of arkansas signed by the governor and he made 1 3 million off of this transaction this was during the time he was being investigated and later convicted for drug trafficking now a fellow named dennis patrick who was county court clerk in kentucky and this is a convoluted story so please bear with me it is hard to follow was contacted by an old schoolmate named steven love and mr love worked for mr lasaterin his brokerage house in arkansas mr love had gone to school with mr patrick and they were close friends he called ir patrick and said he wanted to take him on a fishing and hunting trip all eipenses paid on a private jet to an exotic place he was going to tell him how he could make a lot of money mr patrick went with him during the trip mr love told him that he was going to try to help him to set him up and help him make at least 20 000 a month from bond transactions mr patrick thought this was very interesting but he did not think anything would come of it a month later mr love called him and told him he had made 20 000 and he ought to come down to arkansas to visit him and the lasater firm because he had been the beneficiary of this 20 000 he had not invested anything he had not signed anything but he thought if i made 20 000 i would even get on skates and go down there he went down to arkansas mr love called over to the first american bank to somebody he knew over there and told them that he was sending mr patrick over there and they were opening up an account for 20 000 for him mr patrick went over and signed some papers opening up this account after that subsequent to that mr lasaters firm started running through patrick associates dennis patricks company bond transactions these bond transactions ultimately over the next 2 years 3 years amounted to between 60 and 107 million mr patrick did not know anything about them he did not know anything about them until later when two of the principals in the agency of the lassister co came to visit him and left him with some documents that he did not understand they were bond transactions these bonds were transferred without his approval and nobody knows where the money came from to buy the bonds and the 107 million was transferred to the security pacific bank branch in new york and first american bank inlittle rock mr patrick did not know anything about it he did not know where the money came from he did not know who bought the bonds but he did find out subsequently that these transactions had taken place and the money went into mr lasaters account i mr lasater as i said went to jail patsy thomasson was the chief financial officer for that company so that she had to know about these financial transactions patsy thomasson for those who do not know is now the director of the presidents administration at the white house she runs the white house today she is the lady that was the executive officer running this company or in large part during the time that this 197 million in bond transactions took place it is very possible very possible that this money was drug money that was being laundered through buying unitedstates treasury bonds and then sold through these two banks security pacific bank and first national first american and the money was then going into mr lassiters account we believe we think that it is real possible very possible that patsy thomasson knew about these transactions she is one of the lead principles in the white house the director of administration running the clinton white house we think that this alone is reason enough to have a congressional investigation there is so much involved in this that it almost becomes hard to follow my colleagues and i have been working on this all day long but i would like to show to my colleagues copies of the transactions that took place these bond transactions that took place in 1985 and 1986 they just came to the attention of the media and the congress today they are related to the entire whitewater scandal this congress needs to have hearings on this we know there is an investigation going on with the special counsel many are concerned that this is not going to get the complete hearing that it should with the special counsels investigation we are not trying to impugn the integrity of the special counsel we do believe he had close ties mr fiske had close ties and has had close ties with mr nussbaum who used to be at the white house we know that for a fact because they had legal dealings together on a number of cases we know mr fiske represented the international paper co and international paper sold several hundred acres to the whitewater development corp mr fiske is investigating all of this in order to make sure that mr fiske does his job properly as well as the congress does its job in conducting its oversight requirement under the constitution we believe that congressional investigations are absolutely necessary here is a man who was convicted of dealing in drugs here is a man who was pardoned by the nowpresident of the united states here is a man who during the time he was under investigation by the arkansas state police got 664 million in state bond contracts from which he made 1 3 million here is a man who was very close to the president of the united states was a major major contributor and went everyplace with the president as i said before he was pardoned patsy thomasson who is one of president clintons righthand persons at the white house and has been for a long long time the head of the demo crat party in arkansas during his administration she was tied to lassiter before during and after the tinie he was convicted of drug dealing she was running his company when all of these bond transactions 107 million took place and nobody knows from when the money came but they know the money was transferred through dennis patricks account he did not know anything about it so it must have been an illegal transaction that should be investigated by the irs and the fbi the money went to mr lassiter and his account in these two banks i alluded to earlier in order for us to vindicate the president get all of this cleared up in order for us to vindicate and clear up patsy thomassons relations with mr lasater in order for us to protect dennis patrick and i might add that dennis patricks life has been not only threatened they tried to kill him three times since all of this took place the man has been in hiding with his family because he is afraid he is going to be killed he was in to see us today in order to protect him we need to have congressional hearings it is absolutely imperative this goes beyond whitewater it goes into drug trafficking it goes into money laundering it goes into all kinds of things in order for this president to be able to do his job effectively we think this all needs to be cleared up the only way it is going to be cleared up is through a dongressional investigation let m say one more thing and then i will yield to my colleague the gentleman from california that is this some people will say this is political i think it goes way beyond politics but we must look back to the reagan and bush administration when things that were of much less consequence than this much less consequence than this to the american people were investigated by congressional hearings there were 23 congressional hearings during the bush and reagan administrations and every time we asked for anything any information relating to whitewater or anything else we were stonewalled by the administration and the entire executive branch it was that way in the ron brown affair and it is that way in whitewater and we believe it is going to be that way in this drug investigation we are talking about right now and the possible money laundering i say to my colleagues and to anybody else who is paying attention this is a very serious matter it deserves congressional oversight it deserves congressional investigation it is our responsibility as a congress to look into this i would say to my colleagues let u get on with it if it was a republica administration we would have don this months ago it is a democrat ad ministration and let us do the righ thing and clear this thing up with that i yield to in colleague the gentleman from califoi nia"], [0.0029060756787657738, 0.0029060756787657738, 0, "i thank my dear friend from indianapolis for yielding me this time i rise to join with my colleagues from louisiana and florida who very eloquently have been discussing over the past several weeks the fact that one of the greatest attacks on the process of representative government has taken place since the january 5 back in the 95th congress when we looked at legislation that was moving to the floor of the house fully 85 percent of the rules which came to the floor bringing legislation for us to consider were open allowing for free and fair debate and 15 percent of the rules were restricted e 1730 by restrictive rules i mean of course members who represent today 600 000 americans who were prevented from being able to stand up on the floor when they were considering legislation and offer amendments we have seen since that time when only 15 percent of the rules being restrictive we look most recently at the 102d congress when 66 percent of the rules were restrictive preventing members from having the opportunity to represent their constituents and stand up on the floor of the house and offer amendments now as we have moved into this 103d congress since january 5 we have had 10 major pieces of legislation which have been considered here on the house floor ranging from the motorvoter legislation family planning family and medical leave extend unemployment benefits a wide range of measures every single one of them have been gag rules preventing members from having the right to stand up and represent their constituents i think the important point that needs to be made here is not that members right are being violated but the rights of the american people are being violated there are literally millions and millions of americans who are disenfranchised by virtue of the fact that their representatives cannot stand here in the well of the house and offer an amendment that is really what has happened the american people are being told very arrogantly by the majority leadership in this institution that representative government does not work that we know better for you than the person who you elected to represent you unfortunately that has existed throughout the entire 103d congress as we are here in midapril now one of the things that we have done we are so frustrated and it is not just republicans it is not just minority members but democrats too have been prevented from having the right to offer amendments so one of the things that we have done on our side we have established the republican leadership task force on deliberative democracy specifically geared toward looking at this problem i happen to believe as i have said that this is probably the greatest attack on the process of representative government that we have seen in literally decades i cannot imagine what would be a greater attack on the process of democratic government than preventing elected representatives from having the right to amend legislation there are a wide range of things that have been used to prevent us from working our will on legislation in behalf of our constituents for example there is something known as the 3day layover provision on legislation it is a very simple and basic thing that came into place came into effect in 1970 what it says is that there should be 3 days for a committee report to be available for members before they have to vote on legislation so what do we do we consistently waive that 3day layover measure in fact on 77 percent of the rules that have been considered in the 103d congress the 3day layover period provision has been totally thrown out the window let us look again at the history of this in 1972 the average length of measures that were considered here on the house floor were 3 2 pages and constantly people were allowed to have 3 days to read work with their staffs and look at measures before they voted on them today the average length of measures that we consider here is 12 8 pages so if you look at the very small number of pages that existed in the early 1970s and 3 days to consider it and today the longer bills that we have to look at and the fact that we have in many cases virtually no time to even read these measures at all it is again a very serious attack on the process of representative government now as i look at the constant waivers that we have on the 3day layover provision one must ask would an individual embark on a major contract for the purchase of a home or an automobile or any small business person without having had the opportunity to look at it whether that person is expert on it or a staff member or an assistant no of course not and yet the representatives in this house are consistently being told that they have to vote on measures without having the opportunity to look at those at all over the past few weeks we have had very rigorous debates on the budget one of the other things that we do consistently is that we waive the budget act this debate that we went through on consideration of the budget is something that was taken very seriously on the house floor and yet when we upstairs in the rules committee consider this what happens is that we throw it out the window meaning that there is very little meaning to what it is that we are actually doing when we are trying to pass and put into place a budget then of course the attack on the amendment process itself democrats and republicans sit in line up in the rules committee my friend the gentleman from sanibel fl mr goes and myself sit there and listen to expert witnesses who have very valid ideas like the gentleman from louisiana like the gentleman from indiana they come before our committee and they request the opportunity to consider their amendments on the floor of the house and what happens consistently on partyline votes we see the leadership sit there and vote no denying the rights of members to even consider these ideas on the floor of the house in full view of the american public so i think that the goal of our task force on deliberative democracy is to let the american people know that one of the greatest attacks on representative government has taken place in the first 3 2 months of 1993 the gentleman from florida and i and the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from tennessee will work diligently to try to ensure that the rights of not only our minority members but the rights of democrats are recognized so that they can in fact offer amendments on the house floor and that the arrogance of the democrat leadership will not continue to stifle the will of the majority membership of this house members on both sides of the aisle who want to have the rights of their constituents recognized so i thank my friend the gentleman from indiana for giving me the opportunity to share in his time and i congratulate those who want to struggle in behalf of greater democracy of greater opportunity for the rights of their constituents to be heard here on the floor of the house"], [0.002909549977630377,

on rules frankly this has moved a little further away from the kinds of restrictions we have had in the past but tragically it includes many of the restrictions we have been dealing with and because of one of them i would like to speak about for a moment ithas gotten worse that restriction has to do with a very important process the 3day layover why is it that we have the 3day layover very simply i do not think you would enter into a business agreement or purchase a home or engage in any kind of major activity without having read it first the idea behind the 3day layover is very simple it is there so that we may in fact allow members to have the opportunity to review legislation before they exercise their constitutional right and vote for it or against it as we look at this problem of the 3day layover we have once again waived the rule here we are on march 10 1993 the 3d month of the loedcongress and what has happened well five of the past six pieces of legislation that we have had rules on that have been considered here on the house floor have waived the 3day layover back in 1983 and 1984 5 percent of the rules that came down waived the 3day layover but so far in the 103d congress 83 percent of the rules considered here have waived the 3day layover on 83 percent of the major legislation we are considering we do not allow members to read it based on the rules of this house now let us look at the last 20 years the perpage average of statutes that have come forward in 1972 was 3 8 pages in 1992 it was 12 8 pages so we have seen an increase in the size of legislation but we have had a decrease in the ability for members to at least look at legislation it seems to me that we once again are continuing this 100percent record of restrictive rules limiting the ability of members to exercise their right to represent the 600 000 constituents who sent them here and i think we have an opportunity to rectify it here we are going very simply to vote no on the previous question we want to bring an end to this 3month pattern of tyranny here that has been going on and allow the gentleman from new york to offer this amendment which will in fact bar the flow of aids immigrants into this country and when we do that we will finally be moving in the direction of fair and balanced rules i again thank my friend the gentleman from sanibel mr goss for yielding me the

provisions of h r 3355 but the process by which this crime bill has been developed was marked every step of the way with partisan roadblocks attempts to improve this bill have been rejected by the democratcontrolled rules committee from consideration on the house floor and in conference these roadblocks have obstructed efforts to produce many tough meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system the bill was filed at 7 last night which means the rules committee had 1 hour to review the document before voting on its rule for republicans there has not been a complete conference document to refer to in order to know about specific provisions the responsible vote is to oppose the rule and send the measure back so improvements can be made improvements which will correct some of the missed opportunities and respond to the needs of lawabiding citizens police forces prosecutors courts and prison systems around my home state and the rest of the nation the legislation i have supported throughout this process h r 2872 includes measures among other things to set mandatory minimum prison terms for violent crimes provide funding for additional police officers limit probation and parole limit death row appeals and expand the death penalty provide funding to fight illegal immigration and strengthen criminal alien deportation laws increase penalties for crimes committed with guns provide funding for prison space to incarcerate violent offenders and provide a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule some of the provisions of our bill were included in the conference repqrt but other im portant provisions designed to fight violent crime including a measure to allow evidence of prior sex crimes of the accused to be admitted in sex child molestation cases were not included despite instructions to house to do so i will continue to fight for their passage according to the uniform crime report the violent crime rate in arizona increased 129 percent between the years of 1975 and 1993 to make the changes necessary to ensure the safety of our citizens this crime bill should be improved defeating the rule will allow for that if we know that we could reduce the problem of violent crime by 70 percent with just a few actions would we do it according to researchers at the university of pennsylvania approximately 7 pescent of criminals commit over 70 percent of violent crime if we facilitate putting and keeping these criminals in prison we eliminate the chance of being victimized by their actions the conference report therefore should be changed to more adequately provide prison construction funding for the states the conference report includes only 6 5 billion in state funding for prisons of that amount up to approximately 4 billion can be used by states for nonprison construction activities the house is already on record instructing conferees to include 13 5 billion in prison construction and according to government data supplied by michael block of the university of arizona between 1980 and 1990 and 10 states with the highest increase in their prison populations relative to total fbi crime indexes experienced on average a decline in their crime rates of more than 20 percent while the states with the smallest increases in incarceration rates averaged almost a 9 percent increase in crime rates clearly we can take a big step to better help states keep violent criminals off our nations streets and in jail by providing more prison funding the crime bill should also be changed to encourage states to ensure that violent repeat offenders are locked up under threestrikesyoureout and truthinsentencing laws the conference report requires that under its threestrikesyoureout provision the third strike be a federal violent offense which will result in only about 300 to 400 violent repeat offenders being taken off our nations streets for good according to mr block every day this year 14 people will be murdered 48 women raped and 568 people robbed by criminals who have already been caught convicted and then returned to the streets on probation or early release the crime bill should be changed to increase the number of repeat offenders who will be put behind bars for good another area in need of complete redirection in the crime bill is the 9 billion allocated for social programs given that among other things the crime bill a only allocates a part of what is needed for prisons b will only fund about a fifth of the 100 000 local police officers promised and c has been criticized by the director of the federal bureau of ihvestigation for taking needed agent resources from the fbi and drug enforcement administration the responsible action to take is to send the crime bill back to conference to prioritize the spending in this bill for example the youth employment and skills crime prevention program in the bill includes over 900 million for a jobs program for youth the problem is that according to the general accounting office the federal government already spends 25 billion on 154 federal job training programs many of them specifically designed for disadvantaged youth many believe this is illustrative of duplicative wasteful programs which are funded in this crime bill and should be eliminated another provision of the bill which should be sent back to conferenceis the semiautomatic weapons ban which passed the house by a vote of 216 to 214 earlier in the year and which 1 voted against the biggest difference we can make to reduce crimes committed with guns is not to infringe on lawabiding peoples rights but to significantly increase penalties for illegal use of guns several attempts were made to increase penalties in this bill for crimes committed with guns and even though the house has voted to instruct conferees to increase these penalties ultimately they were rejected by the democratcontrolled conference committee that shouldbe corrected there are other important issues such as the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule which allows evidence obtained by police in good faith to be admissible in court even if its seizure was beyond the technical scope of the fourth amendment several attempts were made to include this measure in the bill but again the democratcontrolled house rejected those attempts the direction on this bill should be clear the congress should take this opportunity to be responsible vote down the rule and send this bill back to the drawing board where the questionable provisions can be takenout strengthening amendments can be added and the rights and safety of lawabiding citizens can be protected we have the opportunity do the right thing vote against the rule on this bill"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9935995638370514,

their old age and lifted them from the degradations of poverty in their senior years my mother receives social security my grandmother receives social security they both need and depend on their social security checks tens of thousands of my constituents receive and need and depend on social security no one is a stronger supporter of social security than i am i want to preserve and protect the integrity and the inviolability ofsocial security i want to keep the social security trust fund separate and safe im cosponsoring a bill to help the notch babies who have been treated unfairly in the payment of social security benefits i do my very best every day to help each and every one of my constituents who has any difficulty in obtaining the social security benefits to which they are entitled by law i am and i will always remain an ardent advocate for social security it is for this reason that i am outraged by the distortions and the outright lies of many of those who oppose the social security provisions in president clintons economic plan in a partisan effort to oppose the president many who know better are causing fear among many senior citizens who have nothing at all to fear and much to gain from the presidents plan it is long past time to look beyond the rhetoric of the fearmongers and examine the facts the fact is if you dont pay taxes on your social security benefits now you will not pay taxes on your benefits once the presidents plan is enacted at present 80 percent of social security beneficiaries do not pay income taxes on their benefits they wont under the presidents plan for example seniors earning less than 25 000 currently pay no taxes on their social security benefits under the presidents proposal they still will not pay taxes on those benefits the fact is the additional tax on social security benefits proposed by the senateand since endorsed by me with my vote and by the overwhelming majority of the houseapplies to only 13 percent of social security recipients these 13 percent are the most affluent by far with an average net worth of at least 1 million taxing them is fair clearly these are not impoverished seniors surviving on meager fixed incomes the fact is the presidents plan would not hurt the needy it would not touch colas on social security on which needy seniors depend i would oppose any plan that would cut colas for needy seniors because that would plunge half a million americans into poverty overnight i would oppose any effort to try to balance the budget on the b cks of needy seniors the presidents plan would not do that the factis this is not a confiscation of social security benefits but merely an inclusion of more of the benefits of the most affluent recipients for purposes of calculating their taxes at the customary rates if you are paying taxes on your benefits now then under the presidents proposal 85 percent of your social security benefits will be included in calculating your taxes at the appropriate rate instead of the current 50 percent if you are not paying taxes on your social security benefits now you will be completely unaffected by the presidents proposal the fact is this is not double taxation the average wage earner gets back in social security benefits every penny he puts in social security payroll taxes during this entire working life plus interest in less than 5 years everything received beyond that is simply a transfer payment from current workers to retireesover and above what the retirees paid in and would have otherwise accrued in interest eightyfive percent of the benefits that the average recipient receives over his lifetime are over and above what that recipient paid into the system while working plus interestwhich is precisely why that specific percentage of benefits was chosen for inclusion in taxation the fact is the presidents proposal may actually provide tax relief for some seniors on social security the senate proposal to which the house of representatives recently agreedand which i favorcreates new and higher income thresholds of 32 000 for single taxpayers and s40 000 for married couples before any social security benefits are taxed an increase to 85 percent of the amount of social security benefits subject to tax would apply only to income above these new and higher thresholds this means that fewer people will be paying taxes on their social security under the presidents proposal than are paying taxes on such benefits now these are the facts and i am confident that the vast majority of my constituents and the vast majority of the american people are smart enough to respond to the facts and not to the fears inspired by those with purely partisan motives once this plan is enacted come next april when they pay their taxes seniors will know they have been misleadbut not by me and not by the president the fact is most federal spending is for social security and other mandatory and entitlement programs many of those programs benefit seniors all of them must be maintained yet it is undeniably true that all americans including those seniors who can afford it must share fairly in some needed sacrifice to restrain federal spending reduce our federal budget deficit and restore our economic health as a nation otherwise over the long term we wont be able to afford social security"], [0.991461206227541,

resolutions regarding unitedstates military involvement in haiti as many of my colleagues know i opposed the invasion of haiti and cosponsored legislation to require the president to seek the approval ofcongress prior to any military intervention in haiti however the president committed unitedstates troops prior to congressional consideration and now we have 20 000 troops in that country today we debate how best to move forward given the fact that our men and women in uniform are in haiti facing daily danger but as yet thankfully without loss of life there are three resolutions on the floor today one sponsored by rep michel urging an immediate withdrawal of troops one by rep murtha expressing the withdrawal of unitedstates troops as soon as possible and one by rep toricelli authorizing the placement of troops in haiti and urging their withdrawal by march 1 1995 while i opposed an invasion of haiti i do not believe with 20 000 troops in that country we should pull them out today such a resolution sends a mixed signal to the military leaders in haiti undercuts the soldiers and sailors who are working for a quick and peaceful resolution to the return of exiled president aristide and potentially even puts them in harms way therefore i intend to vote against the michel resolution the toricelli resolution authorizes this mission retroactively and urges a withdrawal by march 1 of unitedstates troops stationed in haiti as an opponent of military intervention of haiti i do not believe that we should authorize this mission for that reason i will oppose the toricelli resolution i intend to vote for the murtha resolution which calls for withdrawal of unitedstates troops as soon as possible from haiti it is similar to the bipartisan resolution sponsored by senators bob dole and george mitchell now under consideration in the senate the president has indicated the return of president aristide by october 15 1994 just a few days away once he has returned to haiti we should bring our troops home as the situation becomes more secure and allow the uniti rise today to express my support for the michel substitute to h j res 416 the michel substitute is the best course of action in haiti from the beginning i have opposed united states military involvement in haiti we need to do everything we can to get our troops home and out of harms way i believe that the michel alternative establishes a clear plan to bring our soldiers home the michel substitute is also the only alternative that prohibits unitedstates forces from serving under foreign command along with the fear of losing american lives there are several reasons that stand out in my mind why we shouldnt be in haiti for example who is going to assume the cost of this mission i know the united nation approved this occupation but i dont see our allies opening up their checkbooks for support i will tell you who is going to pay the american taxpayer the department of defense has already stated it does not have enough money to cover the 250 million initial cost of this operation estimates of the cost of the occupation are now being made as high as 3 billion so once again the american taxpayer is going to get stuck with the bill for an occupation that the majority of americans oppose something is wrong with the picture another concern is the fact that president clinton blatantly ignoredthe will of the american people and the congress instead he turned to the united nations rather than the elected officials of his own country giving the people the impression that mr clinton places the approval of the united nation ahead of the american people it is also sad that only after american troops have been in haiti for 2 weeks that we now are addressing this issue properly on thefloor of the house of representatives it is unfortunate that the democratic leadership prohibited the congress from voting on this important matter prior to the united states occupation of haiti president clinton should study the rules of engagement outlined by former secretary of defense caspar weinberger secretary weinberger argued that there are four principles that should be adhered to before committing unitedstates troops on foreign soil the operation should have the support of the american people and the congress the mission should be specifically defined the operation should be in the strategic interest of the united states and finally there should be a dear exit plan for our troops unfortunately the haiti occupation does not satisfy any of these four criteria you may recall that this is not the first nationbuilding exercise for american troops in haiti from 1915 to 1934 unitedstates forces occupied this caribbean nation to no avail in fact haiti has never had a sustainable democracy mr

onehalf million shipments per day of hazardous materlals materials necessary for our industries and from which we all benefit our two committees stringent oversight of the program has helped to achieve that safety record and i am sum that our actions today will serve to continue our enviable record h r 2178 as amended reauthorizes the hazardous materials transportation act for 4 years makes some technical clarifications imposes a reciprocal registration fee waiver to foreign shippers and provides for certain training and studies for hazardous material related issues i urge my colleagues to support h r i also want to note that a provision to clarify a section of the highway beautification act was dropped out of h r 3460 the bill reported by the public works and transportation committee due to a jurisdictional conflict with the energy and commerce committee i have a commitment that this issue will be dealt with at the first appropriate opportunity the provision in question is section 13 of h r 3460 as reported by the public works and transportation committee this provision made a technical correction to section 131 s of the highway beautification act as added by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 that prohibits new billboards on scenic byways the purpose of the istea provision was to protect truly scenic areas all discussion of that provision related to scenic values and the understanding of the members during consideration of that provision was that it related solely to roads in scenic areas the federal highway administration interpreted that provision to override other provisions of the highway beautification act that permit the erection of billboards in commercial and industrial areas under the fhwa interpretation the new istea provision applies to commercial and industrial areas that may be designated as part of a scenic byway for the purposes of connecting scenic areas a state that has a scenic byway program will in most cases want to designate continuous scenic byway routes that is a scenic route that traverses mostly rural areas may pass through towns and cities the advantages of continuous scenic byways are numerous particularly conceming mapping and nolice to motorists what the fhwa interpretation means is that if a state designates a segment of road that runs through a commercial and industrial area as part of a scenic byway for the purpose of connectivity that segment of road would be subject to the new billboard prohibition no matter how urban or blighted that commercial or industrial area might be and even if the state does not want to change its billboard regulation in commercial and industrial areas the public works and transportation committee believes that the fhwa interpretation of section 131 s is not the best reading of the section the last sentence of section 131 s reads as follows control of any sign display or device on such a highway shall be in accordance with this section this section includes subsection d the commercial and industrial exemption the congress intended by this sentence that the scenic byway provisions would be subject to all the other provisions of the highway beautification act in addition if congress had intended to override other longstanding provisions of the act it would have explicitly done so a basic feature of the beautification act is to permit states to allow billboards to remain in industrial and commercial areas congress would not have relied on inference to make such a drastic change in the law indeed the conferees on istea never discussed the possibility of overtuming the commercial and industrial exemption the anomaly of the fhwa interpretation is that it preempts states in an area where they have never been preempted under the highway beautification act under the act a state may ban new billboards anywhere n the state including commercial and industrial zones the state may also choose to continue the federal commercial and industrial exemption the fhwa interpretation tells the state that if it designates a continuous scenic byway it may not as a matter of federal lawcontinue the commercial and industrial exemption even in the most blighted areas"]], "top_unsure": [[6.347894668579102e-05, 0.4999365210533142, 0, "if that is has not come about thiscistapparentlyha generallinstructhe gentlemans intent it

the title x family planning program and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting for this bill it is unfortunate the politics of abortion in general and the gag rule in particular have prevented congress from enacting a title x authorization bill for nearly a decade counseling and referrals for pregnancy management options are only a few of the numerous services provided by title x clinics more importantly the program also underwrites basic and reproductive health services for more than 4 million women with priority given to lowincome adults and teens in the fourth congressional district of wisconsin which i represent the title x program finances these important services for more than 13 000 women moreover tite x birth control services prevent at least 1 2 million unintended pregnancies nationwide each year thereby precluding an estimated 516 000 abortions in addition it should be noted that for every 1 invested in family planning services the federal government saves 4 40 in mandatory social services by voting today to authorize title x funds for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 we would save money in the long term while ensuring that women in my district and yours continue receiving vital health services over the next 2 years turning to the gag rule issue it is reasonable and wise to restore in law the title x programs counseling and referral policy on pregnancy management options this policy was replaced in 1992 by the gag rule that bars clinic professionals from discussing abortion with a patient under nearly all circumstances before the gag rule took effect clinic personnel were required to offer comprehensive and nondirectlve counseling on the legal options available to a woman faced with an unplanned pregnancy included information on prenatal care and delivery child care foster care and adoption and abortion referrals to providers of the service chosen by the woman were also offered by clinic personnel the gag rule clearly eliminated a sensible policy that from 1970 to 1992 limited the demand for abortions while enabling women to receive the information needed to make fully informed decisions about their care accordingly i am pleased that h r 670 would place into law the nondirective counseling and referral policy once used by title x clinics in addition this bill allows individual title x projects or personnel that are morally opposed to abortion to refuse to supply counseling or referrals for it as long as they direct the patient toward another provider that is willing and qualified to provide such counseling and referrals finally h r 670 deserves our support because it does not weaken current federal law that bars title x clinics from using taxpayer funds to perform abortions i oppose government financing of abortion except in cases of rape incest or if by continuing a pregnancy a womans life would be endangered or her health impaired it is time to set aside politics as usual and authorize funding for the beneficial title x program let me emphasize again that the programs goal is the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and abortions there has always been a prohibition on the use of funds for abortions thousands of unintended pregnancies and abortions have been prevented each year thanks to title x millions of dollars have been saved in other medical and social services accordingly i urge my colleagues to vote for passage of h r 670"], [0.00016951560974121094, 0.4998304843902588, 1, "i rise in support of the fawell amendment this amendment strikes over 87 million in spending from the bill for 100 special research grants and buildings and facilities of the cooperative state research service these projects are not specifically authorized by law and in all but a few cases were not requested by the president our porkbusters legislation has for the last 3 years sought to rescind previously appropriated funding for these projects mr chairman and colleagues many of

competitive grants program when the bill is in conference the president himself included these earmarks in his spending reduction recommendations and suggested that they could be funded by agribusiness or others and of the 71 special grants only 9 were requested by the administration and the administration requested nozerofunding for the building and facilities account if these projects
