modification has to do with the income eligibility limitations under the program rather than basing the limit on the area family median income the revised version of the bill would utilize the statewide family median income a statistic which is already kept by the department of housing and urban development i believe the use of the statewide figure would be more equitable lnd would eliminate the possibility that families with identical incomes in neighboring communities in the same state would or would not qualify for the program based upon the statistical area in which they happened to reside this concept continues to recognize however that incomes around the country vary from state to state and takes that into account in determining the proper income limitations as in the prior bill eligibility would be for those at or below 130 percent of the family median income but as i have said the statewide not area median would be employed there are no other changes to the legislation high interest rates are making it virtually impossible for firsttime homebuyers even those with very reason able incomes who have saved diligently to afford a home besides the dev astation caused to these families by their inability to participate in the american dream of homeownership construction and building trades persons homebuilders realtors building suppliers and those in financial institutions have suffered greatly as millions of the postwar babyboom generation have reached adulthood the problem has only gotten worse and the administration unable or unwilling to propose concrete solutions has done nothing unacceptably high interest rates show no sign of significantly decreasing any time soon the firsttime homeowners opportunity act would provide mortgage assistance in fiscal year 1983 to more than 100 000 firsttime home purchasers whose family incomes are no more than 130 percent of statewide median this assistance would be utilized to reduce the cost of an phainsured mortgageby direct payments by the federal government to the mortgage holderto as low as 9v percent but would be limited to no more than the amount necessary to reduce monthly payments for the mortgage insurance and real estate taxes to 30 percent of the homeowners income the limitations requiring the homeowner to expend 30 percent of income on housing costs means that the mortgage will not necessarily be subsidized to as low as 9 percent thus saving federal expenditures and allowing us to serve a greater number of firsttime buyers payments would continue for 10 yearsunless the homeowner sold the homebut could be continued after 10 years if the secretary of hud determined that the family was still financially unable to assume the full cost of the mortgage assistance would be recaptured upon sale of the home but would be limited to 50 percent of the net appreciation of the value of the property purchasers of new and existing singlefamily homes and individual condominium and cooperative unitswhich do not result in the displacement of a tenantcould utilize the program the maximum sales price would be 110 percent of the maximum pha mortgage which will mean a price limit of 74 000 in most parts of the country the minimum downpayment would be 5 percent of the purchase price to illustrate the dramatic effect this program can have on the lives of firsttime homeowners take the following example to purchase a 60 000 hme a modestly priced dwelling by todays standards and to carry a 57 000 mortgage at 15v percentthe current fha interest rate limitfor 30 years cost 767 including mortgage insurance adding real estate taxes and hazard insurance means the monthly housing cost is likely to be over 900 a family earning 35 000 applying 30 percent of its income to housing could not afford such a mortgage without the assistance this program would provide on the other hand with the help the firsttime homeowners opportunity act would offer a family with an income of approximately 25 000 applying 30 percent of its income could afford the same mortgage and home and could therefore have a chance to participate in the american dream the 400 million appropriation authorized in this legislation would help alleviate the most serious and widespread crisis we have witnessed in the housing industry since the great depression it would provide new hope for americans

collector brought a very interesting packet of information to my attention it contained a colorful brochure an order blank and several other pieces of literature all aimed at promoting a unique numismatic adventuregreek olympia coins these coins are being marketed by numinvest corp a subsidiary of the parisbased international bankers lazard freres an organization that wanted to market unitedstates olympie commemorative coins as you know the house of representatives recently approved my olympic coin proposal by a vote of 302 to 84 this plan calls for the minting of two silver dollars and one gold 10dollar coin to be sold directly to the public by the mint the house vote signaled an overwhelming rejection of a rival proposal that called for the minting of 17 coins to be sold to the public through private marketers i vehemently objected to the private marketing plan because it had all the ingredients of a firstclass ripoff too many coins issued with nontraditional face values a prohibitively high price tag and an enormous potential for private profiteering at the expense of our olympic athletes if numinvests greek venture is any indication of how they would have approached the marketing of our olympic commemorative coins my suspicions were wellfounded when i opened the greek olympia coins brochure i was immediately struck by the slick packaging there is absolutely no way to deny itthis is an impressive brochure the photographs are clear the layout bold and the text of the copy persuasive it is filled with reference to the history of the modern olympics and their greek heritage indeed the designs for the coins shown in this brochure were based on ancient works of art after perusing the leaflet a bit longer i decided to look more closely at the information on the coins themselves and this is where the story really gets interesting this pamphlet merely describes the first series of coinsthere are two more to come these coins can only be purchased in sets of either three silver or two gold coins so if you want to buy just one coin you are out of luck although the brochure contains quotes like these coins have already cpatured the interest and admiration of experts around the world due to their historical significance beauty attention to detail and affordable price in light of their generous precious metal content these coins are hardly what you would call a good value a set of silver coins in uncirculated condition costs 64 50 the same coins in proof condition are 93 based on current exchange rates and silver prices these coins have a total face value of 13 14 and contaih bullion worth 8 31 that is an incredible markup ranging from 390 percent to 608 percent over the intrinsic value of the coins the gold coins are priced in a similar fashion they are available only in proof condition with a set of two going for 527 70 these coins have a face value of 116 and contain bullion worth 176 at todays gold prices the consumer is paying three times the intrinsic value of the coins a complete set of three silver and two gold series i coins in proof condition has a price tag of 620 70 for this sum the consumer receives 184 worth of precious metal and coins with a face value of 129 one should keep in mind that these figures represent the cost of owning only one series of coins in proof condition the actual cost of participating in the program could be considerably higher since there are three threecoin series each of proof and uncirculated silver coins and three twocoin sets of proof gold coins indeed owning a complete set of the coins would cost 2 056 the 24 coins in the complete set would have a combined face value of only 427 and contain bullion worth 577 these figures certainly refute the brochures claim that this is truly an affordable collection contrary to the marketers claim that the greek olympia coin collection is sure to be sought after by collectors as the first authentic coin issue of its kind these coins are not likely to appreqlate in value the greek olympia coins are what experts call pseudocoins that means that the coins although they officially have legal tender status are really more like medallions since their face values and technical specifications are artificial and arbitrary as a result they are not attractive to coin collectors numismatists tell me that the coins are not likely to be worth any more than their bullion value thus the consumer is paying over 2 000 for bullion worth only 577 one piece of literature states thatthree percent of the face value realized from the sale of the coins in the united states and canada will go to their respective olympic teams and athletic federations therefore as a subscriber to this collection you become in a real sense a participant in one of mans oldest and noblest traditions if someone purchased these coins in order to support our amateur athletes he or she would be sorely disappointed spending either 64 50 or 93 for one series of the silver coins would yield the unitedstates olympic committee exactly 39 cents our amateur athletes would receive 3 47 from the 527 70 one spent on a set of gold coins if one paid 2 056 for the entire series of coins the net to our athletes would be 12 75 this is hardly a cost efficient means of supporting amateur athletics i soon realized that the slick packaging was a vain attempt at disguising the shortcomings of the product itself you may in fact be wondering exactly what it is that greek olympia coins are commemorating i wondered the same thing as i was leafing through the brochure the marketers go to extreme lengths discussing the greek olympic traditionundoubtedly in the hope that you will think that these are greek olympic coins they are not these coins are being struck to commemorate the 1982 paneuropean games to be held in athens nevertheless you would have an extremely difficult time figuring this out from the sales material one piece of literature mentioned the word olympic or its derivatives 23 times there was only one reference td the paneuropean games apparently this ploy can be very effective the person who sent me this material attached a note that began enclosed find letter i received on greek olympic coins as you can see this is a clear case of misleading advertising the coins are grossly overpriced worthless to collectors useless as a means of raising money for amateur athletes and have absolutely nothing to do with the olympics given the history of privately marketed commemorative coins i should not have been surprised by this latest commemorative coin scheme throughout the entire olympic coin controversy i warned this congress about the inadvisability of allowing the consortium formed by lazard freres and occidental petroleum to market our olympic coins the greek olympia program is a clear example of that the house vote signaled a clear mandate to keep these people out of our program however although the house has endorsed a governmentrun program the full congress and the administration have not yet concurred if they retreat from the house position and favor the private marketers we may very well end up with a greek olympiatype program if that happens these marketers will make huge profits at the expense of both the american consumer and our amateur athletes"],

memory to recall his vision for america and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure

enormous tax cut that the administration advocated and that has contributed to the deficit that we face today my amendment failed in fact i got only four votes later the house adopted the administrations budgetthe grammlatta substitute the administrations budget was based on the radical supplyside theory that you do not have to balance the budget it was based on the theory that an enormous gap between what you spend and what you take in in revenue will somehow send a positive signal to wall street during the budget committeep markup last year my good friend the gentleman from new york who is the architect of the administrations tax cut made a statement that i found shocking and almost incredible at the time however events have proved the accuracy of mr kemps remarks on

sound course to take i voted to report the budget committees recommendation because i believed we needed a vehicle to bring this debate to the floor and that was the fairest and soundest proposal i had seen until that point but we are now in the middle of a debate in which achieving a deficit of 110 billion is considered a great victory for fiscal responsibility last friday the republican senate

deficit is hailed as a great victory we all know the answer to this question the answerin one wordis reaganomics reaganomics has produced a 1983 projected deficit of 182 billion compared to a reaganomics deficit of 182 billion 116 billion looks good but only in comparison to the outrageous result imposed upon us by reaganomics last year the administration told us we needed a massive military buildup they said we needed to spend 1 5 trillion on the military over 5 years along with this massive increase in military spending they said we needed an enormous tax cut to be more specific they said that the wealthy and big corporations needed a big tax cut the message was the ntion needs this big military buildup but we do not have to pay for it in fact we need to make major cuts in our revenues this illogical combination of spending increases and tax cuts was somehow supposed to instill confidence in the financial markets this has not happened what has happened was what was predictable all along the financial markets saw that reaganomics produces increasing deficits and so they kept interest rates high and stifled recovery in addition to a 182 billion deficit

athletic competition among the greatest amateur athletes in the wvorld the games are designed to benefit the athletes unfortunately the 1984 summer olympic games in los angeles may well be the games where the concerns of private outside interests are more important than the athletes unless congress acts to protect the interests of the athletes the unitedstates government and the american people a new event world scandal may be added to the 1984 summer olympic games at the present time there are two coinage proposals before the congress designed to raise money to help finance the massive costs of the 1984 games and to help train american athletes for those games these proposals are signficantly different and it is important that the differences be known i am a strong supporter of the olympic program and our olympic athletes i was the author of legislation last year to provide gold medals to our entire olympic team and i was proud to stand on the steps of the capitol when the members of our team were awarded these medals by the president of the united states while these gold medals in no way made up for the disappointment of our athletes not participating in moscow they nevertheless were designed to recogn17e these men and women for their athletic excellence because of my feeling toward our olympic athletes i introduced legislation on june 11 of this year designed to raise money to train athletes the legislation h r 3879 provides for the minting of 90 percent silver dollar coins that would be sold directly to the public by the unitedstates mint half the proceeds of the sale would be used to reduce the national debt and the other half would go to the united states olympic committee to train our olympic athletes the legislation calls for the minting of 25 million silver dollars the coins would be sold at a price in the 20 to 25 range at that price my legislation wbuld raise between 100 to 275 million if all the coins were sold given the success of the recent carson city silver dollar sale i fully anticipate a sellout of the olympic coins my legislation provides for a general accounting office audit of both the sale of the coins and the use of the proceeds by the united states olympie committee to make certain that the money goes directly to the benefit of athletic training the week after introduction of my bill a second bill which i call the lazardoccidental bill was introduced this legislation calls for the striking of 29 different coins by the unitedstates mint with all of the coins being sold directly to a marketing group composed of the investment banking firm of lazard freres and occidental petroleum who have been given a license by the los angeles olympic committee to sell olympic coins the bulk of the proceeds from the sale of these coins would go to the private marketers in fact the private interests can earn as much as 94 million profit on this deal a portion of the funds raised by the 29 coin bill would be given to the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and an even smaller amount would be funneled to the united states olympic committee the legislation does not allow for the general accounting office to audit any portion of the transaction and in fact it virtually turns control of the unitedstates mint over to lazard freres and occidental i am deeply concerned that the lazardoccidental bill will lead to scandal not only will our athletes be tainted and the american people disillusioned but the bill actually may provide little or no money for training our athletes in february 4 months prior to the introduction of any legislation the laooc quietly awarded exclusive worldwide marketing rights for olympic coins to a concern composed of lazard freres and occidental lazardocaidental gave the laqoc 5 million of which 1 million is nonrefundable the laqoc is also entitled to keep all th interest earned on the other 4 million in march the laooc gave the unitedstates olympic committee a check for 500 000 as their share of the nonrefundable 1 million in effect the laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee sold their rights in any coins to lazard freres and occidental petroleum this is morally and ethiically wrong and casts doubt on the ability of the lagoc and the olympic committee to speak objectively on this issue secrecy seems to surround the details of the relationship between the laooc and lazardoccidental for the past 3 months i have tried without success to obtain a copy of the contract between the laooc and lazard freresoccidental i have received a copy of theletter of understanding between the parties but despite assurances from those representing the coin marketers that i would get a copy of the contract it has never been presented i can well understand why they would not make the contract available to me because the letter of understanding is so shocking that the complete contract is probably too hot to be made public lazardoccidental are no strangers to the world of marketing olympic and sportsrelated coins last year they had the exclusive rights to marketing soviet olympic coins in the free world it is ironic that they were pushing these coins in the american market at the very same time our athletes had made a decision not to participate in the moscow games while i stood on the capitol steps as our olympic athletes received medals for boycotting the moscow games lazardoccidental were busy raising american money to stage those games as with the agreement with laooc information about the financial aspects of the sale of soviet coins is hard to come by as far as i know no information has been released although various members of the media have requested it from both the russians and the lazardoccidental marketing concern recently i learned that a company called numarco distributing co has been accused of improprieties in greece in obtaining the exclusive mar my bill requires that the money be keting rights for coins commemorating used

street and a republican i might adddr wassily leontieff the nobel prizewinning economist and authority on economic structures at new york university and dr lester thurow of mit in the last few months have all voiced the strongest doubts about the economic viability and desirability of the reagan administrations defense program i notice yesterday as reported in the washington post today the mormon church and its leaders ii a very rare comment on national policies came out in opposition to the mx missile system their statement of opposition it should be noticed by my colleagues went far beyond the mx missile the mormon church leadership squarely attacked the basic assumptions behind the unitedstates military establishment the soviet military establishment and the frightening global arms race that both superpowers equally are contributing toward referring to the terrifying arms race that~ has to be halted spencer w kimball president of the mormon church stated we deplore in particular the building of vast arsenals of nuclear weaponry history indicates that men have seldon created armaments that eventually were not put to use 0 with the most serious concern over the pressing moral question of possible nuclear conflict we plead with our national leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find viable alternatives the mormon church leadership is referring to the deadly world arms race that is draining nations of their resources and revenues that otherwise would be spent on economic and social develolimentspecifically which last year exceeded 500 billion dollars and which the reagan administration in its budget proposal is contributing mightily toward i believe there is a growing sense in this body that the defense budget will undo~whatever good might resultfrom administration economic policies and i say this as one who is highly skeptical about the administrations policies if the congresssional black caulcus and a handful of socalled house liberals alone had challenged the reagan defense budget it likely would have been dismissed summarily but the caucus is not alone in its criticism of the transfer of some 50 billion in additional budget authority to dod next year we are joined by leading churches in the land by highly respectable economists and financial leaders the simple truth is that the defense budget that the administration is proposing will intensify inflation because inflationary costs in the defense sector have been running at twice the rate as in the economy overall intensify inflation because of the widely acknowledged shortages of pro may 6 1981 duction in the defense sector and in the shortages of its labor force intensify inflation because of the widely reported monopolistic practice among defense contractors the lack of competitive contract bidding at dod and the widespread lack of pentagon control over its own budget intensify inflation because in the aggregate boosts in defense spending add income but not consumer goods and services and therefore add to the class inflation of too many dollars chasing too few goods and shift badly needed investment capital away from the civilian sectors of the economy that are mnost in need of revitalization i detect among my colleagues especially on the opposite side of the aisle a growing uneasiness about the administrations and the latta0ramms defense budget that uneasiness is understandable no one has come up with a convincing argument why an additional 50 billion in defense is needed other than the ageold shibboleths about national security and the russians are coming this morning i went over some comparative figures on the relative strengths of the unitedstates defense establishment and the soviets in termsa of defense spending during the last 10 years the nato allies have outspent the warsaw pact by 207 billion according to londons international institute for strategic studies in terms of strategic nuclear warheads the best measure of relative numerical strengths the united states has 9 200 warheads as compared to 7 000 on the soviet side of equal importance the united states has far greater command control flexibility and survivability in relation to its ability to fight a nuclear war than has the soviet union for example only 25 percent of our strategic warheads are land basedand relatively vulnerableas compared to 80 percent of the soviets warheads and because of our triad of strategic forceslandbased seabased and airbasedthe united states has a wide advantage over the soviets for example 48 percent of our strategic warheads are either at sea alert or in bombers on alert as compared to 3 percent of the soviets warheads there is a shocking orthodoxy in this chamber about the need for a stronger defense establishment despite the facts and figures despite the questionability of ever winning a nuclear war however limited or of needing any more nuclear arms than we presently have as the mormon church leaders observed my col leagues especially on the other side of the aisle still cling to the panacea of more defense spending as if it were a reflex action that arises when no other solutions to our economys problems and the worlds problems are in sight i think we ought to debate many more hours the role of defense spending in the administrations budget and in relation to economic recovery we ought to debate many more hours the assumptions behind the reagan lattagramm budget and the alternative that the congressional black caucus is proposing i would now like to touch briefly upon a matter which in terms of dollars may be considered relatively insignificant in relation to the overall federal budget however it is a very important matter because of its direct bearing upon the quality of justice in this country i speak of the legal services corporation when the congress enacted the legislation establishing the legal services corporation in 1974 it made findings about the need for such a program the congress specifically found that first there is a need in this country for equal access to our system of justice second there is a need to provide highquality legal assistance to those who are unable to afford it third providing legal assistance to those facing an economic barrier to obtaining legal help serves the ends of justice fourth the availability of legal assistance has reaffirmed for many people their faith in our government of laws pifth a legal services program should be kept free of the influence of political pressures and sixth attorneys who provide legal assistance under such a program must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients just as other members of the bar have full freedom to protect their clients interests those findings are as valid and accurate today as they were in 1974 and the need for a legal services corporation today is as great as it was in 1974 continued funding of the corporation is essential if we are to keep this countrys commitment to equal justice under the law the need for the continuation of the legal services corporation has been widely recognized in addition to numerous individual private attorneys district attorneys judges state attorneys general and state governors many national organizations have called for continued funding of the corporation including the american bar association the american association of retired persons national association of retired teachers the aflcio the american coalition of citizens with disabilities the childrens defense fund the friends committee on national legislation the league of united latin american citizens lulac the lead ership conference on civil rights the national bar association the national council of churches the national council of senior citizens the national committee against discrimination in housing the national mental health association the national farmers union the national council on aging the national urban league the national legal aid and defender association the united states conference of mayors the united states catholic conference and rural america one of the announced goals of this administration is a reduction in what it refers to as unnecessary and inefficient federal regulations continuation of the legal services corporation will not frustrate that goal the legal services corporation does not engage in any substantive regulation and it is not a part of the federal bureaucracy in addition the corporations programs are locally controlled the corporation has been soundly managed and its programs have been costeffectiveit expends only 1 8 percent of its funds on management and administration and another 1 8 percent for field monitoring and evaluation continuation of the legal services corporation has bipartisan support just last monday the judiciary committees subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice unanimously reported an authorization bill for the corporation that bill authorizes 200 million for the corporation for each of the next 2 fiscal years in addition the bill addresses some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the corporation such as in the area of class action suits and lobb ying i urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to continue the important work of the legal services corporation"], [0.009920239448547363,

trouble the article tells us armed with charts on the citys declining federal assistance and rising unemployment rates the republican mayor told the republican president he could no longer respond to the needs of the jobless in cleveland then he told the president a very striking story about a man who was unemployed whom he had run into in a parking lot the article says that the mayor said there was nothing i could do for that man volnovich said he told the president he and six other big city mayors had an hourlong meeting with reagan then he is quoted again 1 got emotional in there said voinovich who had been seeking such a white house meeting for months he told reagan that people in cleveland were losing their homes and that many of them even whole families were going to soup kitchens that once were the domain of the derelicts mayor voinovich then presented many statistics about our city he told the president that in 1979 trw inc employed 8 322 people now employment is down 24 percent to 6 294 he told him that youth unemployment in cleveland has gone from 24 percent in 1979 to 38 percent today with more than half of the citys minority youth out of work he told him that bankrupticles to cleveland went from 2 772 in 1979 to 5 332 to 1981 ii7 7113 sitting there with him were mayors from detroit pittsburgh syracuse tampa phoenix and charleston then they asked what was the presidents response mayor voinovich said that the presidents response to these presentations were not in words but the expression on his face he was listening i was watching his face and he was listening every member of this body now knows the human tragedy of the reagan economic program instead of economic recovery what we have from industrial strongholds like cleveland ohio to the farm

administration has proposed is a stunning example of throwing away money in the name of national security the administration wants to spend 4 2 billion on a 7year civil defense program that just plain will not work the first installment for this grandiose and ill conceived plan is a 123 million increase for fiscal year 1983 the administrations nuclear civil defense program is based on the strangelovian notion that we can fight survive and win a nuclear war nothing could be further from the truth the administrations civil defense program is premised on the belief that the soviet civil defense program will work nothing could be more farfetched finally the administrations program assumes a fantasy island world after a nuclear attack nothing could be more dangerous to assume the intent of my amendment is quite simple instead of a 95percent increase in nuclear civil defense over the fiscal year 1982 level as the administration has proposed this amendment would bring the spending in line with that passed by senate armed services committee and the full senate and even by cutting 108 million from this massive increase we would still be increasing spending by 6 percent over last years level let me be clear civil defense in theory is a wonderful idea but we have to be realistic in this nuclear age where a nuclear conflict will result in megadeaths and megadestruction civil defense will only be a bandaid over the nuclear holocaust both the united states and the soviet union have enough nuclear weapons to destroy each other completely once a nuclear war begins there is no escape from ultimate destruction the administration is talking out of both sides of its mouth on the issue of nuclear war on the one hand it assumes that it is possible for u3 to prevent nuclear war on the other hand it wants to spend billions of dollars for a civil defense program that would supposedly be a key ingredient to fighting and winning such a war the administration states that nuclear civil defense now complements our strategic offensive forces nuclear civil defense is supposed to insure that somehow or other according to the pentagons strategy the united states must prevail and be able to force the soviet union to seek earliest termination of hostilities on terms favorable to the united states this is absurd there will be no winners in a nuclear war and we should not concoct an unrealistic civil defense plan to delude the american people into thinking that there will be winners nuclear civil defense proponents will argue that if a nuclear war should occur we need nuclear civil defense to save millions of lives but nuclear civil defense is a program riddled with illogical assumptions and unworkable details the most implausible and dangerous assumption surrounding nuclear civil defense is that a nuclear war could be limited and controlled this theory assumes that once a nuclear exchange begins both sides can rationally limit the damage do we really believe we can have such a calm and collected war nuclear civil defense proponents claim that casualties can be minimized and more than 80 percent of the population can be saved through this massive civil defense program this is pure fantasy nuclear war would leave us no matter what program we have in place with complete destruction as a society the 80percent survival figure ignores the total devastation that would come from nuclear war first it assumes that there will only be death from the blast effects of bombs it omits all other deaths from bombs burns fallout starvation and disease in short the 80percent survival figure is a fraud nothing more nothing less medical care would be largely unavailable sixtyeight percent of all american physicians are located in 71 urban areas all likely to be targets in a largescale nuclear attack and if we think the population or the percentage of the general population dying would be high it would be higher for physicians food supplies would be destroyed or made radioactive most crops are grown in areas near icbm targets even those food supplies that would survive would be nearly impossible to transport to people since the nations transportation system of railroads highways and airports would be ren dered nonusable a largescale nuclear attack would immediately destroy 50 to 90 percent of unitedstates industrial capacity think about this we hear that 80 percent of the population could survive yet only a small portion of the economy would continue to function so what do the civil defense planners base their rosy survival projec tions on here are some of the specif ics of the current civil defense plans that are supposed to save so many lives part of the federal emergency management agencys budget is for public training and education heres what a recent fema public information film envisions for a postnuclear attack world the film shows people ducking behind trees to avoid blast effects then these people emerge from the trees to put out fires with pails of water supposedly buckets of water will be enough to deal with firestorms of 800 degrees centigrade with winds of over 100 miles per hour this program is not public education it is public pacification in order to keep the economy functioning during evacuation and after attack fema has identified 4 million key workers in essential industries and what does the privilege of being a key worker entail the task of leaving your families behind and commuting into the dangerous risk area for work shifts during the evacuation period you can

not worry the department of housing and urban development will establish rent guidelines which will conform to rental schedules for comparable accommodations with possibly up to 80 to 90 percent of

plans glosses over an important point survival means nothing without a way to protect people before during and after an attack such plans do not exist and because of nuclear wars devastation they cannot exist femas survival figures assume a flawless evacuation it just will not happen that way fema assumes that every american will be willing to leave his home and all his possessions risk total separation from family members and friends in order to prove a point to the soviets yet even in a natural disaster in which lepser damage would occur fema has admitted that 20 to 30 percent of the populace would refuse to cooperate the success of femas program requires an infallible procedurebut problems abound there would be tremendous difficulty in moving prison inmates the elderly the sick and the handicapped can you imagine the traffic jams our cities will have what about cars breaking down or running out of gas who will be brave enough to stay in a risk area and pump gas who will stay at stores to sell the needed evacuation materials such as food and medicine would busdrivers be willing to transport people back and forth from risk areas to host areas would police officers and firemen stay in place to keep order rather than try to evacuate to save their lives given all of these problems successful evacuation is little more than a dream but what if we could evacuate everyone

understanding that this amendment hias been withdrawn one of the concerne that i have in this continuing argument over elk hills is the assumption that we have an immediately usable strategic petroleum reserve in elk hills the whole purpose of the salt domes in texas was to be able to extract that oil in a relatively short period of time at elk hills you simply cannot d9 that in addition we have a tremendous amount of drilling going on in elk hills and elk hills happens to be in my district in california one of the things that the sale of the elk hills oil has done is to continue to spur additional drilling in the surrounding areas of the elk hills producing a tremendous increase in the quantities of heavy crude the elk hills oil has been used in blending the heavy crude to increase california production a simple example of that is that currently kern county one county in california produces better than 600 000 barrels of oil a day this includes the portion from elk hills if we subtracted the kern county portion of oil from california kern county that single county would be number three in the united states in oil production of states behind only alaska and texas so while we certainly ought to be filling the strategic petroleum reserve so that we can extract that oil in a very quick manner and certainly we should be making sure that elk hills has the potential to produce whenever we need to to its maximum capacity one of the things i think many members of congress really ought to do is come out to my district and take a look at the amount of oil that is actually available and the amount of oil that continues to be discovered in the immediate proximity of elk hills largely because of the stimulus provided by the elk hills oil for blending purposes so when we consider the picture of what to do with elk hills i urge my colleagues to look at the entire picture in terms of the amount of heavy oil being produced that would not be produced without the benefit of the blending possibilities from the elk hills crude so when we look at this picture of petroleum of energy and of the strategic petroleum reserve we have to also look at it in the terms of elk hills ability to stimulate the production of oil in the surrounding area"], [0.9758249707520008, 0.02417502924799919, 1, "during election years one expects a lost of rhetoric for the benefit of special interest groups usually there is little action to benefit the nation or its economy but rather a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for more than a decade due to committments for social spendingand our economy in dire straits the amerian people deserve more than

saying you have led the way now well proceed many of us would like to claim bold leadership in addressing the issue of cutting government spending we cannot we are following the orders of our constituents who preceded us on this issue we now have the responsibility to carry out those orders congress own committee funding is a good place to start i support the 10percent reduction it is a significant cut yet it would not ii 1091 cripple any necessary committee action we know that some committees and subcommittees should be cut even more others should be cut less or not at all as wielders of the ax we must make discriminate chops statistics documenting the growth of government spending are so numerous as to strain our capacity for retention some point to the growth of congressional staff as a prime example of the ballooning bureaucracy well it is true congressional staff growth and the increase in committee funding levels over the past 10 years is well documented by figures the figures however only address the symptoms the disease itself remains we need to be wary of the quick cure and if we are to be responsive to the budgetcutting demands of our constituents we must look beyond the figures documenting congressional stnff growth to the reasons for this growth there is where the doctoring is really needed one reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the burgeoning bureaucracy in the executive branch executive branch personnel and funding levels have increased enormously over the past two decades new programs have been instituted with corresponding new staffs task forces have been established to study specific problems old programs have been expanded and staffs increased to handle the work load it is quite understandable that congressional committee staffs have increased commensurately just to monitor and conduct oversight investigations of increased executive branch activity we must also cut back the executive bureaucracy president reagan has promised to reduce the size of the federal work force to reduce the size and number of federal programs i believe that he is committed to this kind of a spending cut in the federal bureaucracy when this happens it should be easier for us to also reduce the sizes and budgets of our special committee staffs responsible for doing the work generated by some of these executive agencies another important reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the legislative reorganization act of 1970 this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 320 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 328 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect there will be an attempt here today by the minority to cut committee funding even more than the substantial 10percent cut proposed by the distinguished majority leader anything more than the 10percent cut would be a severe blow to the efficiency of the house committee system the purpose for such a cut is more than simply to spend less money we know that the senate now controlled by the minority has not seen fit to cut its own committee funding to this extent we know that the senate and the white house while being budget conscious in spending levels for their own staffs are still leaving themselves sufficient funds to carry out their mandated duties efficiently at the same time though there are those who would demand that the house sustain a burden of budget cutting greater than its share to the possible detriment of its efficiency and its ability to do its job i can only assume that this effort is a partisan one designed more to hamper the effectiveness of a house still with a democratic majority than to be responsive and responsible to the budgetcutting demands of the american public our president has told us that the issue of reducing federal spending at all levels is nonpartisan our constituents tell us the issue is nonpartisan

in recognition of the hazards they face in the performance of their duty i would emphasize that the hazards faced by such workers are in a sense uncontrollablethat is they cannot be controlled or reduced through the use of measures such as safety rules and inspections or protective clothing and equipment which have proven effective for other hazardous occupations i introduced h r 756 to address the fact that although federal firefighters and police face the same dangers as their state and local counterparts under often identical circumstances survivors of federal workers are not accorded the security of the death benefit what is at issue here is a basic question of equitywhether federal firefighters and law enforcement personnel deserve the death benefit that workers in the same capacities on the state and local levels already receive i submit that they do and that there is an undeniable need for an amendment of the federal employees compensation act that would allow this death benefit to be extended to them currently the death benefit for federal law enforcement officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty is limited to a continuation of salary based on a percentage of the amount the worker was earning at the time of death because less senior workers in the lower pay grades are most often in hazardous field situations where line of duty deaths occur the amount of the benefit paid to a family should that worker be killed tends to be less for example for the average federal firefighter with two or more children who is killed in the line of duty the federal employees compensation act would provide 11 849 75 percent of gs4 step 4 this amounts to an immediate 25percent reduction in income often an inadequate amount on which to support a family that

of american personnel leaving the united states to 100 percent also they could not be replaced for 30 days heretofore they could have been replaced any time the employer desired to do so but let us look at one important fact what we are dealing with is an abuse that has been precipitated by an international network of attorneys and their field operators we had evidence during the hearings that representatives of attorneys from the states were up in canada after the fatal ranger accident knocking on the doors of canadians in ambulance chasing fashion they were appalled at the approach they were not aware of what was happening that it never happened to them before that is clearly one illustration of the abuse we intend to correct they go to these foreign lands sign up the client and say sue in america american courts are very generous with their awards you can return home and live in wealth for the rest of your life that clearly is an abuse but in the process of trying to deal with the abuse we do not deny any victim of an injury the right to come to these united states when a unitedstates company is involved if there is no remedy no compensation provided in their lands for injuries occurring in the foreign watersthe outer continental shelf as another factor many of these foreign countries mandate that the american companies have a certain percentage of their employees as foreign nationals members can see the inconsistency of those who are critical if they are going to mandate it why not make the courts in those countries available for any injury incurred by a foreign national clearly this legislation has been given extensive hearings a very considerable record and we addressed ourselves to the concerns of the laboring segment in our nation no one has greater sympathy for them than i and yet there was not a scintilla of evidence we asked them time and tme again give us that evidence show us something where this will bring about a negative reaction
