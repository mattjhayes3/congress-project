the republican budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the spratt alternative budget"], [0.0026192069053649902, 0.997380793094635, 1, "we appreciate the opportunity once again to come to the floor of the house of representatives as the 30something working group myself along with kendrick meek mr meek from florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you very much fot

bottom line is that we have a republican majority that rubber stamps everything that the administration hands to them they cant even put the paper on the desk fast enough before they rubber stamp it when you start talking about the fact that by the constitution we are supposed to carry out oversight that is not a value of the republican majority li 1915 oversight of what no see they are too busy taking care of the special interests you would think that some members were more concerned with trying to make sure that special interests got what they needed because we do not want to forget the k street project where you pay to play and you get access into this republican majority house so when you look at the rubberstamping of what has happened here i cannot help but have this stamp here because that is how we got here but what is very very unfortunate is the fact that we have ourselves in a situation in a fiscal situation that is going to take a generation almost to recover from we have ourselves in a situation in iraq we do not know how many years it may take for us to recover from that and i am using the presidents words now we have ourselves in a situation where the white house now wants to invite members over to have tea and cookies right now and trying to be niceynice to say we want to hear from you now but we have men and women caught in the crossfire and we have millions and billions of dollars that have been wasted and stolen in iraq i am going to say stolen because of the rubberstamp republican majority anything that the administration sends down how can we rubberstamp it matter of fact i think the republican majority walks around with a little mini rubber stamp in their pocket saying oversight this is the way you want it and how you want it the american people have to send a very strong message to this republican majority here in the congress that we have three branches of government for a reason not two branches of government that deals with legislation and policy but three branches we have the judicial branch that is separate and aside but when you look at the legislative branch we are supposed to carry out oversight only a couple of members of the republican majority actually gets that and tries to practice it but they are in a superminority and so the reason why we come to the floor is to shed light on the lack of oversight when it was a democratic house and a democratic white house there was oversight cajl bill clinton up and ask him i think we know that republican majority the reason why you are going to see people around here scratching and fighting and begging and trying to do anything and throwing out the sods and trying to get press releases out because the white house is very very concerned that they will no longer be able to send legislation to the unitedstates house of representatives and that it passes through committees that may have a half a meeting on it and come to the floor not allowing democrats to do anything to improve the legislation because they are too busy rubberstamping the process and it will disrupt that it is all about power and influence and i can tell you right now the republican majority has gone too far with this because that is the reason why we are in the situation we are in now and they are known they have to shake it and they know it and they deserve the rubber stamp because that is what they have been doing since the president has been in the white house i am coming to ms jacksonlee i just want to give you a perfect example of what happens in a rubberstamp congress exhibit a how can you borrow 1 05 trillion in 4 years i do not even know how that can be achieved in 4 years the republican majority has handed president bush he cannot do it on his own we have the republican congress right under him from 2001 to 2005 1 05 trillion now here is the other kicker that comes in and with interest fortytwo presidents 224 years 224 years 42 presidents were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion i rest my case on that i rest my case on the fact that the republican majority has given the bush white house everything they wanted on the backs of the american people the special interests got what they wanted the billionaires got what they wanted"], [0.0026880502700805664, 0.9973119497299194, 1, "a track record a pattern of those who have made youthful indiscretions in their lives need it be on credit need it be some sort of criminal activity you can no longer have access you used to have the capital if you do not have a good credit record am i right let me just tell you something right now as it relates to the united states i am looking at japan you can put japan in the state of florida and the state of florida will swallow geographically japan but better yet look what they are holding of the unitedstates apple pie the bottom line is this is about the incompetence cronyism and in some cases corruption of these individuals being able to get access into this institution and into the executive branch to be able to get what they want i want to drive the point on here i want to make sure this is crystal clear it has to be crystal the bottom line is the only way that we will be able to have a paradigm shift not only in thinking but in policy and action on behalf of the american people and unless the american people like you say the majority they do not have to be the majority the american people can make that change they can say that we are willing to allow the democrats to lead so that we can hopefully start taking care of some of these issues that we have to take care of here at home with our troops in iraq and afghanistan and throughout the world so that we can get the respect of not only the world but our country our own country veterans they signed up for all the right reasons allowing us to salute one flag as we see it now are being asked to do more financially meanwhile 1 5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy while we have individuals while we are having veterans affairs centers closing in rural america and in urban america they are closing some of them are only open on wednesday now but meanwhile we have individuals we have the president every time he gets a chance he is talking about let us make the tax cuts permanent for people who are not even asking for it so this is very simple this speech on what the majority republicans say well trust us we know what we are doing we showed the letter from secretary snow i think we already know this we did not write this letter the guy has said the fifth time the secretary is saying we will not be able to operate the government that is one letter here is the other one here fortytwo presidents this president and republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion but better yet saying let us make a bad idea permanent let us drive this number up let us put a two here instead of a one it does not make sense only the american people can stop this crowd

here it is almost too much to share we do not have enough time to share what the members and the american people clients reward keeping k street lobbyists thriving i never blame the special interests for what happens here but i am going to tell you right now they have a tax shelter right now where 100 billion in unitedstates taxpayer dollars are not going into the coffers because they have an offshore deal with this administration and with this majority meanwhile we are sitting around here trying to figure out how our veterans are going to get health care meanwhile we are trying to figure how small businesses will be able to afford health care for everyday americans to be able to buy into and meanwhile we have troops still without body armor and the things they need to be able to fight on behalf of this country so we ask everyday americans to go out there and suck it up meanwhile the majority the republican majority based on incompetence some may say corruption in some cases as it relates to the white house i mean every day i am sorry every day we turn on the television what is new what is going on at the white house what is being held back from the american people what is being held back from the congress who came to the hill today and conflicted a story that they told just months ago about the fiscal outlook on the country meanwhile you have members that come up to this well on the majority side and say we are doing fine i do not know what these democrats are talking about but it goes against logic we have letters from their very own administration that are

our debate is going out across the country thanks to cspan and i think it is very important that we understand that the american people have awakened all of the polls show it the american people are glued in to what is happening here in washington and right they should be i want to start off by saying that so that individuals who are tuning in who would like to know just what are the blue dogs more than anything else we pride ourselves on being first and foremost good stewards of the taxpayers dollars we provide the sterling leadership in the democratic party for responsible fiscal responsibility for 5 years we in the blue dog coalition have been begging and pleading that this congress develop a plan to pay as you go mr speaker 5 years ago when the clinton administration left office we had a surplus billions and billions and billions of dollars were left in surplus now 5 years later under the bush administration we are trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars in debt make no mistake about it our debt and our deficit is the number one problem and issue facing the survival and the future of our democracy and we are concerned about this national debt but at a time when we are expressly concerned about it and pushing forward for responsible measures onthe democratic side it is the height of hypocrisy it is the height of being insensitive it is the height of indeed smoke and mirrors for this republicanled congress and this republican president to under the guise of giving a tax cut for billionaires and millionaires across this country say he wants to cut spending cut spending of the most vital services the most important needs in this country as a matter of fact in the history of this country in this 20th century we have just been hit with the worst hurricane season in modern times katrina was the worst that anybody can remember billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of damage an entire city entire region almost totally destroyed over 250 000 american citizens without homes we all remember those pictures down in new orleans in the flood our hearts went out to those people well our hearts must continue to go out to those people and the reason it is the height of hypocrisy is here is the president of the united states and this republican controlled congress who says that they want to offset a 70 billion tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country on the backs of those poor victims of this hurricane on the front page of the washington post this morning the answer from fema is to throw 150 000 american citizens who have become homeless on the street the answer from the white house and the answer from this congress has been to cut the very programs that will help these victims the most the most effective programs that have helped them has been the food stamp program and under this budget this republican held congress and this president proposes to cut food stamps by 850 million not only at a time when we have people who are homeless without jobs without hope but according to the agriculture department just this year alone we have added 2 million more citizens to the hunger roles the republicans answer cut the very program that has been designed to help them by 850 billion medicaid under this budget planned by the republicans and president bush they want to cut medicaid by 12 billion when 45 million americans mostly senior elderly citizens are going without any kind of health insurance and our farmers cut them by 2 billion farmers who have been devastated by the flood who have been hurt by the flood now is not the time to cut the farmers and our veterans 3 billion lord knows we have not been doing right by our veterans we have cut them we have cut them we have cut them and the presidents answer is cut the veterans this republican congresss is to cut the veterans is that not a reason why they have had difficulty in getting the votes why they have had to pull the bill last week and the american people need to wake up and understand and put the calls in to your republican congressman to let them know that america does not want to cut the basic services for the needy while trying to add a 70 billion tax cut for the millionaires and the billionaires they do not need the money but the children do this budget will cut childrens nutrition by 2 billion and 5 billion in child support heating oil is cut at a time when the oil companies are getting record profits and their execputives are sitting fast student loans 14 billion at a time when going to college costs so much there will be tens of thousands of american children who will not go to college if this republican budget reconciliation bill passes that is why this is so important that is why it is important listen to me america and if you know other people tell them to tune in we are here to tell you the facts this blue dog coalition is one of the most influential groups on capitol hill and the reason why is because people trust us we have earned that we have earned that distinction folks like charlie stenholm john tanner they have pioneered and set the curve respect across party lines respect across this country the blue dog coalition we are speaking the truth tonight william shakespeare said it well when he wrote that great play julius caesar when he said et tu brutus yours is the meanest cut of all and that is what these republicans are doing in this bill it is mean it is cold and it is wrong and the american people deserve better and we are going to give them better so mr ross and my

have reams and reams o f paper about how government is not working now is the fact that we are governing under a culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence one cannot operate a business under a culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence they cad just not do it they cannot do it it is impossible to achieve and it is wrong so when we have historic levels of corruption incompetence and cronyism it is just hard for us to govern in that way people are wondering why am i picking up my newspaper not only seeing indictments but seeing plea agreements by the very people that are elected to come up here to govern on behalf of the american people so why is it even shocking to some members why we have so much corruption in the federal system and we come in here as though let me grab a cup of coffee or a latte like it is another day at the office it is not another day at the office it is not another day here in congress we are concerned but maybe the majority could also get a little concerned about what is g6ing on let me just mention something because mr delahunt just hit a couple of points and i just want to mention something because here in the 30something working group as my colleagues know and others and i am so glad that mr ryan claimed this hour the bottom line is this we have a white house where members of the white house have been indicted or previous members who resigned the day before they were indicted and serious national security breaches in the white house this is not hearsay this is fact we have federal investigators now they are not talking about someone who took a trip somewhere on the governments credit card they are not talking about that you know someone went to lunch with someone and you know the bill was 3 000 and they had eight lobsters they are not talking about that they are talking about outing cia agents they are talking about information being leaked out that is jeopardizing national security they are also talking about issues as it relates to you know the influence of the private sector and corruption and not possible cronyism but cronyism and incompetence that is what is going on here now and even here in the congress unprecedented investigations inquires not by the congress but by other agencies that are policing us so when people start saying well why is all of this happening it is happening because we are not well the congress the majority is not governing the way that they should govern and policing themselves i think it is important as we look at this culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence that we put it in the right perspective we know that a lot of this is allegations we will just say allegations i want to make sure that we say that but i want to also make sure that members know exactly what is going on this is not regular business in the congress the 109th congress historians will reflect and in the present will say this has never happened before in the historyof the republic so when folks start talking about well you know i do not know what you are talking about i am going to tell you another thing they are coming to the floor the majority tomorrow to pass tax cuts on behalf of billionaires and millionaires meanwhile just before we left here they cut student loans cut medicaid cut child support enforcement somebody please tell me this is a misprint but it is not and going after deadbeat dads so i wonder how the state attorneys and sheriffs are going to feel about that they cut many programs that we need in this country meanwhile back at the ranch we are going to turn our back on what is going on in iraq and what is going on here in washington d c as though it is not a big deal so i think the gentleman from massachusetts is in order when he talks about some of the decisions that are being made and one of any colleagues on this side said just because the republican leadership says it is true does not mean that it is true we were here on this

ryan of ohio we are tired of you are in debt you do not continue to the rhetoric uncle bill use a credit card so if americans want ms wasserman schultz mr to do away with the 882 8 billion that ryan how many americans do you japan owns we will pull this off the think think it is okay to just put all chart cina if you want to do away their debt on their credit card and with the 249 8 billion that china owns never mind how muchmoney they have right now of our debt and pay as we coming in go and we have evidence and third mr ryan of ohio you cannot do it party validators that will be explained at home ms wasserman schultz to the american people and the mem ms wasserman schultz but i bers have a democratic congress the guess the republican leadership think u k you want to get rid of the 223 2 here it is fine billion in foreign debt that they own of mr ryan of ohio they are taking our country i am destroying this advantage of their power and it is chart here but get a democratic con hurting the country june 17 of 2003 gress because we have shown we bal mr obey tried to increase port secuanced the budget and we are com rity which is another huge issue we mitted to doing this because we believe have been trying to do here 500 milin the way we believe when we were lion and we will go through all this elected that we are here to represent all these charts will be on our web the people caribbean nations many of site for other members to our folks are going and traveling to the access and find out we have tried concaribbean and saying oh how great sistently to increase funding for port america is well when you land there security and we will pay for it we they are owning a piece of the amer have tried to rein in spending repubican pie so you need to respect them lican congress will not let us we will be able to do away with that ms jacksonlee of texas if i may 115 3 billion that we owe them tai add to your question if you would i do wan 71 3 billion they own of our debt not think most americans know that thanks to the republican congress and 70 percent of the nations ports are to the president of the united states owned by foreign operators of course also canada 53 8 billion korea 66 5 to hear this administration tell the billion germany 65 7 billion opec story they tell you of course that does nations and you know mr delahunt not interfere with security the coast iknow that is your specialty i do not guard handles it what they do not tell really want to talk about that but you is the coast guard makes checks those are nations that we are very con on compliance they do not handle the cerned about at this time that they security operation of our ports so this own 67 8 billion is an important issue that was rejected so if you want to get the reverse fac by the republican congress time after tor of what the republicans have done time every time we try to rebuild in putting us in unprecedented debt no america put america on the right other time in the history track eliminate a 3 trillion debt of the republic no other time you can limit republicans turn the clock back not say well the democratic congress i think the democrats have a better was once at this level that was not story to tell for the american people ever the case in 4 years this has hap ms wasserman schultz no pened the mismanagement question about it i want to follow up on something that the gentlewoman from texas focused on because a lot of people in america even i have a hard time getting my mind around what a billion and a trillion is it is hard to think about it in everyday terms so we had it boiled down in very convenient chart form to help illustrate what a billion is for example a billion hours ago humans were making their first tools in the stone age a billion minutes ago it was 104 ad and the chinese first invented paper a billion seconds ago it was 1975 and the last american troops had just pulled out of vietnam all of those things a very long time ago a billion is a big big number clearly measured in terms of time but a billion dollars ago under this administration and this republican congressional leadership was only 3 hours and 32 minutes ago at therate that our government currently spends money that is astonishing that is what it means when you think about what a billion means under this republican leadership"],

than the one that saves 27 5 billion more in interest than the republican budget i cannot imagine that my good friend on the floor of the house would not welcome the opportunity of putting that interest into the needs of the american people we need affordable housing we can go to any city any rural community and not see people standing in line to access affordable housing section 8 touchers which allows affordable housing for families of four and five and six hardworking american there are 25 000 people on the list in houston texas alone millions of people are still on the list because they do not have affordable housing f 1245 finally i congratulate the gentleman from virginia and the gentleman from north carolina on this budget because it also invests in homeland security with all of the talk of the republican budget they do not fund immigration and customs officers they do not fund border patrol officers to secure our borders and provide for internal security the cbc budget does the obc budget puts 150 million in for border and customs needs this is a strong budget for the american people vote for the congressional black caucus budget save 27 5 billion in interest i think you will like that in your pocket and in your savings account i rise today to offer another choice to those americans who are disheartened by the current budget proposal being offered by this republican congress today we offer them the choice of accepting the congressional black caucuss cbc alternative budget truly it is the budget of hope and compromise it is the budget that closes the disparities in americas communities the cbc alternative budget provides both social and economic equality for americans instead of allowing the richest americans to pay fewer taxes at the expense of vital programs needed by lower and middle class americans surely this administration and the republican leadership in congress will pay lip service to the needs of these americans but this budget does more it demonstrates in writing that under our current budgetary situation it is possible to maintain necessary social programs while practicing true fiscal responsibility the cbc alternative budget is particularly strong in its support of educational programs the greatest key we possess to close disparities in our society this administration and the majority in this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged on their promise the republican budget eliminates 48 education programs that receive 4 3 billion this year these eliminations include wiping out 1 3 billion for all vocational education programs 522 million for all education technology programs and 29 million for all civic education programs the republican budget eliminates other large programs including the even start family literacy program 225 million and state grants for safe and drugfree schools and communities 437 million in fact the presidents budget cuts 2006 funding for the department of education by 1 3 billion below the amount needed to maintain purchasing power at the current level and by 530 million below the 2005 enacted level of 56 6 billion this is the first time since 1989 that an administration has submitted a budget that cuts the departments funding the cbc alternative budget in stark contrast provides a much needed boost of 23 9 billion to education and training including 2 5 billion for school construction the cbc alternative fully funds the fiscal year 2006 authorization level for no child left behind nclb and provides for an expansion of the head start program in addition the cbc alternative doubles federal funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions again closing the disparities often witnessed in higher education in that regard the cbc alternative increases the pell grant allotment for college students because as we all know a mind any mind is a terrible thing to waste clearly the cbc alternative emphasizes this ideal more than the republican budget resolution few things are more important to americans than their home and their communities while the president and this republican congress take steps to make it harder for average americans to reach homeownership the cbc alternative invests heavily in this vital sector it funds home ownership initiatives that help families build real wealth in the city of houston alone we have 25 000 people waiting on a list to obtain affordable housing these homes will provide them the stability and equity to build their lives and eventually achieve their own prosperity we shame ourselves when we deny them the opportunity to do so the cbc alternative also restores 1 122 billion for vital community block grants which were gutted in the republican budget resolution without the ability to build up our communities how can we change peoples realities without community development we allow these disparities to continue unabated the cbc alternative budget does not remove any money from the overall defense and homeland security budget instead it takes 7 7 billion out of the ballistic missile defense program which has so far proven to be a failure and redirects the money to additional support for the troops in iraq homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits among the items of support for the troops in iraq is 75 million of body armor personal support equipment and other protective gear for troops and vehicle armor all of which we know the troops are in urgent need of the cbc alternative provides an additional 2 05 billion for homeland security including funds for improving rail and port security which have always been high risk targets for attack this alternative budget provides 4 65 billion for veterans funding so that when our brave men and women return home from fighting the war on terror they will know that their nation is ready and willing to take care of them the cbc alternative also funds the important sector of immigration as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i worked with the cbc to get funding for 150 million for immigration and customs enforcement ice agents and border patrol agents truly we are undermanned in this vital sector in addition as a member of the house science committee i worked with the cbc to fund an additional 500 million for general science space and development and support the research and development efforts of nasa the national science foundation nsf the national institute of standards and technologies nist and the department of energy in addition to research and development the cbc alter native also supports additional safety measures for the space shuttle program which should be at the forefront of nasas efforts after the columbia space shuttle tragedy space and science represent yet another way to eliminate disparities through knowledge and discovery this cbc alternative budget is proof positive that we can properly fund social programs while still paying down more of the hational debt than the republican budget again i say that this budget represents hope instead of the despair we feel when looking at the republican budget resolution it id a hope for ending the disparities that continue to divide us and keep us to this day from achieving our full potential as a nation"],

have passed but for republican votes and the republican president signed the budgets that is what this crowd has offered they have done it all what has that meant three trillion dollars of additional deficit spending that is what it has meant this budget continues that practice the overwhelming majority of americans now believe that our great nation is headed in the wrong direction not difficult to understand why they think that the republican partys incompetence over the past 512 years is undeniable from the miscalculations in iraq to the inept response to hurricane katrina to failure to secure our ports and borders to the historic turnaround in our fiscal health from the 5 6 trillion surplus that they inherited which they have turned into a 4 trillion deficit a 9 6 trillion turnaround in 64 months 5 4 million more americans live in poverty 6 million more are uninsured real median household income has dropped nearly 1 700 thus today it is stunning that our republican colleagues have brought a budget resolution to this floor that so badly betrays our values and fails to meet our nations priorities this shamefully shortsighted budget resolution cuts crucial investment in our nation and our people the difference i tell my friend from wisconsin is we want to pay for what we buy you are buying a lot you are buying more than we bought when we were in charge you are not paying you are borrowing from the japanese the chinese the saudis you borrowed more money from foreigners over the last 5 years than were borrowed in the 210 years before that over the next 5 years it slashes education by 45 billion veterans health care to which the gentleman referred by 6 billion public health by 18 billion and environmental protection by 25 billion even worse this budget resolution is a continuation of the most reckless fiscal policies in the history of our nation policies that have squandered as i said a 5 6 trillion budget surplus who said that george bush march 2001 said that is what we had they added more than 3 trillion to the national debt and weakened our ability weakened our ability to respond to national and international crises listen my friends to the warning of the nonpartisan comptroller general david walker not a democrat appointed by your side who stated in february continuing on the unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode if not suddenly damage our economy our standard of living and ultimately our national security that is what mr walker says their budgets are doing to america yet that is precisely what this republican budget continues to do it not only fails to rein in the record republican deficits of the last 5 years it makes them worse hear me this budget makes the deficits worse it not only fails to arrest our exploding national debt it calls for a debt limit increase of 653 billion additional dollars last year during our debate on the budget resolution the chairman of the budget committee confidently proclaimed and i quote we will be able to give i believe our kids and grandkids the opportunities of a debtfree world if we begin with a small step again this year that is the chairman who brings to this floor a 653 billion additional increase in our national debt the chairmans assertion then has been eviscerated by the facts now vote for this responsible spratt alternative and reject this fiscally reckless proposal on top of the last five fiscally reckless proposals the reality is this budget resolutionand the republican partys policieshave instigated a dangerous spiral of deficits and debt that constitute nothing less than fiscal child abuse because they will immorally force our children and grandchildren to pay our bills in sharp contrast the democratic alternative is reasonable and responsible it would balance the budget by 2012 reinstate the payasyougo budget rules that were instrumental in creating four consecutive budget surpluses in the 1990 s and invest in our nation

know that makes our world war ii veterans feel pretty comfortable right about now and i am saying that in a way that 1 know that they are highly upset at the point that japan can come back and own so

the american apple pie buying our debt our debt historic debt that we have given them in the last 4 years and i am going to explain that a little further mr ryan because i think people need to understand that prior t6 this republican congress and president bush being elected there were surpluses that means that folks were projecting not a deficit but money left over for things that we need to tackle yes we need a middleclass tax cut yes we need to shore up social security yes we need to have a health care plan so that businesses dont have to ask people to be on medicaid to pay for their

that we are bringing into question let me just let the members take a look at this map empty without the debt on it i think it is important that members understand that democrats we are the only party in this house that has actually balanced the budget people can talk about it they can write great studies about it but until you do it you dont know what it takes obviously based on those letters from secretary snow ind based on the fact that the republican congress has taken pride in endorsing everything that the president has said we want to give millionaires a tax break and give middle class people a 10 tax break or a 50 tax break done we want to give oil companies as a matter of fact i read this last night i think it is important and i am going to read it again since i passed by a gas station today and it was 3 07 right here in washington dc this is a washington post article dated november 16 of 2005 the white house documents show that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long suspected by environmentalists but denied as of november 2005 last week by industry officials testifying before congress the document obtained by the washington post shows that officials from exxonmobil also from phillips and shell oil company and bp of america met in the white house complex with vice president cheneys aides in developing a national energy policy parts of which became law parts of which are still debated in congress i rest my case on that again republican congress said energy bill mr president so shall it be written so shall it be done without a question asked do you want to go down to the whole issue of what is happening with our seniors now prescription drugs so shall it be written so shall it be done propane from the republican congress we will do it because you told us to do it all this debt that i have right here under this stamp mr president do you want to raise the debt limit okay fine we are rightwith you let us raise the debt limit on the back of americans meanwhile i must add that when we look at raising the debt limit they are cutting student aid to students to be able to be our workforce in the future and to be able to afford a college education i am glad to announce that this is actually a bill proposed by democrats here in this house this is not a democratic proposal this is an american proposal i believe that americans are sick and tired of being sick and tired this is legislation that is now filed by representative miller here in this house land also from senator dick durbin in the senate reversing the rate on student loans or student aid the bill cuts interest rates from 6 8 percent to 3 4 percent for students with subsidized loans which can go to students

what you need is a 12step program on spending it is called intestinal fortitude it is called having a spine it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why

up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat

the privilege and the honor of addressing you here on the floor of the house of representatives i was listening to the presentation by the 30something group here over the last hour and quite often it redirects the message that i intend to come down to this floor to discuss and of course this evening is no different being a proud and committed member of the republican party and when i hear continually the message rubberstamp congress rubberstamp congress come out over here andin the same breath the question the president wants to privatize social security i dont know anybody that has advocated for the privatization of social security i dont think you can find any seated member ofthe republican congress or the president himself that has said i want to privatize social security so that is a scare tactic that is designed to spook people but it surely is not something that is an objective revelation of the truth the president did though invest significant capital in reform of social security it was the centerpiece in his second inaugural address and after his second inaugural address with great optimism and enthusiasm the president went out and invested month after month after month in an effort to reform a social security program that will ultimately collapse reform it for not for the senior citizens there was nothing in his proposal for the people who were 55 year old and up there is not a way that we can make the actuarial numbers change that we keep our faith and keep our sacred covenant with the senior citizens that is something that is clear throughout everybody in this republican conference and all the people that are involved in this policy that i know of keep the faith with the senior citizens i represent perhaps the most senior congressional district in america iowa has the largest percentage of its population over the age of 85 of any of the states in the union and in the congressional district that i represent the 32 counties in western iowa i have 10 of the 12 most senior counties in iowa so i will argue that i represent a higher percentage of seniors perhaps than anyone else in the country and yet they understand that we will keep our sacred covenant with the seniors we will hold those benefits together there was nothing proposed by the president nothing introduced by any member of this republican conference that would have reduced by a single dime one single benefit to any senior citizen what was proposed was that a portion of young peoples contributions to social security could go into a personal retirement account a controlled account the kind of an account that would be an approved account that would be the same thing as the federal retirement investment funds that many of us are part of many federal employees are a part of in fact all of them that have the ability to direct some of their funds into retirement do invest into that it was a wise and a prudent proposal it was something that looked downrange we know that social security starts to go into the red in about 2016 2017 there is 1 7 trillion in th6 social security trust fund it is only a promise they are only ious in a filing cabinet in parkersburg west virginia that money will have to be paid back out of the labor of our children someday but the surplus growth stops in 2017 and it begins to decline until about 2042 where it is gone 0l 2145 at that point something has to happen the presidents looking downrange a lot of us have looked downrange we didnt get to change the social security program as much as we would have liked to we didnt propose to for our senior citizens because you simply cannot do that because there is not time to grow funds so the proposal was for whom i will submit the proposal that the president burned up so much precious political capital on was for the 30something group and the 20something group and the teensomething group and the youngerthanteensomething group and for all generations yet to be born in america to be able to own a part of their own future to be able to invest that and to be able to count on the same type of returns we have guaranteed as a sacred covenant to our seniors that is what that is about and that is why it is so ironic that the 30something group has rejected the very thing that is designed for their generation and mischaracterized it in a very cynical fashion and called it the privatization of social security it is anything but but it would be and it is still the best and only legitimate policy that has been offered before this congress that can bring us out of almost certain bankruptcy of social security downrange at a point where it will not be a factor to our senior citizens but for the 30something group who have rejected it and decided to scare everyone in america for cynical political reasons the statement was also made by the gentleman from florida that the only party that has balanced the budget is the democratic party and that was without a single republican vote how can a statement like that be passed off here on the floor and not be challenged we know when the budget was balanced it was balanced after and only after republicans took the majoritsr in the united states congress and that happened in 1994 i will say that the young people that came in here in this congress and took over the majority in 1994 were committed fiscally responsible people that came here to make a difference and they did they squeezed that budget down they challenged president clinton and they took this thing down to thepoint where president clinton refused to allow a continuing resolution that would have kept the government operating the government was shut down not because republicans spent too much money but because they hadnt spent enough money and so the challenge laid government was shut down who would have to give in finally republicans said okay we will give you a little more money mr president if that is what it takes to keep the government running to keep things open to keep services going to needy people we will keep the government running by giving you some more money and in spite of that they still balanced the budget the republican majority in this congress balanced the budget in spite of president clinton not because of him and it sure in the world was not without a single republican vote it was only with republican votes i guess i will say that it was with relublican ladership and republican votes and perhaps some on the other side of the aisle did vote for that they might make that argument so i will just concede that point but it surely wasnt democrats balancing this and it wasnt without a single republican vote again the allegation a streamline of rubber stamping think about that statement a streamline of rubber stamping this republican congress rubber stamping the president if that had been the case the 30something group and the rest of america would have had social security reform they would have had the kind of program that would have allowed the younger generations to take a portion of their contributions and invest them so that they could ensure their own financial security if it had been a rubber stamp congress the president would have gotten what he wanted with social security reform and i would have loved to have given it to him because it was a good plan and a good proposal but there wasnt a rubber stamp because there were enough republicans that were i will say attacked relentlessly in their political campaigns by these kind of scare tactics that intimidated them to the point where they backed away from the social security reform and we didnt quite have the 218 votes to do the thing that was best for america no rubber stamp for the president because this congress does think for itself it is 435 independent minds and it is 230 or 231 republicans that absolutely come here with a mission in mind and they draw their own conclusions they represent their districts and they represent the people in their districts and their carry their values here we didnt have enough of a consensus and i am frustrated i would have liked to have rubber stamped that because i had a chance to look at it and it was a good program but we couldnt do it then if this is a rubber stamp congress it seems to me that the president came before the american people on about january 6 of 2004 and he made a speech that i will call the guest worker speech and it was a major policy speech on whatthe president would have liked to have seen with immigration now he did speak somewhat to enforcement but i never got the thread in that speech that that was the message at all he wanted a guest worker temporary worker program and he said without that we cant enforce the law on the rest of the criminals and the drug dealers that are coming across the border i dont agree with him on that i think we have to cut down on that huge 4 million annual number of illegals that huge human haystack coming across the border and we have to seal the border we have taken steps to do that today but if the president would have had a rubber stamp congress he would have long ago when he asked for a guest worker program from this congress and he went out hustling across this country speaking over and over again of the need for a guest worker and temporary worker program he would have had that he would have had it a long time ago if this had been a rubber stamp congress so there are three powerful things really wrong with the earlier statements the rubber stamp itself is utterly wrong we would have had social security if it had been a rubber stamp congress and we would have had a guest worker program if it was a rubber stamp congress it was not and those are probably two of the highest priorities the president has brought to this congress in the 109th congress and neither one are law today or likely to become law any time soon let me say also that when i listened to the gentleman from florida say we have to rewrite that cartoon that is a caricature that comes out here on the floor of congress on a regular basis he says i also have some facts over here well i dont think the word also is going to apply because from what i saw they were not facts they were not even solid opinions then another statement that was made by the gentleman from florida was we dont have health care in america we dont have health care in america there is nobody in america that doesnt have health care everyone has access to health care including the 12 or 22 million illegals that come into this country and show up at our emergency rooms everyone has access to health care no one is denied emergency health care yes there are people that are uninsured and maybe more would be insured if someone was ever denied health care but they are not because we are a compassionate nation and we take care of people in this country we do not slam the door at any clinic or any hospital in the emergency room when people need help we at a minimum stabilize them and generally we provide them with adequate care as a matter of fact it isnt just people in america that have access to health care it is people that live on our borders i~ho have access to free american health care a case in point would be that several months ago i was down on the southern border at sasabe arizona and there at the port of entry station as i walked in there to talk to some of the border patrol officers and as i was speaking with the commander of that shift we had only spoken for a minute or two when he got an emergency call and he said excuse me i have to take care of this so he stepped away and made some calls and when he came back he said well there has been a knifing on the other side of the border just within a mile or so there is a community on the south side there that comes right up to the border and yes it is a smugglers community and it swells by about 2 000 during the day and those 2 000 disappear at night and a new bunch comes back again they smuggle drugs through in holes through our border a couple points to the east and a couple points to the west of that port of entry that allows legal traffic through and perhaps 150 to 180 vehicles a day come through that port of entry at sasabe arizona and the estimate is that two crossings east and two crossings west all four of them have more illegal traffic than there is legal traffic going through sasabe but there when i stood in sasabe arizona there was the emergency call the commander of that shift made the calls and found out that there had been a fight on the other side of the border and likely was over a drug deal and that there was a young male individual say in his early 20s who was knifed over there and the ambulance was coming from mexico into the united states so our border patrol agent and this being a routine act that happens as he told me perhaps four times a quarter so 16 times a year what are the odds i would be standing there when that happened but he made the calls routine he called two unitedstates ambulances to come to that port of entry to meet the mexican ambulance that was coming across the border and he called the helicopter out of tucson to come down and pick him up so they could life flight that person of questionable character who had been knifed in a fight that was likely over a drug conflict life flight him up to the university mercy hospital at tucson well as i stood there we talked about that and the two ambulances he had called from the unitedstates arrived i would say shortly after the ambulance came in from mexico it was about 15 minutes for the ambulance from mexico and perhaps 25 minutes for the ambulances to come from the unitedstates to that port of entry the mexican ambulance was just simply a meat wagon it looked like an ambulance on the outside on the inside there was a gurney and a wounded young male that had been knifed underneath the rubs up into the liver at the time they didnt know if he had a punctured lung or not but he needed oxygen the unitedstates ambulances had oxygen the mexican ambulance did not the mexican ambulance had surgical gloves and maybe a touch or two of bandages here or there no medicine no oxygen hardly anything to treat him with so the unitedstates ambulances came in they put oxygen on him stabilized his condition and got him to where he had as much care as they could provide then the helicopter landed they loaded him on it and took him off to tucson to the intensive care unit up there this was a mexican national wounded in a fight in mexico brought into the united states for health care through the port of entry and the word is paroled to the hospital in the united states for the purposes of saving his life and the medical people did save his life and i dont object to that i dont think you can let people die we do not let them die we dont let them die outside the emergency rooms of our hospitals or our clinics in fact we bring people into the united states on a parole to give them free health care in order to save their life because we are a humanitarian nation the statement that we dont have health care in america couldnt be more false not only do we have health care for everyone in america we have health care for people that are wounded outside of america and brought in here when we know there isnt a chance in the world they will pay a single dime for that and by the way i went to the hospital the next day to visit that individual and i looked at the accounting on the cost and it was roughly 30 000 to fix him up and send him back to his home country he was a rough looking individual but he looked a lot better the next day than he did the night he was knifed in the liver so health care for everybody in america health care for people outside of america it is false to say people dont have health care the picture of the handshake between prime minister nouri almaliki and mahmoud ahmadinejad because they shook hands somehow the implication is or the 30something group would have you believe that that is some kind of a bond between iraq and iran and now they are going to conspire against the united states for what purpose first i would submit that i have shaken hands with a lot of people and i generally smile when i do that i would wonder if there is anyone that serves in this congress out of the 435 that hasnt at some point shaken hands with their opponent in their political race doesnt mean they are your enemy they are not they are just your opponent but we shake hands with all kinds of people and the implication cannot be drawn because that two national leaders shook hands that omehow they are conspiring not at all what one can presume from that is that they have diplomatic relations and those diplomatic relations then can turn into something good rather than something bad from 1980 until 1988 the iranians and the iraqis fought each other and over a million people were killed in that conflict i dont think anyone in the world wants to see that again i am glad they are shaking hands i dont expect they are conspiring in fact i dont think so because i listened to the speech that was given here on the floor of this congress by prime minister nouri almaliki and the statement was made by the gentleman from florida that the prime minister said bad things about israel here on this floor so i took the trouble to download the speech and read every single word in this and looked for any reference to israel whatsoever good or bad 2200 i am going to include this for the record and challenge anyone in america to find a reference to israel in this speech by prime minister maliki if they can find some oblique reference iwould be very interested in what he might have said that could be interpreted by the gentleman from florida as being a bad thing about israel as i read through the speech i found some interesting statements that should be brought up rebuttals to the remarks made as the picture was held up here tonight one of the statements by prime minister maliki was speaking of september 11 your loss on that day was a loss of all mankind and our loss today is a loss for all free people he continued and wherever humankind suffers a loss at the hands of terrorists it is a loss of all humanity we are bound in this together he continued it is your duty and our duty to defeat this terror iraq is the front line in this struggle and history will prove that the sacrifices of iraqis for freedom will not be in vain iraqis are your allies in the war on terror do you think admadinejad might have downloaded the speech he has to be aware of this because this speech was as public as anything that the prime minister of iraq has ever done i am proud of the words he spoke here and lie could feel that he meant it he spoke about history will record the bravery and the humanity but he said the fate of your country and ours is tied the fate of iraq and that of the united states is tied should democracy be allowed to fail in iraq and terror permitted to triumph then the war on terrof will never be won elsewhere this statement made by prime minister maliki here on the floor of this congress not that long ago july 26 2006 is a seminal statement of this global war on terror and the seminal statement of the political campaigns that are going on between now and november 7 because the american people need to understand what happens if ve dont persevere and ultimately succeed with a free country in iraq prime minister malikis statement the fate of our country and yours is tied should democracy be allowed to fail in iraq and terror permitted to triumph then the war on terror will never be won elsewhere think of the implications of that statement the war on terror will never be won elsewhere if we should not persevere in iraq as many on this side of the aisle would like to do sack up their bats and go home that is the attitude i pick up they are trying to convince us we cannot prevail in fact i happened to have read at least significant parts of von clausewitzs book on war he states that the object of war is to destroy the enemys will and ability to conduct war the enemys will and ability to conduct war i reduce that down into the steve king vernacular which is a war is over when the losing side realizes they have lost there is will and ability as stipulated by von clausewitz in his book on war and part of the object of war is to destroy their ability militarily to conduct war and to destroy their will when they run out of men and material it breaks their will down but the strengthi of the will to conduct war is an integral part of the strength of a nation if you can break down that will it is cheaper to break down the will than the military it is cheaper in lives it is cheaper in treasure so a very essential part of conducting war is to destroy the enemys will to fight instead we have people on the floor of this congress that continually every opportunity they get come down here and they must forget at least that is the best characterization i can come up with they must forget when they speak here their words are taken down and their words are reflected across through the internet their words are transmitted around the world and the leaders of our enemy al qaeda and other terrorist groups as well as their rankandfile members ate watching on aljazeera they are watching on the internet they are watching as these words unfold and they are encouraged by the words of defeat that i hear on the other side of the aisle in the end it costs american lives but prime minister maliki of iraq said the war on war will never be won els ewhere should we allow ourselves to fail in iraq imagine if we deployed troops out of iraq pulled them back inside this shore curled america into a fetal position and guarded every school every baseball game and football game every bus stop and hospital and still watched the attacks come especially on our women and children turn the united states of america into one huge israel but no matter where terrorists attack us we could never launch another foreign exposition because politically we could not get it out of this congress because they would point and say it is another iraq look we lost in iraq some of the people on the other side of the aisle went to iraq and surrendered before we liberated them now they are redefining what failure is and saying i predicted it we cannotlet this country fail we have a destiny that we need to fulfill and that destiny promotes freedom throughout the globe and throughout the ages maliki said in his speech iraqis have tasted freedom and we will defend it absolutely he was interrupted with thunderous applause for that statement and he reached out to us and let us know that it is radical islam not islam that is our enemy he gave us a line from the koran he said god says in the koran notice he referenced god surely we have honored all children of adam the brotherhood of man and woman is tied together in the reference to the koran made by prime minister maliki he said i believe these human rights are not an artifact a constyuct reserved for the few they are a divine entitlement for all what an american vision what a statement to make on the floor of congress it resonates with patriotic americans it resonates with all people he continued it is on this unwavering belief that we are determined to build our nation a land whose people are free whose air is liberty and where the rule of law is supreme he continued and said this is the new iraq which is emerging from the ashes of a dictatorship despite the carnage of extremists a country which represents international conventions and practices noninterference in the international affairs of others just a portion of this speech nothing in here about israel there is plenty in here about freedom and about the aspirations of a newly freed people as i have looked them in the eye over in iraq in the times that i have been there i have seen that desire to build a country and a nation i gave a speech to the baghdad chamber of commerce on a hot august day and they asked me shortly before we arrived at the hotel in baghdad it was the hotel that was rocketed while wolfowitz was there some few years ago and so i said yes it fits in my schedule i will do that i walked in the room the count was 57 iraqis and members of the chamber of commerce sitting at their dinner tables they started to introduce me but time was short i wanted to know where is my interpreter they said we dont have an interpreter this chamber of commerce speaks english i thought that is quite unusual to be in a country like iraq and be able to address a group of people 57 strong business leaders in baghdad and have them all speaking english i gave a speech and they laughed at the right time and had the right reactions they spoke english they came up afterwards and surrounded me with their business cards and desire and ideas to rebuild iraq it was encouraging to watch the spirit within then if they can get the oil out of the ground and get the revenue stream coming back into that country they will be a long way along in their recovery the argument that this is a situation when we go alone repeated over and over again the gentleman from florida made that statement we went it alone in iraq i have been over to iraq a number of times i remember standing in the headquarters of the coalition forces in basra general dutton of the british army was there as we stood there and had an informal conversation i began looking at the flags on the shoulders of the soldiers the coalition troops have the same uniform with their flag on the shoulders i took pictures so i could remember which nations were represented and i can remember a few great britain yes the netherlands yes romania was there the australians were there the poles were there the danes were there there were probably three or four other countries represented just in a random group that were standing around there the coalition forces i dont think the gentleman from florida went to visit the coalition forces he visited the american troops and forgot there were thousands of troops there that came from other countries and have been in iraq from the beginning and have stayed there in fact the japanese sent 1 000 troops into iraq because they understand the value of freedom even though they are a relatively passive nation then the half a dozen or so generals that disagree with the presidents policy in iraq and the continued argument that the president did not listen to his advisers and now they have these retired generals that say we should have done this or that the president has always listened to his advisers and generals he understands he is not going to call these shots from the oval office he is going to say you are going to have what you need to get this job done but six generals it appeared to me there are a few more but that is the count that i had they appear to be positioning themselves for some future role in politics if we watch them i believe we will see one or more emerge as at least an adviser to a presidential candidate if not a presidential candidate themselves but i will see your six generals and i will raise you 9 000 30somethings there are 9 000 generals in the united states military and they stand with the commander in chief so you have a long way to go to convince me that just because you find six folks with political aspirations we should alter our entire mission in iraq to accommodate them they would find something else to be critical of and the most outrageous statement of all from the gentleman from florida we have a plan in the war in iraq his question to republicans was where is your plan well i think maybe he got that script wrong i think he probably understands that we do have a plan in the war in iraq it is the commander in chiefs plan i support it i suppdrt moving towards freedom for the iraqi people my question is 30something democrats people who think republican is a fourletter word where is your plan and i would further submit that after 60 minutes of that kind of diatribe i wonder what the suicide rate in america is mr speaker actually i came here to talk about a different subject matter what i want to talk about is the accomplishment that we made here on the floor of congress today and that is for a long time the american people have understood something that has taken quite awhile to go through to this congress and the white house that is we have porous borders in america the american people understand when they see people show up in their streets taking jobs in their communities and when children are coming into their schools and they are born in a foreign country and they dont have the kind of documents that would demonstrate that they have come in through a legal channel and they start to see 1 000 of them show up and take jobs and in iowa for example it would be in our packing plants there is a real large social movement going on the blastosphere opened up and began to tell america the facts of it all and some of people came down to the floor of the congress and made this case my good friend tom tancredo among those the people understood this immigration issue long before congress was able to react we need to be in a position to lead not to follow but this time i think we are following the lead of the american people and i am happy to do that although i would like to be a little more up front but that message came to this floor over and over again led by tom tancredo of colorado and a number of the rest of us stepped in and joined him we have been cafrying that message consistently at heart now for a number of years for me it is 4 years here in this congress carrying this message i sent out a survey into my congressional district it will be 2 years ago last march and it went to 10 000 households randomly selected by a computer so it would have been democrats independents and republicans scattered across the district in a random location and it was a survey on immigration i knew what i thought i believe we need to enforce our immigration laws seal our border force all traffic to ports of entry and birthright citizenship and the anchor babies shut off the jobs magnet do all those things and a lot of people go back home i believe a lot of people do that i believe the record is replete with statements to that effect and a number of pieces of policy that add to that overall philosoplfy but the immigration survey that i sent out to the number of 10 000 randomly selected households asked a whole series of questionsabout immigration that was the only subject matter the most significant question that i asked in that survey was on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most intense how intensively do you agree with this statement and then the statement reads in the survey that we should eliminate all illegal immigration and reduce legal immigration reducing legal immigration is not something that i have actually called for but and all illegal immigration reduce legal immigration and how intensively do you agree with this with 10 being the most intense out of 10 000 mailed we received 1 800 and i think the number was 96 respondents so a number that approached 19 percent returned which is about 3 times what your average return rate would be on that kind of a mailing on that question we should end all illegal immigration and reduce legal how intensely do you agree 82 percent put down 10 82 percent some of them must have held their pen like a dagger the way they wrote their notes and their comments on the surveys as i went through those and read them through 82 percent said end illegal immigration all of it reduce legal by the time you added the 7 8s 9s to those 10s 97 percent agreed with that statement and only 3 percent had an opinion down on the other side of the scale only 3 percent i would submit that if i sent a survey out to the district with a random selection like that and i said steve king says the sun comes up in the east do you agree or disagree i do not believe i would get a 97 percent agreement out of my congressional district but 97 percent want to have border control and they want to have enforcement that is what we tried to provide in this congress and we have made some significant progress last august 22 1 have to back up it was a year ago last august 22 is a little over a year ago i hosted an immigration summit in iowa i started out in des moines with radio and a lot of print coverage and some video coverage on there i had a host of very good speakers on the immigration issue tom tancredo came my good friend from arizona and powerful leader on the subject j d hayworth from arizona jim gilchrest was there who was the original founder of the minutemen we had other speakers that added on to that and one was the father of a son who was lost in the september 11 attack in new york kris eggle and they spoke about the importance of enforcement of immigration laws but if we had done so we may be and likely could have thwarted the attacks on but what happens to this country if we continue our porous borders on that day i stood up and said i want to build a fence i want to put a physical barrier on this border and i want to do it for 2 000 miles for starters i would put a 10 foot high chain link fence and i would top it with barb wire i said barb wire because i am kind of a farm country young guy the press printed it as razor wire i dont take issue with that probably razor wire makes a little more sense than barb wire but i would put the fence there i would move it about 100 feet and i would build a concrete wall that i designed and demonstrated on this floor in congress it is unlikely that i will get an opportunity to demonstrate that tonight but thats the position that i took august 22 2005 i have here with me the clippings from some of the newspapers after that they were not very impressed with that idea they thought it was a kind of radical reactionary and ineffective proposal so there are about four articles here that have reference to that and they mostly undermine my position and seek to ridicule me for having a apparently narrow mind and not having thought this through what this they forgot that i go to the border i look at the circumstances down there i gather the data i talk to the border patrol personnel i talk to the people that live there i talk to the retired border patrol personnel i see the carnage i see the litter i go to the national parks and talk to the park rangers there when they have human traffic that is streaming across that border and the numbers that they are and i sit down there on the border in the dark for hours utterly quiet and listen listen when i cant see but just dim shadows is all that i can see i can hear vehicles coming from the mexican side of the border and they stop by a big mesquite tree about 150 or so yards out there south of the border the fence is just a fine barb wire fence the wires are stretched apart in places that is where the illegals go through they dont fix it back up as one could imagine they leave it open for others there was a water tank that was there on the mexican side that is there that was where they can get their last load up of water before they start off on 20 25 miles of desert on the unitedstates side to be picked up the highway a ways i sit there and listen and i hear the vehicles come down through the desert on one particular vehicle i could hear the muffler dragging all the way along they get by that mesquite tree and they stop and the doors open then you have to listen and you can hear the sounds and it is people clearly pil ing out of the vehicle you can hear them drop their packs on the ground as they get out and they must be picking them back up again you 6an hear a little bit of talk a little bit of whisper then they start off through the mesquite to come out into the border to come into the united states you can hear theif packs go through the fence and be set on the ground on the other side and sometimes occasionally dropped on the ground you hear them climb through the fence they pick their packs back up you can see the shadows you cant quite count them you can see the image of the shadows as they go off and into the desert off north following whatever kind of a beacon they have and may be watching however they guide themselves to go on into the united states now this happens across that border on an average night of perhaps 11 000 people pouring across that border a night 11 000 to the tune of 4 million a year how do i know this i serve on the immigration subcommittee i sit in on hearings two three four times a week witnesses that come forth they are both expert on the matter both pro and con experts that bring real data to us the border patrols information is this that they stopped last year 1 188 000 illegal border crosiers 1 188 000 what a huge number santa anas army was only 6 000 strong and the border patrol stopped 1 188 000 what a huge universe of people that is theoretically at least they turned themselves and said go back through there and many of them they took down to the turnstile and watched them as they went back in mexico the year before the border patrol stopped 1 159 000 so i asked the question of the border patrol and of their representative what percentage of the attempts across the border do you intercept what percentage of success do you have the answer that i get back consistently is 25 to 33 percent when i go down to the border and i ask the border patrol that is actually doing the work down there what percentage are you interdicting and they give me answers like the most consistent answer i got was 10 percent i dont know if that really is it one of them when i said 25 percent broke up in hysterical laughter he said no that number is closer to 3 percent of the drugs and 5 percent of the illegals now that was an ice inspector that should know even if they are wrong now if they are right it is more than 10 million a year if they are wrong and the testimony of 25 to 33 percent and this is all a guess admittedly then it is perhaps 4 million a year coming across our southern border now how many go back we dont know the answer to that either we know some go back we dont know if it is big numbers as a percentage but we know it will be big numbers because there are 4 million or so that do go across we also know that 65 billion that is billion with a b dollars worth of illegal drug come across our southern border every year ninety percent of the illegal drugs in america are coming across our southern border sometimes they come across in semis sometimes they come across in straight trucks sometimes they come across in pickup trucks in fact while i was down there they interdicted a pickup truck that had a false bed in it about 7 inches of false bed underneath there there were 18 bags of marijuana about the size of a cement sack perhaps weighing about 10 pounds each i will submit 180 to 200 pounds of marijuana underneath the false bed in the pickup we took the jawsoflife and pried it open went in there and pulled those sacks out the driver i am going to tell you i believe was a ms13 gang member the most violent gang we have ever seen in this hemisphere the gangs that behead and dismember and do other things so atrocious i will not repeat them on the floor of this congress this individual had a ms13 tattooed on his arm here he had tattoos from his waist to his neck he had every look about him as an ms13 he was perhaps a decoy because they get so many interdictions of drugs down there they cannot prosecute them all so they will send off someone who has got a smaller load 180 to 200 pounds to be a diversion to be able to run the larger load through there cost of doing business well if one spends a few hours down on the border at night and listens and perhaps would have infrared night vision of some kind that they could watch actually watch the people they would come to the conclusion that it isnt the folks that are coming into the united states that want to simply get a job working on farms or whatever it is they do to improve their lives just they are coming here for a better life actually the position that has been taken by the administration we cannot stop people that want to come into the united states for a better life it is too powerful a force we have to let them come in and legitimize them by giving them some kind of identification but i would submit that we can stop people from coming into the united states for a job for a better life we must be able to stop people from doing that because the force that drives them isnt nearly as powerful as the force that drives people to bring illegal drugs into the united states so i am going to say we can stop lettuce pickers and people that want to work on farms and factories in plants we must do that because if we cant do that we dont have a hope of being able to stop the illegal drug smugglers that are coming into the united states so when they come through in a semi which is more rare now or smuggle through in a straight truck when there has been a diversion or maybe a pickup load gets through with the marijuana load under the bed when that all happens large quantities of illegal drugs come into the united states but that is not the only way they come in they also come in on the backs of burros individuals who are sneaking into the united states with 50 pounds of marijuana on their back they might back 15 miles or further to get to the united states border to walk across the unitedstates desert and then get across that border as ice described while i saw there and walk across the united states and walk another 20 25 miles and be picked up along the highway somewhere they toss their marijuana into the truck some get into the truck and go on and stay in the united states some return back to mexico and get another load some turn around and walk back all the way across the desert to get another load that is the kind of thing that is going on with that kind of force on the border with that kind of push a push of 4 million people a year coming across that border intercepting 1 188 000 of them 65 billion worth of illegal drugs 90 percent of the illegal drugs in america coming across that border that includes the marijuana the cocaine the heroin and the methamphetamine which is a big big problem we have shut down the meth labs essentially in iowa that just meant that it used to be 85 percent of the meth came from mexico and iowa now it is much closer to 95 or more percent of the methamphetamine comes from mexico because we shot down the meth labs in iowa zi 2230 but these burreros will haul 50 pounds of marijuana each and they will come in groups of say 8 to 10 10 to 12 up to 50 in fact there is a pack train of them that went up to 100 each with marijuana on their back roughly 50 pounds carrying that across the desert and they drop litter all over the desert and invade our natural areas in fact here i have here on this stand a picture of a natural area and it is quite interesting this is a picture of one of four locations where the longnosed bat an endangered species inhabits a nest and this is on the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge in arizona i have met with the national park service director and this location is the location where this bat cave as you see was invaded by illegals this was one of their stopoff pointst they could get in there and get cool and rest up a little bit for their trek across the desert so as they came into this bat cave they chased out something like 1 600 bats that lived in there and the bats left we dont know where they went to nest necessarily at least i dont but for 2 years there wasnt a bat in this cave so now we are down to three locations where these rare longnosed bats can live and reproduce so the national park service looked at this and said boy we really dont like to build fences around in our refuge but what are our alternatives if we want to save the bats so they followed a path that seemed to work and that is put this wrought iron fence around here that has spikes that lean out it is about a 75 000 project they built a fence around the bat cave and when they did that the illegals did not come into the cave any longer and the bats came back the bats have been in there reproducing ever since in roughly the same numbers they were before their cave was taken over by the continual flow of illegals that are coming across our natural refuge so i would argue to those that say a fence doesnt work here is a perfect example of how a fence worked at least it kept them out of the cave and now we have a species of bat that is going to be more healthy than they would have been otherwise this is just an interesting little thing that i did i have said that the people that vote for amnesty will be branded with a scarlet letter a for amnesty so by ajo arizona there is a big letter a up there on the mountainside i took a picture of that we colored it up so it is scarlet that is the scarlet letter a that is the brand we dont need amnesty that is why it has a bar across it we need to have the rule of law we need to respect the rule of law that is part of america this is the fence and concrete wall that i designed you can see this portion here this will be slipform footing that goes down perhaps 5 feet and it would be 5 feet and you form a slot in there and you can put a trencher in and put this slip form in and pull it all in one motion and pour concrete as you go trench and pour concrete so this gray portion becomes the footing and you can see where the white portion drops down and that is the slot these are precast concrete panels and they would be about 13v2 feet long they drop down into this slot i think that says 15 inches perhaps 18 but we end up with a constructed height of 12 feet high these precast panels weigh about 9 800 pounds they come in on trucks you pick them up with a crane you drop them in that slot you can just pop them in one after the other just as easily as i have demonstrated on this floor how that can be done once they are put together you can put a little wire on top that wire is a disincentive for people from climbing over the top you can put sensors on there vibration sensors we can put night vision on there we can do all kinds of things to make sure that this wall is not breached walls make sense fences make sense the bat cave is safe from the illegals we can make america safe from the illegals by simply spending some of this hardearned cash the 8 billion being spent to fund our border patrol on the southern border we can make a onetime capital investment it is about 4 million a mile now being spent to control our border and we get about 25 percent efficiency if we would spend about 2 million a mile all the way through those 2 000 miles we would end up with a far higher percentage of efficiency i beliee that number would go over 95 percent if we patrol the border if we put the sensors on surely a fence isnt the only solution but it is a great big wonderful effective tool for our border patrol they could finally aspire to get operational control of the border then there needs to be a solution for the locations where water is going to run across through the gullies we have these solutions in place in many of those locations already these are hbeams that are driven in steel beams that are staggered and welded together here on top with a horizontal beam so they cant be spread apart this lets the water through it will collect the trash and over time you have to clean the trash up but no one can go through there except some wildlife can get through and it does work it is a little more expensive but we will have to do that where the water runs there are engineering solutions to everything we might want to do this is an example of what is happening to our national parks i am not certain whether this is in oregon pipe cactus national monument or in the cabeza prieta but it doesnt matter this is federally preserved land this is precious natural resources that we want americans to have access to look at what we have graffiti painted on the stones graffiti that probably will take years and years and years to ever weather away if it does at all something that is really very difficult to clean up when the paint goes into the pores of the stone down here is just a small example of the kind of litter that we are finding in our national parks some of that litter it is estimated that an average illegal will drop about 8 pounds of litter as they cross the desert eight pounds times 4 million people is a tremendous cleanup problem and it threatens our natural resources it threatens the wildlife in fact about onethird of oregon pipe cactus national monument is now off limits to the public because the concentration of illegals is so intense that the park officers fear for the safety of american tourists in our own national parks because they are threatened and that would be the oregon pipe cactus monument where there officer kris eggle was killed in a shootout with drug smugglers coming across the border i have been to that location there is a memorial that is there in his memory and the memory of the other officers who have given their lives for security i am committed to security for this border so today we passed 700 miles of fence off the floor of this congress this is the third time we havehad a good fence vote here on the floor by my recollection the senate has had two good fence votes over there they are going to get another one they are going to get this bill i am happy to call it the king bill thanks to peter king from new york they are going to get a bill over there and my advice is to the unitedstates senate chew on that awhile i expect the voters will chew on you awhile we are going to take this message to the american people and say let us continue with this message on enforcement fences work there is proof positive that they do no one says where we have built them that we should tear them down they are essential tools they are a capital investment they are a onetime investment and yes we have to patrol and yes we have to maintain them but we get a great return on that capital investment that means it doesnt take as many border patrol officers to secure this border it means that they can be deployed to places where they can be more effective it means that the 4 million people that are coming across our border and the 65 billion worth of drugs will have to find a way to try to sneak through a port of entry which many will try to do and we can beef those up and put more resources there or they will go around the ocean and get out there where the coast guard can do their job and the coast guard has interdiction abilities that supersede those or i will say they are superior to the border patrol so i am ready to force all traffic through the ports of entry i think we must do that i call upon the united states senate to pass the legislation that we passed on the floor here today august 22 2005 i said build a fence build a wall build a barrier 114 days later this congress passed that legislation as part of a larger bill and i have watched as perhaps the most liberal member of the united states senate voted to authorize a fence and voted to fund a fence this extreme notion that comes from a conservative member of congress is mainstream the white house recognizes we need physical barriers to assist and that we need to have enforcement at the border we will have that we will get that done and we are moving quickly it wont all be done by novembdr 7 but a lot of the pieces will be put in place by this republican congress and i am proud to serve with you all and i am looking forward to being part of this solution i am looking forward to going down and setting some posts myself"], [0.9872855544090271, 0.9872855544090271, 0, "scooter libby has been

information regarding iraqs supposed efforts to build a nuclear weapon information made public in president bushs state of the union message in january 2003 special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald was chosen to determine if this revelation regarding valerie plame wilsons wife violated the intelligence identification protection act the actual indictment of libby did not claim such a violation occurred instead he has been charged with lying and participating in a coverup during the 2year investigation i believe this is a serious matter that should not be ignored e 1930 but it is not an earthshattering event this case like almost everything in washington has been driven by politics not truth justice or the constitution it is about seeking political power pure and simple not unlike the impeachment process during the last administration there are much more serious charges of lying and coverups that deserve congressional attention the country flow knows the decision to go to war was based on information that was not factual congress and the people of this country were misled because of this more than 2 000 unitedstates troops and many innocent people have died tens of thousands have been severely wounded their lives forever changed if not totally ruined the lies scooter libby may or may not have told deserve a thorough investigation but in the scheme of things the indictment about questions regarding the release of valerie plames name a political dirty trick is minor compared to the disinformation about weapons of mass destruction and other events that propelled us into an unnecessary war it costs in life suffering and money have proven to be prohibitive the libby indictment unless it opens the door to more profound questionsconcerning why we went to war may serve only as a distraction from much more serious events and lies the decision to go to war is profound it behooves congress to ask more questions and investigate exactly how the president congress and the people were misled into believing that invading iraq was necessary for our national security why do we still not know who forged the documents claiming saddam hussein was about to buy uranium from niger was this information concocted by those who were overly eager to go to war why was cia reluctance regarding this assessment ignored allow ing it to be presented by the president as a clincher for our need to go to war other reasons used to justify the war deserve equal attention since the results have been so painful for our country if lies were told to justify the invasion of

to our church services the way that they did in the reagan administration with regard to the soviet union they said please we will stand with them we want someone someone from the bush administration to come into a house church we are tired of seeing the bush administration going into the churches that are recognized by the chinese government so i wrote every high appointee in the bush administration and i asked them would they call the individuals and stand with them go to their apartments as we used to do in the 1980s in moscow with the sakharovs and the scharanksys and in 3 months not one bush administration person has taken the time to pick up the telephone and to call the name and the telephone numbers of the individuals what do you get out of the bush administration silence silence we should remember the words of dr martin luther king who said and i quote in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends and dr kings statement is so poignant in times of trouble the silence of an enemy is expected but the silence of a friend is devastating i ask the bush administration to break the silence speak out for riba qadiri speak out for the catholic church speak out for the evangelical church speak out for those in tibet who are being persecuted the young buddhist nun who came to my office 2 weeks ago had been in the drapchi prison for 15 years for doing nothing this is a test i am writing the bush administration officials again and i am giving the telephone number to call i say now with this opportunity and i am going to give them the words of dr martin luther king silence should be over it is now time for the bush administration to adopt the policies of the reagan administration of ronald reagan to stand with the dissidents because by standing next it is like in government or politics if somebody says they are really for you but they dont want to be identified with you how much are they really for you how much is the bush administration really for the catholic church in clina how much is the bush administration really for the evangelical house church who are putting their lives on the line how much are they for those who are being persecuted in tibet how much are they for the uighurs how much for the falun gong and keep in mind this government is spying against our government much more aggressively than they did in the soviet union i close again with thewords of dr martin luther king in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends if the bush
